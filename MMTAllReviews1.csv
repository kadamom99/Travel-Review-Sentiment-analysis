1,"I booked a room in Bay laurel hotel, faridabad for one of my guest coming from south india. Her travel got cancelled due to flood in area. My booking phone number is not working and i have tried all the ways since 2 days no revert to my email and there's no way to connect with customer care if that number is not woring.I have made a knot, never ever use 'MMT neither for personal nor for official.Hotel staff says we can't do anything, MMT has to cancel and send email to us. MMT has no service to help guest without phone number.Booking - NH71114294390592 Worst experience - Feeling helpless no point of contact to even share your problem.In deep regret to use MMT not other platform",1

6,"I booked ticket from BLR to Delhi and there was 1200/- discount with IDFC bank card fr 6 month interest free EMI. Bank charged the 15% interest. When called Bank, they says its false promise by MMT. When called MMT call center, person is not aware about this and say s its between Bank and me. I am attaching the offer snap from their site.",1

8,"Booked shimla manali package on Dec last week of 2023. Cab got changed 3 times before confirmation. Cab was arranged by a cheap local tour operator whose objective is to just get commission. However cab Driver was polite and supportive but it was his first tour to Manali and he was relying on the guidance of GPS and I was helping him with the sequence of locations. I took package to have Hassel free trip but that was not the case. For hilly terrain CNG/Petrol Cab is not recommended. But we were provided CNG/petrol Cab. There were trouble climbing few places and we have to get down and walk. Sending non experienced Cab Driver in such a Hilly area is very Risky. Travel part was really pathetic and there were addition Rs 2400 charge to pick up and drop from gurgaon. I had updated my pickup and drop location while booking. I was not informed about this addition charge. It came to me as last minute surprise. When I spoke to customer care about this their response was very pathetic. They said you have to pay. No other option. Else trip will get cancelled without any refund. And they proudly said in online booking we don't validate pickup and drop location. Pathetic travel experience. This package should be renamed as ""shimla Manali fool making package""",1
9,Not at all satisfied with the services.The customer service was very rude and not at all understanding.The cab services were very poor . Don't ever book a cab from make my trip. It is a scam company.,1
10,"I don't know where to get started. Customer service is absolutely unsupportive and rude. App didn't have the option of selecting the number of luggage unlike it has for number of people. Sent a car with hashback having space for only 1 luggage for 4 hrs interstate travel of 4 adults. What do you expect? We had to travel with all our luggage in our laps. Customer service didn't try to understand the problem, told us that even if we cancel the cab no money will be refunded nor any other cab will be booked. Charged a handsome amount of money for every EXTRA baggage according to them. FRAUD COMPANY. ONLY TRYING TO GET MONEY BY MISGUIDING PEOPLE. ADVICE : DO NOT USE MAKE MY TRIP. YOUR MONEY WILL GO IN VAIN.",1
11,"From our very first entry we were disappointed. The place did not at all look like the pictures used for advertising. Entering the reception area we were not even greeted. As we entered our room allocated I couldn't believe that people are expected to pay for such a disgusting room. We booked the premium room that was advertised using beautiful pictures. When we entered it looked like something out of a horror movie. The sheets were covered in yellow stains, the room smelled like urine, wallpaper was tearing from the walls, walls and mirrors were so dirty it looked like muddy hands were rubbed on them. The telephone was not working at all. When we entered the bathroom I was even shocked more. The glass panel of the shower looked like it has never been washed before and was covered in limescale and mould growing from the rubber linings. The shower floor also looked like it has never seen soap or water. We didn't even want to step on the floor with our shoes on. Upon my wives utter disappointment and discomfort in the room we approached them at the office were we were told that all rooms are premium rooms. Again, not at all like the pictures advertised. After a quarrel with the guy at the reception (who refused to give us his name or photo) and made a mockery of our names using them as a pseudonym we were given another room. Again, not at all like the pictures on the website. Even more horrible and disgusting if I have to say. The bed smelled like urine, the wallpaper was again tearing from the walls. The walls were so disgustingly dirty one can't even touch it without being scared of catching a disease. We were not given any keys to the room, nor a remote to the aircon. The bathroom was full of mould being a huge safety risk for my wife and son as they are both asthmatic. We were very disappointed and immediately phoned our Indian hosting family and friend to try and speak to them due to language barriers. He and his wife were both sworn at and treated in an extremely disrespectful manner.",1
12,Fraud company On new year they cancelled my booking for getting higher price of 5000 rs And neither got a refund In extreme cold weather of -10 degree my family was thrown out of the hotel in the night after 5 hours of argument,1
13,I booked fun week to Himachal through make my trip. Upon reaching Amritsar I realised that the room was substandard and dirty. Linens were used. Towels were damp. There was no ventilation. Same experience at Dharamshala. I had to actually argue for better room. Make my trip support number also is a scam. They spoke to me once,1
14,"The bus is not arriving at its scheduled time. The passanger have many problems. Bus stops many times on way. Local traveller fill in bus, so not reached at a schedule time on station. Please solve this problem",1
15,"I booked a vehicle from Vellore to Chennai through make my trip . Scheduled time I chose was 5 pm suddenly on the journey morning came to know that I will be free by 11 am so I called their customer care . Representative Kunal picked up a phone and then conveyed that sir at the earliest we will be getting driver details by 3, pm so will communicate you. I said ok than I called them again at 2.30 pm this time executive named as Garima picked the phone and said that be onhold I waited till 25 min no response , I again called up after 5 min this time Kunal picked the phone and said sorry sir but vehicle will come by 5 pm only . I was shocked as bu this time in anticipation of hotel have already checked out from the hotel along with my kid",1
16,I am elite international traveller Star alliance and Mariott member. I have NEVER experience worst travel experience through worst agency in world. This is Huge FRAUD and NO response.,1
17,Nice bus and service Journey are so good,5
18,"They are the worst organisation ever, no response on app and as well as customer support teams. All they do is dodge your calls by saying we will get back to you l, no matter how many times you explain your scenario to them. All they do is fraud. They don't provide any update regarding the trip status, tickets confirmation or ticket cancellation, rescheduling. Also they say they will not refund any amount. Every team of their is fraud post trip, pre trip everyone, most of the time they are unavailable, even there 24/7 helpline is not answerable. Will not recommend to anyone. They will dupe you.",3
19,I’ve been trying from the past two hours to get in touch with the customer services in india. Either the calls are being automatically disconnected/the otp is not being sent or my booking id is not being recognised by the automated messages. I’ve tried at least 20 times on different numbers but none of the numbers are helpful. It’s extremely stressful and exhausting to not be able to make any changes to your bookings. And no clear or direct number to get any assistance. Horrible experience. Will never use the site.,1
20,Very unprofessional and unthinkable situation when one denied accomodation booked in advance with premium price.,1
21,Missing transparency in sharing invoice brake up. This is due to the fact that mmt charged almost double for the services offered. In addition to this services/vendors were not as committed. Will not suggest any one to go for mmt,1
22,"I dont even know where to start. It has been a horrible experience for me. Given the Indian Law practices, it has been a boon to fake companies like makemytrip. They cheat u on ur face. I booked a cab from Hyd to Vijayawada. They have delayed it by 2.5 hrs and they sent me a car thats close to breaking down and the driver is a Goonda. I have never seen such unprofessional conduct from anybody in my entire life. The car is worth a mere pile of horse dung. Pardon my french, but screw makemytrip. The customer service…. Ok thats a joke and I wont even talk abt it. In short, the entire experience with makemytrip is d most painful. I felt cheated. I am going to book a case and file a law suit as I missed my US flight because of these worthless pieces of unprofessional, unethical crap! I wish thr was -5 star rating the first time. I will sue these holes with everything I have. This shouldnt happen to anybody.",1
23,Don't use this app personally I faced very bad experience in make my trip. You can try some other with good rating i didn't see the reviews for this app if I see na definitely I won't go.,1
24,"Very bad experience, not at all satisfied, they make false promises, which they do not fulfill. Will not recommend it to anyone.",1
25,"Our recent trip to Dubai, booked through MakeMyTrip, turned out to be an absolute nightmare. From the get-go, the communication was a mess. Ms. Shwetha K M initially lured us in with promises of discounts, but the payment process was a chaotic ordeal. The package cost fluctuated like a volatile stock market, leaving us perplexed and frustrated. The lack of transparency continued as the trip approached. Nisha Kakkar's sudden demand for additional payments at the last minute was appalling. Refusal to pay led to radio silence from the team, leaving us stranded with unanswered emails. On the day of our journey, we were handed off to an unknown agency without any prior notice or explanation. Forced to cooperate out of sheer necessity, we faced unexpected charges at the hotel, attributed to the incompetence of MakeMyTrip's arrangements. But the final straw was the absence of the promised transportation on the last day. The local agency, conveniently passing the buck to MakeMyTrip, left us scrambling for a solution. The drop-off service, clearly included in our package, was nowhere to be found. MakeMyTrip's unprofessionalism and inability to manage even the basics have shattered our trust. We strongly advise steering clear of their services for international travel. It's a shame that such a reputed platform failed miserably in ensuring a smooth and hassle-free experience. Our advice? Seek travel agencies that have a direct and reliable presence in foreign countries. MakeMyTrip is not worth the headache and disappointment. This experience has underscored the need for better accountability and professionalism in the travel industry.",1
26,"We booked an all inclusive package from mmt seller and paid the full amount but the seller never told us that the package does not include gala dinner charges at the resort and when I asked her about the same she shared with me the snip of the package pdf whereit was mentioned about this. I reopened the pdf and found it was written at the last page in very small font almost ignorable. I booked the package by trusting the seller but was offered no help from her, I also raised the same MMT customer care but they also did not help. In name of these packages they are defrauding their customers. I had to pay about 55k at the resort after booking the package for about 2.25 lakhs, which they told were mandatory otherwise they would not give us our already booked room. Disappointed by MMT, would advise others not to fall in their traps if they love thier hard earned money.",1
27,"The worst customer support, they not refund payment even hotel initiated refund.i request do not use this app.",1
28,The App doesn't have a customer care service. Flight was delayed but no information was provided on the app. I had to search for the customer care number on Google and call the executive requesting to send revised itinerary. Boarding hasn't yet started and the status on the app shows trip completed. And no option to reach out to MakeMyTrip team on the app.,2
29,"Want to highlight poor and deficient customer service by #makemytrip for our recent trip to Srilanka. Package booked included rides in the itinerary at Bentota. But to my dismay at Batota we were told no rides are available. This despite us paying them full amount in advance. Moreover, excess payment was demanded by #makemytrip even after paying the the full amount as intimated by them. Our complaints to them have been abruptly closed without any refund or reason.",1
30,"I emphasize with people who have suffered at the hands of MMT and I am too a Victim. After booking return train tickets and paying extra for “Zero Cancellation” MMT Still charged additional 150/- as Cancellation charges (paid Rs. 572 just for cancellation wherein IRCTC charges Rs. 65 for the same). Both refunds have still not been received and MMT Junior Executive keep asking for your bank statement for 11 days every day, and then pretend that our 20–25 mail sent has not being received by them. DO NOT EVER USE MMT AT ALL AND ESPECIALLY FOR TRAIN TICKET BOOKINGS. YOU WILL END  UP LOSING ALL YOUR MONEY.",1

33,I purchased 1 Emirates Airline tickets from MakeMyTrip and 2 from Directly Emirates website. Due to a reason my flight got missed and I asked for refund from Emirates as well as from MakeMyTrip a fraudster company and Its been more than 2 months they didn't issue the refund neither they contacted airline for refund and whenever I called them they create new ticket and say our experts are working on your refund. When I contact Emirates they said sorry we didn't receive any request regarding this ticket and nobody contacted us for refund but these idiots are fraudsters giving my excuses that the delay is from airline end. I am attaching the evidence where timeline is clearly mentioned and till now I didn't received from refund yet. Avoid from MakeMyTrip Fraud Company and never use these fraudsters if you dont want to be scammed.,1

36,I had booked a holiday package from makemytrip on the last day they said that I have to cancel 1 day from itinerary because they have incorrectly booked my return flight. They refused to give any refund of the cancellation and not talking any responsibility to the mistake. They asked me to give more money to correct the flight and other hotel booking. THE AGENTS WERE ALSO VERY RUDE AND NOT HELPFULL AL ALL. I suggest please do not book anything from this site.,1
37,"I took a cab service and driver charged me extra amount. When I contacted MMT customer care service they did not turn up, I contacted many times wrote so many emails but no response I think MMT is tied up with cab drivers and they share the extra amount which will be taken from us. This is a official way of begging. I hate MMT",1

But on 13th December when I reached the hotel, then hotel Owner denied to provide me room and said that all rooms are already booked. I personally recommend to all Indians to avoid this make my trip. They are fraud and they no authenticity.

39,"MMT is totally fraud and not value for money. No support from any department after making payment. We have taken tour plan of Kerala, MMT gave worst plan and around 35% extra costing.

46,I have very bad experience with make my trip. I had train reservation in trip guarantee from nagpur to Mumbai and ticket booking date was 3 months before departure date . They charged extras amount for guarantee trip but finally trip was not confirmed. So you can't rely on their services.in trip guarantee they have policy that 3 times amount you will get in form of wallet. But I never got. I booked ticket on 20th August 2023 and departure date was on 22nd November 2023. Till today I didn't got amount refund. I will take legal action against make my trip. If negative rating option will be der then I will give it. Their customer never get you back or reply,1

There is absolutely zero response from her almost after a week. After waiting for few days, I have booked through another tours and travels with much more better experience. In this way, MMT has lost a probable customer. I caution others to think before booking with MMT.",1
50,"Make My trip review Recently I booked the above package with MMT for myself and a friend with our spouses. We customised the standard package with 2 Nights in Jaisalmer, 2 Nights in Jodhpur and 3 Nights in UDAIPUR we had requested for 3 star Plus  hotels and were assured of the same. We booked a private car for the full tour. The following was my experience Flights: Probably the only saving grace of the package. The flights were good Hotels: 1 night in TRIPLI STAY INN DESERT CAMP. JAISALMER The experience was good 1 night in SKY PLAZA   Jaisalmer. Though this was not a 3-star hotel the only good hotel we experienced in the whole trip 2 nights in PARKK BOUTIQUE Hotel JODHPUR. It might have been a good hotel in last decade. Now it is very rundown and cockroaches infested. It is nowhere near  3Star. Service was atrocious and Breakfast was at best mediocre both days. Entrance staircase was so high I doubt if it is friendly to old people. They were too stingy in supplying Drinking water as they provided only 2 500ml water bottles or 2 people.  There were no Tissues provided 3 nights in Hotel GORBANDH UDAIPUR. This again was touted as a 3 star hotel by MMT which is nowhere near the truth. This cannot be even classified as good A Grade Hotel. The rooms we were given were Stinking as soon as we entered the rooms. The flush in our room was not working and when we complained initially they tried to repair it superficially only when we complained again and demanded to change the room did they repair it properly. Still the water was leaking continuously making sound all night.  They did nothing about the stink. The shower head was leaking so much that half the water was spraying upwards instead of thru the shower head. The mixer needed change may be for the past 2-3 years but no one seems to be bothered. The second day they did not even clean the room. When complained   I was told I did not ask for it. In my 45 years of International and Domestic travels no hotel ever told me that I have to ask for cleaning. It was automatic. CAR: we booked a car for the entire trip. The car was clean and Good. The Diver was good initially. Only problem with him was that he will take us to only those places where he will get commission or a free meal. Usually these places are very expensive Tourist Traps. When we didn’t take the services at these places The Driver would get Very disappointed and surly and uncooperative for a long time afterwards.  He would tend to drive a minimum he could get away with. Always trying to run away at 3-4 Pm. He would never give us any information unless asked for. Example at several temples and monuments where photography is restricted he could have told us before hand to leave the cameras and mobiles in the car. Instead we would only find that when we reach the place and were told by the security. Interaction with MMT When MMT finalised the Package, they have not Given us any Detailed itinerary. They have only given us Air travel Tickets and Hotel Booking Details. For local sight seeing they just put Day at leisure. Which means we were at the mercy of the Driver. On day two He told us He is leaving us at 3 PM in JAISALMER. When we insisted that he should take us to The lake and puppet show He became angry and sullen.  On day 3 when we reached Jodhpur at 3 PM he just Dropped us at the hotel and went away. We could have visited the garden and one more place that evening. When asked MMT service Desk about this they took the complaint and told me they will call back in 30 min which they never did. Next Day morning when I called again a new agent checked and told me that Sightseeing is not included in our Package. (As if we were Idiots to go all the way to Rajasthan to sit in the Hotel). They Never clarified about the sightseeing and The driver? Car Scope. On Day 5 when we reached Hotel GORBANDH and found it to be not suitable I contacted Mr. Santosh Kamble Local Tour Manager in Udaipur, and requested to see if the Hotel can be changed  He told us he will get back to me. Next Day afternoon when I received a call from someone claiming to be from MMT, To my surprise He informed  that they are (MMT) not handling our Hotel bookings but are sub contracted to local vendors. With all the above experiences and adversities  I fail to Understand why MMT is charging us so much money and subcontracting everything. Their claims of 3 star Hotel seems to be their own star rating.",1
51,I had opted for a train booking with trip guarantee. When i booked the ticket I got intimation on WhatsApp email sms. But when the ticket was not confirmed..there was no intimation of trip guarantee voucher on WhatsApp or email. They quietly sent it on sms.

But nowadays Make my trip has changed service provider may be for more profit.Now problem is they will call you and ask to cancel tour. Sometimes Driver will be in hurry and rash driving will be there even if you are traveling with a patient, he will not listen to you. Sometimes Driver will ask for additional amount ranges from Rs 150 to 400 for toll or additional km. If you deny then they will threat you on phone.

62,"I recently booked a trip to Sri Lanka and the Maldives through MakeMyTrip and unfortunately encountered a series of disappointments that significantly impacted my travel experience. Flight Experience with Sri Lankan Airlines: The journey started on the wrong foot with a poor experience aboard Sri Lankan Airlines. The flight from New Delhi to Sri Lanka was below par in terms of service and comfort. It set a discouraging tone for what was meant to be a memorable trip. Poorly Crafted Itinerary: The itinerary provided by MakeMyTrip left much to be desired. In particular, the allocated time at Neura Ella & Benton was grossly insufficient. As a traveler eager to explore these destinations, I found the rushed schedule disheartening. Transportation Nightmare: A major setback was the car provided in Sri Lanka, which not only was in poor condition but also broke down during our journey. Waiting on the roadside for a replacement car for four hours was an unforeseen and frustrating ordeal, greatly disrupting our plans. Mismanaged Flights to the Maldives: The flight arrangement to the Maldives was ill-planned, resulting in us reaching the resort at 8 PM, cutting short our time in what was supposed to be an amazing yet expensive retreat. Additionally, the early check-out on the last day further reduced our time at the resort, diminishing the value we expected. Poor Resolution Despite Efforts: Despite multiple attempts to address these issues with MakeMyTrip, the resolution offered was poor and unsatisfactory. It was disheartening to see the lack of adequate response or compensation after significant persuasion. My aim in sharing this detailed experience is not only to express my disappointment but also to caution future travelers. MakeMyTrip's services fell short in multiple aspects, impacting the quality and enjoyment of what was meant to be a dream vacation. I urge MakeMyTrip to seriously reconsider their approach to trip planning and customer service to prevent similar experiences for other travelers in the future.",1
63,"After ""checked in"" apartment 2BHK for two family at 12:30PM(check in time -12:00pm), cleaning was not completed (half hour taken to clean and then we informed their person about fan and washing machine not working.

64,Everytime I call they tell they’ll arrange a call back. But none came and when you ask the same. They disconnect the call. If they can’t help with travel why give commitment?,1
65,Customer services showed Absolutely no ownership of booking cancellation. Had booked an out station cab and it was cancelled last minute. No support to find another cab. Treated a customer with no respect and no effort to find another cab. Finally I had to find a cab on my own at double the cost and Was delayed to start my trip for 2.5 years. Did not even provide deserved compensation. They only penalise the vendor and make my trip bear no ownership or responsibility to beat any losses. Their vendor personally called me to say that they were penalised by makemytrip. Absolutely disappointed… never rely on makemytrip.,1
66,"My booking with Hilton Resort goa via MakeMyTrip turned out to be the worst booking I ever made , as the room booked was of a higher price but the booking voucher received from MMT after the payment confirmation did match the room category details that was selected before the payment. After multiple follow up with the customer care, I was blocked to get in touch with any of the superior and ultimately I was not given the room for which I paid, instead I was told by customer care that I should have taken the screenshot of the room selected before the payment was done.So guys , indirectly MMT is  telling us that they will fraud with you so better keep the evidence ready, either make a screen video of the selected room in order to get what you have paid for. Else you will be conned like me with extra money being charged for a high end room but instead  end up with a cheaper room.Do not get your holiday ruined because of the Fraudsters like MakeMyTrip",1
67,"If I could leave 0 stars I would. This is by far the worst company I have ever booked with.

Pls don’t loose money by this website its completely scam. This is happen for lot of customers .. Thanks,1
71,"Subject: Urgent Attention Required: Disrupted Travel Plans with Make My Trip Dear Make My Trip Team, My booking ID: NL2122404135006 SpiceJet PNR: G9N57C We recently booked a 3-night trip to Goa through your service and encountered a significant issue. Our return flight, originally scheduled for the 12th, was unexpectedly rescheduled to the following day, as communicated by Spice Jet this morning (10th Nov). Given the urgency of our situation and the importance of being home by the 12th, especially during Diwali, we are disheartened by the lack of communication regarding this change from our travel partner. It is concerning that such a fundamental alteration to our plans was not proactively conveyed, leaving us in a difficult position. We kindly request your immediate attention to this matter, seeking a prompt resolution to ensure our timely return. It is our expectation that your team can swiftly arrange an alternative solution and communicate the same to us at your earliest convenience. Thank you. Ramkumar V 7358294535",1
72,"I'm extremely displeased with my experience with MMT. I had reserved a cab from Delhi to my hometown for an early morning ride on the 10th of November at 6 am. To my dismay, up until 5:30 am on the 10th, there was no driver assigned, accompanied by a vague message claiming they were ""in the process of allocating your driver details."" Suspicious, I contacted customer care, and by 5:55 am, they casually informed me, ""Sorry, we cannot find a driver and are canceling your booking."" There was no prior notification, no apology—just an abrupt cancellation. This has been my worst encounter with MMT, and I won't be using their services again. To others: be cautious and don't rely on MMT, even if your bookings show as ""confirmed.""",1

MMT was not aware of it till my date of travel and did not bother to inform me of the same. On the day of travel MMT mailed me an invoice copy for my hotel booking. Such is the level of carelessness on the part of MMT that the booking was cancelled by the hotel almost 25 days prior to my travel they were not aware of the same and failed to inform me of the same. I being a female solo traveller was stranded in the middle of night and was left to myself to search and fetch an accomodation. When I got in touch with MMT they were very only apologetic  for the cancellation and initiated a refund which would be receivable by me nearly after 20 days. Due to the carelessness of MMT  I had to go through the harassment  in the middle of the night and the inconvenience and mental torture. So unprofessional service on the part of MMT.

We had made the payment for super deluxe houseboat, ie castle on waves super delux houseboat. But the boat allotted to us was no where of the same category.  We were allotted Aqua Cruise. The services were pathetic to the extent that there was no proper cutlery .... no spoons no bowls . In fact we were asked to serve ourselves sambar and curd in disposable glasses. On complaining they said there's no cutlery and everyone here eats in this manner. The number of fishes were counted as per the number of people ....were not authorized to take any more!  Further we were 7 people and were given only 5 fishes. The AC was not cooling enough . Remotes were not given in the respective rooms.

These are nowhere the facilities provided by a super deluxe houseboat.  We were given a very inferior category of houseboat,  as compared to what we had paid for .The services,  the room conditions was extremely poor .

89,"Financial Loss and a Disastrous Experience My recent trip to New Delhi, spanning from October 22, 2023, to October 24, 2023, brought about a series of unfortunate events. During this visit, I attempted to reserve a room at the ""The Ashtan Sarovar Portico"" hotel on October 22, 2023, for a two-day stay, using the MakeMyTrip platform. Initially, the room availability was displayed with a price of approximately Rs. 14, 000 for the two-day duration. I diligently provided all the required information and completed the transaction by making a payment of Rs. 14, 872.00 through my credit card. However, my joy soon turned to dismay when I received a confirmation email indicating that my reservation was for a different date, specifically from October 28 to October 29, 2023, lasting only one day. To make matters worse, the email contained a stern message: ""This booking is non-refundable. You will not get a refund if you cancel this booking."" This entire experience has left me deeply dissatisfied and disheartened. I am sharing this unfortunate incident to bring attention to the potential pitfalls of technical glitches and to caution others about the risk of losing their hard-earned money. After this distressing ordeal, I have decided not to use the MakeMyTrip platform again.",3

MMT offers so many options for local activities but some of the activities are not even available. I called MMT customer service multiple times and that is another disaster. MMT's local travel partner, Arbhi Travels lies about giving us the tours that they did not give.

Also, the hotel is claiming they didn't any contact from the MMT team. So both of them are lying and looting money from people for no reason.

105,"I wanted to share my feedback on my recent trip to Mussoorie, which was booked through MakeMyTrip. Unfortunately, my experience was far from pleasant, and I believe it's essential to bring certain issues to your attention. Lack of Proper Explanation on Terms and Conditions:At the time of booking, my travel expert, Sonia Gidwani, did not adequately explain the terms and conditions of the package. This lack of information led to a situation where I had to arrange for an Uber/Ola cab to reach the designated Makemytrip cab. Traveling with a one-year-old baby and luggage bags made this task incredibly difficult. Additionally, when I inquired about adding a home pickup to my package, I was informed that it would cost an additional Rs. 1500. This lack of transparency was disappointing. Inadequate Itinerary:The itinerary provided by MakeMyTrip did not cover most of the attractions in the hill station, which was disappointing. I expected a more comprehensive experience, given that I booked a package through your platform. Hotel Room Selection:I was disappointed to find that the hotel room provided did not meet my expectations. I believe that when a customer books a package through MakeMyTrip, it should ensure that the cheapest hotel room will not be automatically booked. Lack of Flexibility:I was dissatisfied with the inflexibility displayed by MakeMyTrip when I tried to make adjustments to my package after paying my hard-earned money. The response I received from customer care was consistently, ""It is mentioned in our Terms and Conditions, any deviation will cost extra for the customer."" This lack of flexibility left a negative impression. I believe it's crucial for MakeMyTrip to address these issues to improve the overall customer experience. I hope that my feedback will be taken into consideration, and appropriate actions will be taken to avoid similar situations for other customers in the future. Regards, Deepak",1

Following are the horrific list of experiences me & my wife had- Hotel room was extremely small from what they had shown in pictures. When complained about this they said all their rooms are currently occupied. Hotel room was very dirty. Curtains were torn. Pillow covers were torn and dirty. Bed sheets had stain on them, and were smelly. Housekeeping of the room was to be asked every day. No hot water in the bathroom. Electric kettle and the works was to be asked( this is a standard accessory/amenity provided in a regular hotel room) Food provided in the hotel restaurant was limited & when asked for more, they refused. There was no help from the “SO CALLED LOCAL GUIDE-CUM-DRIVER’’. When complained about all these, MMT told us that we would be compensated by 2000₹ coupon for any dining. We uploaded the receipt as directed by MMT to get the reimbursement but till date, on 15 Oct 2023 we have not received any refund for the same.

I have informed the Holiday Expert to get in touch with the concerned authority from MMT and informed to only give me a call on Whatsapp as all other mediums of calls where blocked as I was in diffrent country. I was given only one of the two options by the airlines. Get a rescheduled flight for the next day Take the next avaiable flight to Chennai(ID-6018T). I had to take the second option since I had to reach India and staying in a diffrent country for more than a day was not an ideal option.  Once I reached Chennai I had to make my personal arrangments to reach my original destination(Bangalore). I got a call back from the concerned authority from MMT only the next day and informed me that they could not reach me because my phone was unreacable since I wa in a diffrent country. I had originally informed to the Holiday Expert to ask the concrened person to call me on Whatsapp Only and I hope it was intimated to the concerned authority.

164,"Diagnosed with bulging disc on 10th August 2023, which was pressing against my sciatica nerve – causing excruciating pain down my entire right leg.  Was unable to walk for more than 2-3 minutes without having to sit down.  My flights with different airlines were due on 17th and my booking with makemytrip was for 31st Aug 2023 – the last leg to get me home. Had to cancel entire plans as was in so much pain and all other airlines, even booked with other websites, offered to either waive the cancellation fee or change the date free of charge.  I provided all medical certificates and doctor’s reports stating that I should not fly. Contacted Makemytrip 22nd August, was advised to apply online to cancel the flight on medical grounds. Nobody called back.  Only an email stating they tried to call me several times.  No missed calls on my phone.  24th August, called them again, still no news.  25th Aug, advised Emirates don’t offer medical waiver.  Called Emirates, they state that they don’t even see the medical reports and the Makemytrip have full control of the cancellation.  Basically had zero help from Makemytrip and time was running out on my ticket.  I called nearly everyday and sent over 10 emails asking for updates. On 30th Aug(me calling again) was finally advised they cannot do anything except to cancel the flight and charge the normal cancellation fee!  Even though the previous person I spoke to said that they have raised the case to somebody higher up – with of course no response from anyone. Had they told me this info 5 days prior, I could’ve cancelled, got half my money back and rebooked myself the same flight on a different date at only a little bit more.  Upon checking the flight I wanted, it doubled in price and Makemytrip had the nerve to ask for over 3500AED more to change the date for me on 30th Aug.  Asked to speak to manager which they advised somebody will call in 24 hours.  Guess what, as I am writing this, its been 35 hours.  Of course nobody is calling back. 31st Aug, I cancelled my trip myself online and will get less than half my ticket price back, as I had NO OPTION because I would’ve lost everything if the flight had taken off without me cancelling first. Absolutely absurd and ridiculous how they operate with zero care and no customer service or follow up.  Every time you call it’s a different agent who knows nothing.  They will read the notes and still have no idea how to resolve.  I will never use them again and would advise anyone else to avoid them.",1

166,"I am writing this feedback as a deeply dissatisfied customer of MakeMyTrip(MMT). My name is Dheeraj Kumar, and I had booked a flight from Delhi to Rajkot for my family on April 11, 2023, through MMT. The booking included three family members: MR. DHEERAJ KUMAR DHEERAJ KUMAR MS. KAVITA KAVITA MR. ABIR ABIR(Child - 3 years old) Booking Details: PNR: 66LVMO Booking ID: NF7YO0VBSXBL20IS8060 Ticket Numbers: 098-9702531671, 098-9702531672, 098-9702531673 Airline: Air India I paid an additional Rs 900(Rs 300 per family member) for seat reservation and was allotted seats 12E, 12F, and 12D. This additional fee gave me peace of mind, as I believed that MMT would ensure confirmed seats for my family. However, upon arriving at the airport and attempting to check-in at the Air India counter, a shocking incident occurred. Air India informed me that they had not received any seat reservation confirmation from MMT. Even though my ticket clearly displayed seat numbers 12E, 12F, and 12D, Air India refused to honor these reservations. This created a frustrating and embarrassing situation. It is evident that there is a severe communication breakdown between MMT and Air India regarding seat reservations. As a passenger who paid extra for these reservations, I expected a seamless process. However, I was subjected to humiliation at the airport, with Air India personnel insisting that I had not paid for the seats and that I had to accept whatever seats were available. This incident left my family and me extremely disturbed. I reached out to MMT through emails and phone calls in an attempt to resolve this issue. Regrettably, I have received no satisfactory resolution to date. MMT's response has been dismissive, with them simply closing my ticket by stating that the flight was on time and that I boarded it. This response is utterly unacceptable given the clear explanation of the issue I provided via email and phone calls. Closing a ticket with such dismissive comments is not customer service. I am deeply disappointed by MMT's lack of responsibility and accountability in this matter. I assure you that I will reconsider ever booking with MMT in the future, and I will strongly discourage my friends and relatives from doing so as well. I urge you to take this issue seriously and provide a fair and just resolution to restore my faith in MakeMyTrip. Sincerely, Dheeraj Kumar [+918076198044]",1

175,"Dear Makemytrip, I write to you with utter disappointment to highlight the monumental failure of your system in recognizing and addressing the dire situation faced by a customer. Incident:On 12/08/2023, I made a booking for a hotel in the evening(Booking ID: NH72090276214874). However, when I arrived at the hotel at 9 o'clock that night, I was shockingly denied check-in. The saga continued as your customer care wasted a staggering 2 and a half hours of my time until 11:30 PM. This, while my family and I were left stranded in an unknown city, enduring the torment of midnight troubles caused by your system's abysmal failure. Your customer care brazenly deceived me, with a singular focus on safeguarding your own financial interests at the cost of our safety and well-being, forcing us to remain stranded on the hotel reception and even on the street without dinner. 1.I had booked Hotel Sudha Inn and received a confirmation email at 8:06 PM that my booking was secure. However, even an hour later, the booking details remained absent from your automated voice calls system. Astonishingly, even after a full 3 hours, your customer care couldn't locate my booking ID in my profile. Imagine my frustration when, upon every call, even from my registered mobile number, I had to tediously recite the lengthy booking ID. How, in the name of professionalism, does a corporate giant like yours harbor such a lamentable lagging information system? 2.The nightmare of check-in denial forced me to communicate with your so-called ""customer care"" from 9 PM to 11:30 PM. Prepare for shock as multiple calls were unceremoniously disconnected. Each time I called back, a fresh-faced customer care executive – a different one, mind you – picked up the phone. However, they exhibited a baffling lack of comprehension regarding my predicament. My grievances were laid bare repeatedly, yet not a trace of my problem remained recorded for your unimpressive team. Apparently, your system has the memory capacity of a goldfish. In this era of seamless connectivity and high-speed networks, what kind of absurdly flawed system have you managed to create? It's astonishingly ineffective at providing consistent support for a single ongoing issue. 3.Every time a new customer care executive decided to take the stage, I was subjected to an infuriating wait of 15-20 minutes late at night. This twilight ordeal was followed by the ritual of calling the hotel yet again to verify the problem. The result? A staggering waste of time. Your system's blatant disregard for a customer's precious time is nothing short of astonishing. Do you genuinely believe in rectifying customers' problems promptly, or is it all empty rhetoric? 4.Denying check-in late at night with my family in a foreign city, your customer care failed to grasp, let alone empathize with, the gravity of the situation. The offered alternatives were nothing short of ridiculous. Proposing hotels over 20KM away, those with dismal ratings, or shoddy and budget accommodations – all without a hint of consideration for the fact that my family would have to undertake another journey at that ungodly hour. Your entire approach seems to be focused on shoving us into any hotel to save your own skin. 5.When I pointed out a better nearby hotel – Hotel Supine Comfort – with a better rating and available rooms(given that your customer care's trustworthiness was plummeting I called directly and confirmed), I was met with a shockingly false excuse for not shifting. They claimed the property was ""unsafe."" How dare you deceive your customers with such blatant lies? 6.The pinnacle of your indifference! At 11:00 PM, after enduring 2 hours of futile interaction with your customer care, it became glaringly evident that the safety and well-being of me and my family were the least of their concerns. Instead, their priority was saving a few measly bucks for your company. They callously ignored the costs and dangers associated with late-night travel. Your whole system seemed to exist in a universe where a mere thousand rupees trumps a customer's safety and satisfaction. 7.Seeking local guidance, I took matters into my own hands and ventured to Hotel Supine Comfort, where rooms were available. Astonishingly, despite my explicit pointing out, your customer care staunchly refused to budge. I booked directly with the hotel and, to my amazement, secured the room at a significantly lower price than MMT's price. In comparison, your ""coupon"" deals and supposed discounts are nothing short of deceitful. In fact, your so-called ""discounts"" are costing me a good extra Rs. 1000! What do you offer in return? A resounding failure in solving my problem. Your customer care has earned its name – it truly doesn't care about the customer. 8.Then comes the pinnacle of your grand resolution – a Rs. 1500 coupon. Is this the paltry price you place on the agony, time wasted, extra travel, and placing a family in danger? With my direct booking, I saved much more than this token of mockery. I hereby propose that you rechristen your company ""Unmake My Trip"" instead of Makemytrip. Your audacious claims of being the ""#1 travel company"" are laughable in the face of your pathetically lagging systems and apathetic customer ""care."" Expect nothing less than unapologetic dissatisfaction from a customer who has had enough of your subpar services. Rest assured, I possess all call recordings with your customer care. Should you doubt my account, I encourage you to review our email correspondence. I'm left to ponder, would a wealthier customer have initiated legal action against you?",1

188,"There’s no option below one star. This is happened with me with my international hotel booking. I’ve booked a hotel from MMT in 2 months advance but for curiosity I sent an email to the property for confirmation but they denied my booking so in the next moment I reported this issue with the MMT support and they assured me that this will be resolved in 2 days but they keep postponed the issue and told me to wait 2 days sometime 3 days. After losing my mental peace 1 month later they come up with a resolution i.e your selected property is fully booked now so you have to select alternative one. But I didn’t like any other property so I asked for my refund plus some compensation but they simply denied. So only option that I left with an alternative property so I have to choose the property which was much cheaper than my original booking amount. They also refused to refund the balance amount, so I lost around 50K. So in the end I left with unsatisfied property disturbed mental peace and ruined trip. Reference No. 17714042842165504 : NH72248272607994 Above is the reference number if anyone wants to confirm my story. And this is not the first time, in the past I already faced issue with service support but that time they told me that it will not happen in the future. So if you want to use this app to book your trip think twice because you cannot expect any kind of support from them, you’ll only be harassed.",1

My wife was trying to call the residency to get their assistance. Unfortunately, no one in the front desk could speak English or Hindi, which could be understood. We were trying to ask them to share their location on Google Map. Unfortunately, the people handling the front desk were only sharing their live location(probably as screenshot) that was not active on Google Map. My wife asked them to connect her with the manager of the residency. She was informed(in broken Hindi and local dialect) that he is on leave. Finally, around 1:00 pm we decided to return to Chennai. On July 26, 2023 I sent an email to Makemytrip for refund. Till today, almost two weeks have passed - No response from their service team, even after several reminders.",1

Just after the booking when I realized that the surname mentioned is not correct I called Air India and they told me that I need to check with MMT for correction as ticket was booked from their platform. Then I called MMT( I think numerous times) and got same response that my issue will get resolved in max 48 hours but same reply from them even 10 days were past. After chasing MMT for 10 days, I thought to reach direct to management but was surprised to got the reply that I have no option other then to cancel the existing booking and rebook Wow...

On 9th May, Makemytrip people  called and told me that the flight booked is got cancelled and informed us to  book the flight from our side.  But we couldn’t  find flight for the date it was booked, the rates were so high so we  requested to  makemytrip to  arrange flight as promised or cancel the package. When I  spoke to the flight incharge  i.e GOAIR,   quoting our  PNR number and GOAIR informed me that the refund from their side is already issued to Makemytrip on 10th May itself. But till today We have  not received any refund either air or land arrangements made by Makemytrip. Please be careful while making bookings with MakemyTrip. When I  contacted Makemytrip  several times but didn’t get any responce. After waiting for the period of holiday package,   I  asked for the refund. Till we have not received the refund or any other assistance. It is an unfair practice from Makemytrip. Suffered  mental and monetary harassment.

196,"Makemytrip is a total bogus travel guide, negligent company and a pathetic site. Staff is so illiterate that they don't even read the itinerary before sending. First they pressurize you for booking and then they tell you that listed activities and spots are not possible or available. They also charge more than actual cost. Their customer care is also ridiculous all they say is nothing can be done. A perfect trip spoiler without giving importance to customer experience. Zero guidance provided. Donot ever plan your tours with mmt especially international one. Once you make the payment then they will come back to you with all their tantrums and all you can do is nothing because they charge us for cancellation even if their staff is at fault.",1

But I felt confidence with MMT after raising complaint on today regarding my booking through customer care. I had booked a room at NK GRAND HOTEL at Pallavaram through MMT before 3 days. I reached room and check in around 10.10 pm. From that time of Check in air conditioner in that room is not working properly. After a hour confirmed that air conditioner is not working well I raised a complaint to that property. But more than a hour no response from property manager, I raised a complaint in customer care of MMT. After complaining to customer care... So many responsible persons called from MMT directly to myself.. But no one is solved my complaint. After 1.05 pm only the property alloted a new room with proper functioning of air conditioner. During the stay and complaint period we suffered a very lot and suffocated of breathing without proper ventilation in that room. I have to ask MMT that this is the immediate response? Being an MMT black customer I suffered a lot even after my complaints. What I have to trust about MMT in futures?",1

203,Makemytrip have provided the worst service to my parents who decided to travel with them to jammu and Kashmir. The package included AC car but the Ac was not working whole day. And Driver misguided my parents that going to Sonmarg is not a good idea and they might miss their flight next day if they get stuck in traffic that night and he said if they wish to go it will be on my parents own risk which was very misleading and irresponsible after paying for the package it’s their responsibility to take ownership and make sure everything in the itinerary is covered. We will never choose make my trip again.,1
204,The trip from mangalagiri to Pondicherry on 7th was a worst experience and the service was very bad . The bus I traveled was morning star was not in good condition. Iam trying to give my feedback since the day I was traveling but did not get any response. The Ac stoped working in the midnight around 1 o clock and there was no proper response for that . With out any windows I was suffocating inside the bus sweeting whole night and the day too . The bus was making lot of unusual noice and was not at all able to sleep. The whole night I traveled without sleeping and with lot of problems. It's was not a happy journey at all . They were not even ready to arrange another bus after reaching Chennai. The arrival time to pondy was 8.30 but the bus reached pondicherry by 12.30 . It was too late . They were not also ready to open the front door to let the air come in . They did not stop anywhere on the was just stop only one place for breakfast in a tea shop around 10.30 in the morning.,1
205,"I booked this taxi with make my trip from Hyatt’s to my hometown Agra in Agra, UP. Firstly, it was not a great price, then they don’t offer any flexibility in modifying or cancellation of booking. I had to change my place of pickup and time from Hyatt to Hauz Khas in Delhi. I tried using their app and online links but to my surprise, I couldn’t modify it. It was hot an d left the hotel and was on road with a luggage. I had to keep waiting and trying at highway and to no positive outcome except for harassment. Customer support is useless disgusting and only harasses customer. Firstly they won’t respond and if if they respond after multiple attempts they hardly resolve and only repeat same thing that “sorry sir but you can’t travel by same booking. You can only cancel booking but won’t get any refund. She said you can only try new booking. This was after multiple calls and waste of almost one hour of my precious time. I would never recommend anyone to book this through make my trip. It’s hopeless and disgusting experience so far!!",1

207,"I had booked the Luxury Suites hotel in Shirdi for the night of 15th July, 2023. After a few days of booking I got an email from you asking me to pay the amount and I paid using my credit card. Then I got phone calls after phone calls from one, Mr. K Y Pushkar  and I finally picked up one such call. He told me that the amount which I paid to MakemyTrip from my credit card has returned due to the system failure and the booking of ""Luxury Suites"" hotel in Shirdi stands cancelled unless I pay him upfront on his upi phone number. Being scared, I paid the amount again through upi to this person. He wrote a long whatsapp message in reply, ""Allocated Room number 4, Self-check in passcode for self unlocking smart door for your stay is 20080700(please do not share this code to any one including hotelier staff). Have a nice stay.etc etc."". Then we arrived at Shirdi railway station on 15th July. I gave Pushkar's phone number to the auto-driver to find the proper address of ""Luxury Suits"" hotel, The auto-driver called and Pushkar picked up the phone and told the auto-driver the address, but the auto-driver told me that it seems to be not proper. We went to that address but could not find such ""Luxury Suites"". Thereafter, I called Pushkar several times but he did not pick up the phone calls. The auto-driver also called several times but he did not pick up. We asked many of these hotel people in Shirdi whether ""Luxury Suites"" hotel or villa is there or not in Shirdi. We realized that we have been duped and the ""Luxury Suites"" do NOT really exist in Shirdi. We have been duped fully. In fact, MakemyTrip still puts up the hotel name ""Luxury Suites"" in Shirdi on its website with this guy(Pushkar K. Y)'s phone number. It means that this guy has even duped MakeMyTrip also. I want my money back within next few days. Or I shall put it up on facebook and twitter pages. No one will book hotel room anymore from Makemytrip.",1

209,"Very unpleasant experience with MMT trip to UK. 1) The tour guide was condescending and looked down upon Indians and women. He kept criticizing women and cracking misogynist jokes. MMT did nothing when 5 women and a couple complant about him. 2) Drinking water was not provided in few hotels and we had to spend as much as 800rs for 200 ml of water. 3) Itinerary was not planned well and we wasted 5-6 hours in the day to travel to the next destination when night time could have been utilized for the same. 4) Tour guide did not give us even 2 minutes to get our lunch/snacks packed and was in a hurry to just finish the itinerary for the day. We kept feeling hungry because of this attitude.We couldn't try local icecream or drinks due to hurry. On the top of that the tour guide was super rude even with the elderly couple. 5) No important information was conveyed to us , for instance most places in London don't accept cash, the weather required us to bring warm clothes. A whatsapp group was created just one day before the trip anfld nothing important was conveyed. Only tour guide was allowed to paste breakfast timing and itinerary start time in the group. Any other query that we pasted in the grouo was immediately deleted leaving us confused.",1

215,"I recently had an extremely disappointing experience with MakeMyTrip.com while booking a flight from Delhi to Taiwan. I want to share my story to warn others about the pitfalls of using this platform. Firstly, MakeMyTrip.com booked my flight with multiple airlines, including a layover in Vietnam. However, upon arrival at the airport, I was informed by the airlines that I needed a visa for Vietnam, even though I was only a transit passenger. This unexpected requirement cost me around$700 in additional expenses. When I reached out to MakeMyTrip.com for support, they nonchalantly brushed off my concerns, claiming that they could not assist me because it was the airlines' policies. However, the airlines themselves pointed the finger back at MakeMyTrip.com, stating that they were not responsible since I had booked through the platform. This lack of accountability from MakeMyTrip.com and the airlines left me feeling frustrated and cheated. Losing$700 due to their negligence is an unacceptable situation for any traveler. I strongly advise everyone to avoid booking flights through MakeMyTrip.com and instead opt for more reputable companies like Agoda or directly book with the airlines. MakeMyTrip.com has proven themselves to be nothing short of fraudulent, disregarding customer welfare and providing no assistance when it mattered most. Save yourself the trouble, the stress, and the financial loss by avoiding MakeMyTrip.com at all costs.",1

But never received the discount- theytrapped me very neatly knowing full well that there's no way i could reach them.Yeah, they are not reachable by email, phone, whatsapp or sms, Nothing!! Their App queries are specified to few topics which very conveniently do not address such grievances and the same goes for the utterly useless IVRS where you do not have the option to talk to a live person.

217,"I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the refund process for my cancelled air tickets. Despite numerous attempts to communicate with Make My Trip customer service department, I have been met with unresponsiveness and inadequate assistance. Furthermore, the response I received regarding the refund amount was both disappointing and contradictory to Make My Trip own policy. As per Make My Trip stated policy, I am entitled to a refund of 700 AED for the cancelled tickets. However, to my disbelief, Make My Trip representative informed me that I would only receive a refund of 450 AED, which is significantly lower than what I am owed. Moreover, they assured me that the refund would be processed within 5 working days. It has now been well over 15 working days, and I have yet to receive any refund. To add further frustration, I recently discovered that my case has been closed without any resolution or explanation. This lack of communication and closure on Make My Trip part is unacceptable and reflects poorly on the level of service I have experienced throughout this ordeal.",5

Imagine our utter shock and disgust when we discovered that the despicable owner had secretly installed cameras all over the damn property without bothering to mention a single word about it beforehand! Talk about a blatant invasion of privacy that left us feeling creeped out and violated throughout our entire stay. As if that wasn't bad enough, we were completely blindsided by the absurd restriction on having visitors at night. No one bothered to inform us about this ridiculous rule, which inconvenienced us and ruined our plans. But here's where things take a turn for the worse. When we dared to bring a few friends over (gasp!) at the ungodly hour of 4 a.m., this pompous excuse for an owner had the audacity to harass us and threaten to call the damn cops! Can you believe the nerve? Naturally, we demanded to meet at the police station to settle the matter, but guess what? The spineless coward suddenly stopped picking up our calls, conveniently avoiding any accountability for his outrageous behavior. It's clear that this pathetic excuse for a property owner has no regard for customer satisfaction or basic decency. All in all, this experience was an absolute disaster. The constant surveillance, the arbitrary rules, the harassment, and the lack of professionalism all contributed to making our stay a living hell.

235,"Our recent trip to Bali, Indonesia, booked through MakeMyTrip.com, turned out to be an absolute disaster. We cannot stress enough how disappointed and frustrated we were with the appalling service provided by this travel agency. From the moment we made the payment, things went downhill rapidly, leaving us with a sour taste in our mouths. First and foremost, after successfully taking our money, MakeMyTrip's representative, Ms. Puneet Gill, conveniently disappeared and stopped responding to our calls and messages. It was as if our booking and subsequent concerns became insignificant to them once the payment was made. The lack of communication and responsiveness was incredibly unprofessional and left us feeling abandoned and helpless. To make matters worse, the itinerary we were provided with by MakeMyTrip was completely different from what the local Bali service provider had planned for us. It was clear that MakeMyTrip had misled us with false promises and misrepresented the tour package. This resulted in a myriad of problems and confusion throughout our trip, leaving us scrambling to figure out the actual schedule and activities. When we attempted to contact MakeMyTrip's customer care to address these issues and seek resolution, we were met with the same disappointing behavior. Their customer care representatives conveniently avoided our calls, making it nearly impossible to voice our concerns or find a solution. The blatant disregard for customer support was shocking and left us feeling frustrated and ignored. In conclusion, our experience with MakeMyTrip was nothing short of a nightmare. Their representative disappeared after taking our payment, the provided itinerary was completely inaccurate, and their customer care was non-existent. We strongly advise against booking any future trips through MakeMyTrip, as they have demonstrated a complete lack of professionalism and customer care.

244,"This review is regarding my ongoing trip booked for 2 Nights Dalhousie and 2 Nights Dharamshala trip from Chandigarh  which included pick up and drop from Chandigarh and Hotel booking. I booked mu trip with booking ID NO. NL 2100243893060. Most shocking thing is that whenever  I dial the customer  care number, they are saying that we do not find this booking ID. The executive namely Neaa Mishra is too rude. She doesn't know how to behave properly. The cab driver is non cooperative. Hotels are pathetic and  the prices have  been charged that of a 3 Star Hotel by showing fake reviews and fake photos of the room. The Make my Trip has shown the rating of  Hotel at 4 .1 out of 5 whereas the same is not worth of 1 star also. No one is attending the calls. I strongly recommend to not to book any of your Holiday Plan through  this company or App. One more thing that GOIBIBO and Make My Trip are sister concerns",5

248,"Booking ID NL2102453814082:, 8 days in Nainital, Corbett & 1 more booked through MMT. Me and my family are disappointed with this trip as we feel that MMT needs more training and field experts to design and execute Holidays. All through this trip MMT acted as only a booking agent(Irresponsible one). My biggest disappointment was Jim Corbett where they gave us most pathetic Zone to Spot a Tiger. Most of our fellow guests in hotel who booked direct or through other agents spotted a Tiger or Two and they were very happy sharing their experience. There Designated Taxy was changed overnight without any information with another worst possible driver on the last day of trip and we almost missed our flight due to that. Their sales guy Vivek was the worst who simply switched off his mobile when I called him for some help regarding hotel room. In all this trip went below our expectation and I would not recommend them.",1

250,We recently booked a trip to Singapore and Malaysia.Very very poor experience. No body should book trips with them. They are cheaters. In Malaysia they booked a trip for KL towers and not for Petronas which is the main attraction. We went their by booking ourselves. They charge so much but just to fill their pockets. Never book with them. Find another people or book urselves. We asked them to change the Singapore hotel . First they said we are working on it then nothing. Useless fraud make my trip. Beware of these ppl.,1
251,"We are writing this review in reference to our booking id NL2222443848694. We had booked a holiday package for Italy commencing on 28 September, 2023 with MakeMyTrip. We were yet to apply for our Visas and had explicitly asked your agent whether MakeMyTrip will take care of the visa proceedings too. She assured us that she definitely will and asked us to make an initial payment. We made an initial payment of 1, 50, 802 on Sunday 21st May, 2023. A day later we received an update from the visa assistance  that we  won’t be able to travel to Italy on the aforementioned date as the next slot for Visa proceedings is scheduled for the 4th Of October, 2023. The concerned sales person further informed us that the visa proceedings are to be held more than a month prior to the date of departure, and since it is impossible in our case to do so she insisted us to go for paid appointment  slots for Visa which costed around 12000 Rs per person(hidden charges) which even she was clueless enough if we get a confirmed slots or not which we were eventually forced to pay for . We had repeatedly mentioned in your mails mailed to the MMT team  that it's a hidden charge which we are forced to pay for the paid  visa slot and we need a confirmation within 15 days from your end that If the  confirmation fails within 15 days we request a cancellation of our booking and demanded a complete refund as full information regarding the visa process wasn't discussed with us before and during the booking. But unfortunately didn't receive any kind of replies to our mails. Since there was no confirmation from the visa Team regarding the paid slots appointment after 15 days, we demanded for a full refund as earlier mentioned in our mails. After a couple of days passed while making multiple calls, drafting mails  to the support service team and the concerned sales person regarding the full payment refund, the concerned sales person arrived with a proposal of providing visa through Switzerland n forced us to go for it.and within a fraction of day arrived with an another proposal to get an Italy visa from Chennai centre n repeatedly forcing us to get it from Chennai centre as she had already booked for the slots without our concern as we reside in Mumbai n it is not possible for us to travel Chennai just for a tourist visa .On Here are where things get frustrating, and show a lack of professionalism, coordination, information, transparency and clear  disregard for clients on MakeMyTrip’s part. Upon asking for a full payment refund, the MakeMyATrip agent informed us that the flight tickets for my journey have already been booked, and we  will have to bear a cancellation fee if we want to cancel our trip. These lapses highlight the gross negligence on your part and the lack of communication between different departments of your organization.",1
252,"Their website looks good at first sight but that's about it! Our trip dates were changed one  (1) days prior to taking the plane. We had not received a detailed invoice but only the amount to be paid. No travel information or information package with details was received prior to our trip. The ""so called"" company representative on site was supposed to give us all we need and assist us with any issues arising... During our entire stay we had not met this ""company representative"" even once. He was hard to get ahold on the phone or on WhatsApp and never called back either! The internal communication in their offices was equal to zero and all things that were agreed by email did not get through correctly. All mistakes done on their side were dealt with terribly that finally I burst the cap and let off some steam when already at the destination and all was going wrong. It lead to the extend of them telling me to calm down and to start enjoying my holidays which they entirely screwed up right from the start!!! I urge all travelers planning any kind of trip to India, not to use this travel agency. They have also yet not refunded my airfare of GO AIR which was cancelled. After so many reminders they people are least bother to reply and also employees of Make my trip Mr Shravan Kumar , Mrs Swati Sharma and Neha Mehndiratta are also not replying. And Shravan Kumar is now saying that I am not employee of Make my trip “ Tujhe jo ukkhad na hai ukhadle” is using this type of language.",1
253,"Recently we booked a round trip from New Delhi to Chakrata. It is really disappointing to state that the car was in a very bad condition. The AC was not cooling. In the scorching heat of June we travelled 7hrs with AC having bare minimum gas. The other parts of the car were also falling apart Ike boot door was not closing properly, broken window handle, petrol lid was not closing, etc. The car axle was making continuous sound as if the car will break down anytime. By sending such a vehicle Make my trip put our lives on risk. Not ony this, our all personal details were shared to some other vendor without our consent/knowledge. My husband was shocked when he received a call from an unknown source having all his personal details. This is again a matter of safety and security of the customers. I never expected this kind of irresponsible behavior from a brand like Make my trip. I will never do any booking again from MMT and would never recommend it to anyone. Will post the same feedback on my social media and MMT platform.",1
254,"Yet again MMT disappoints. This is the second time we are being cheated by MMT. Before the booking, they will make long sweet promises and then they always fall short on them. Amount of all things is highest but never deliver. Now, we have paid 1.13 lakhs for chardham f, they said it'll be 20 person group and there's only 7 people. Second they said that breakfast and dinner is included but in this price it's just poha for breakfast and that too they are repeating on the next day too in Barkot. No other option. For dinner only 1 sabji and roti. No option. MMT ke naam bade aur Darshan chote. Highly disappointed. For query also the person in contact had stopped taking our calls. When we lied that we had to do another booking, then he called. In our previous trip too, we raised so many complaints about the bad condition of the car, they kept promising it'll get solved at some point or another but nothing happened.",5

I highly want the company to inquire about this issue our trip was GEMS OF SOUTH FROM 4th June to 9th June - Rajeev Samuel , my father was so stressed because of your I'll mannered services. Driver name is Ravi.",1
259,"MakeMyTrip has no care for customer and that's 100% correct based on my personal experience. Cancelling the bookings before their own confirmed timelines without thinking how a customer would manage at last minute and would be bound to pay more eventually to avoid other losses like flight/ other hotel bookings etc... Most importantly, we plan for a trip to go away from sorrows/ low point in life/ to make fun and to be happy. Dealing with agents like Makemytrip is the last thing we need.",1
260,"I am writing to express my deep disappointment and frustration regarding a recent booking I made through MMT(MakeMyTrip). As a loyal customer, I have always trusted MMT to provide the best prices and excellent service. However, my recent experience has left me feeling disheartened and cheated. I went through an extensive process of due diligence to finalize a package for a trip to Kashmir. During this process, I worked with an executive named Megha, who assured me that she had secured the best price for me. Based on her assurances, I placed my trust in MMT and booked the package. However, within minutes of making my booking, I discovered that another executive was offering the exact same package at a significantly lower cost, approximately 2, 000 INR less. This discovery left me questioning the integrity of the pricing and feeling deceived. I trusted Megha's assurance that she had given me the best price, and I never expected that I would need to engage in a bargaining process similar to a fish market. To compound my disappointment, I had referred MMT to my corporate colleagues based on my previous positive experiences. Unfortunately, upon sharing my recent incident with them, they too expressed their upset and loss of trust in MMT. This not only affects my personal relationship with MMT but also reflects poorly on my recommendation to others. I kindly request your immediate attention to this matter. As a long-standing customer, I believe that transparency and fairness should be the pillars of any business. I urge you to investigate this pricing discrepancy and take appropriate measures to rectify the situation. I genuinely value the relationship I have built with MMT over the years, and I hope that my trust can be restored. I look forward to a prompt resolution to this matter and your assurance that such incidents will not occur in the future.",5

262,"We had booked trip to Coorg(karnataka) through MMT. Trip was planned from 28th April to 1st of May(3N/4D) including Air tickets, stay and site seeing. MMT agreed to provide room stay at Coorg Govadana. Room size mentioned in communication from MMT as 400sq ft with photographs. But actual room size was 222 sft, room was provided near garbage throwing area. We raised issue with MMT on the 1st day of arrival itself. MMT denied the same. After so many arguments they agreed for 400 sft room for 1 night and then made us vacate the same next day morning. We were forced to shift to rrom near garbage area. This spoiled our entire holiday and we stayed like hens in box. The frustration, arguments we had, we didn't enjoyed our trip & kids were sad. We want our entire trip to be refunded otherwise we will file a case with consumer court in due course. Finally I bought measure tape from the market and draw layout with all measurement. We have all the proofs of 222sqft area of room with photographs.",1

265,"Dear All, We had booked 16 days holiday package for Sri Lanka for 2 pax from 13 May to 28 May 2023 through MMT. The land package included booking all hotels by MMT. You had booked 3 star Hotel Lake Bliss at Dambulla(Sigiriya) from 17 May to 19 May 2023. On reaching the accommodation, we were utterly shocked to find that it was ONLY a two room accommodation constructed in the jungle, one KM away from even a kacha road, with NO staff, NO facilities, NO Amenities at all for stay, eating or comfort but only one caretaker was available to open the room. Since the accommodation was highly unsafe and devoid of any comfort, we immediately contacted Ms Anita Sharma, package coordinator MMT and shared the photos of the site. She too was shocked at this totally unliveable accommodation. Photos attached. Accordingly, we proceeded to make own arrangements at Hotel Ceyloni at Dambulla(Sigiriya) from 17 May to 19 May 2023. Firstly, please check how a fake 3 star hotel accommodation when your hotel booking team is supposed to carry out verification before booking. And why this process was not followed in this case? Secondly, since I had prepaid the cost of the accommodation at Dambulla(Sigiriya) from 17 May to 19 May 2023, as part of the overall package, the additional amount paid by me at 3 star Hotel Ceyloni at Dambulla(Sigiriya) of Sri Lanka Rupees 25, 000/- plus taxes, needs to be reimbursed to me. Hotel invoice is attached for reference. Kindly resolve and revert soonest as I had raised the concern ticket on 17 May 2023 itself, no response or process on my request has been communicated. Then on 26 May to 28 May 2023, I had asked for the hotel in Bentota whereas the hotel was in Kalutara a place far away from Bentota and isolated. This was totally not acceptable. Even after raising complaint tickets many times and MMT designating Mr Surjeet as the relationship person to attend to the issues, he has not spoken even once. He called once late at night which I could not attend, thereafter he very conveniently did not bother to call. This is the efficiency, professionalism, commitment of MMT towards its customers. This is actual for all to see and assess. My experience with MMT has been very bad and developed a poor impression. I will NOT recommend MMT or myself ever to book again with MMT. I expect the extra amount paid by me at Dambulla( Sigiriya) of Sri Lanka Rs 25, 000/- to be reimbursed and hotel vouchers be given in lieu of the bad selection and wrong city booking done at Kalatura instead of Bentota. Let me see the damage control and mistake rectification done by MMT in this situation. Regards Lalit Kapoor 8800777282",1
266,Please don’t book from make my trip. If something goes wrong while booking there are not any customer care executive you can talk to. Now they have stopped their service line 18001028747.

Earlier service to solve queries was good just before two months..now .no service at all.,1
267,"I bought an international flight from Atlanta to New Delhi on 22nd May for Rs 98, 046/- and 24th May I got a message that my flight had been cancelled by the airlines and to raise refund request I needed to click on the link provided. Since then, I have experienced the true side of MMT and a lot of ongoing anxiety. 1) I had to book another ticket at a higher cost with the lost time. 2) Make my Trip said they would settle claims in 14 Days! My credit is blocked for almost one lakh since then. 3) Their Indian number provided for international callers from Indian numbers does not work. 4) So I had to borrow a local phone from someone to call their USA customer care numbers. They told me to follow up with the airlines if I wanted earlier refund - to which the airlines said the flight was not cancelled and we had to follow up with our agent. I requested that Make MY Trip speak to the airlines as the airlines would speak to the agency booking the ticket only. I was told that I needed to wait and the refund would be processed in 14 days. 5) The service agents refused to budge from their position that the refund would not be processed before 14 days and we had to wait and that we'should understand'. Their agent Gaurav just disconnected the call when we requested to speak to a senior manager. 6) Subsequently also, the customer care people will not escalate the call to their manager in spite of repeated requests. 7) So MMT basically took 98, 046/- booked and cancelled the ticket and is now not refunding the money! I AM STILL WAITING FOR A REFUND. My credit-line is still blocked by almost 1 lakh rupees. 14 days are over today but still no refund. I had been using Make my Trip for several domestic bookings and never had bookings cancelled like this. Maybe international travel needs be STRICTLY AVOIDED on this platform.

273,"In order to avoid rushing about and missing out on popular attractions, we made our initial reservation to Goa with MMT.They had decent airline tickets, but they claimed to have a reservation at a three-star establishment that was really more of a godown. They refused my request for an alternative restaurant, claiming that we had already paid for the entire excursion. I'm not blaming the hotel; I'm blaming MMT who booked this for the enormous sum of money we paid; MMT is only interested in making money. MMT executive is extremely shrewd on the phone, asking why it doesn't seem to be three stars while fully aware that the walls were painted more than 20 years ago and that it wasn't clean.My point was that it wasn't worth the money. They brought us to North Goa on the first day, but the driver was not interested in visiting all the locations they had listed for the second day's itinerary.He dropped us off at the produce market so we could shop.Very poor. The price we paid and the hotel MMT reserved weren't worth it. I will provide negative marking for MMT.Will not recommend anybody or neither we will book.",1

All the hotels were ok but the rooms you get are the worst ones as MMT gets the discount but you get the shitty rooms Trip to Ross Island cancelled, mount Everett cancelled, Sentinel hotel review dingy and dark rooms No ventilation, no sunlight, no views Lizards crawling everywhere Very poor Wi-Fi network Nautika ferry to Havelock islands Ocean tree resort in Havelock Loud and noisy fan Bathroom door bolt not working Previous customer trash not cleaned Commode flush water leaking Wash basin water leaking Persistent smell of urine in the bathroom Actual cost of trip - 62, 000₹ Hotel stay in port blair x3 nights - 30, 000 Hotel stay in Havelock x 2 nights - 20, 000 Ferry tickets to and fro- 12000 Sightseeing in port blair(corbin’s cove, Ross Island, Mt Harriet)- cancelled Parasailing , seakart - cancelled Sightseeing in Havelock- Elephanta beach - cancelled Flights - cancelled Amount paid to MakeMyTrip - 2, 20, 000 Scuba diving - 10, 000",1
294,"Booking a resort for holiday through Makemytrip turned out to be a nightmare. Would strongly recommend that no one avails that service as they screw up royally and have zero accountability. I booked for a holiday at Karjat but the owner cancelled my booking 2 HOURS BEFORE CHECKIN because MMT WAS NOT PAYING HIM ENOUGH!(Their partners are apparently as cheesy as they are!) I immediately called their customer centre to ensure that I get my refund - else they would have thrown some rule book at me. On my demand for compensation for the agony caused, they offered to compensate me for a very small part of my booking if I produced for them a GST PAID RECEIPT WITH THE HOTEL STAMP FORM A RESORT BOOKED FOR THE SAME NIGHT! SOMETHING THEIR PARTNER WOULD NOT HAVE PROVIDED TO ME ANYWAY! Obviously that was not possible as my priority was to get some resort through local contacts was 8 of us were all ready and packed to go! So I strongly recommend not to take a risk with these unscrupulous and unprofessional upstarts like MMT who become like a faceless stuck record when it comes to resolving issues or giving compensation for the agony that they cause. It seems that their POLICIES ARE GOVERNED BY THEIR FINANCE RATHER THAN THEIR CUSTOMER CARE! Use AirBnB - they have strict rules and value system and you won.t face such a situation where the host calls you to cancel your booking 2 hours before check-in!",1
295,"Never book any kind of service like air flight, bus, hotel. Because after booking makemytrip not take responsibility about any kind of residual deley and any kind of change Nd cancel. My advice is no use any kind of services on make may triple. My wrost experience to use makemytrip service. When you call to help center for any kind of issue then call assistant say only one answer. Nothing in our hand pls direct cordinate to flight authority, bus authority, hotel authority.",3

297,"As it was summer and we wanted a break, we decided to go on a vacation. We planned to explore National Parks in Assam. We go to know that most of the parks are closed starting in May, so we decided to visit Jim Corbett instead. As this trip was planned at the very last minute(1 month before), we couldn't do much homework, so decided to rely on MakeMyTrip. We came across their Nainital-Jim Corbett-Mussorrie package and enquired. The travel agent reached out to us immediately and shared the complete details, along with the spots in Nainital/Mussoorie which come with the package, anything that is not there on the list, we will need to pay extra. We crosschecked the itinerary and we were happy that the must-go places were covered. MMT package included the flight to and from Delhi and that was the biggest mistake. As per the package, it would have taken max 5 hrs to Nainital and even the return journey should have been 5 to 6 hrs so we ended up wasting 2 days on travel. It took more than 5hrs too. We should have asked for Dehradun instead. Also, the cab driver, a young guy, seemed to be very laid back. We did ask him if there are any places on the way to Nainital, but he was silent. On reaching Nainital, the next day, he dropped us at the boating point. As per the MMT itinerary, he was supposed to take us to Pangot. When we enquired, he was again silent. On top of that, we had to pay an extra Rs 3000 to the local cab to take us around the must-visit scenic places. As it was raining heavily, he could have asked us whether we needed a pick up from the boating point but alas no such efforts from his side. The next headache was related to the Jungle safari booking. We didn't get any confirmation on the same. When we reached out to the MMT agent, she asked us to reach out to the hotel at Ramnagar. When we called the hotel, the receptionist asked us to reach out to MMT. When we called MMT customer care, one of the agents asked us to reach out to the Safari team mentioned in the itinerary(How convenient!).  Only one of the MMT customer agents went out of his way to help us out. He understood our predicament and made sure that we got confirmation from the Safari team. For Mussorie, the itinerary said Gun Hill, Laal Tibba and George Everest. When we enquired with the driver, he said he can either go uphill or downhill and the choice is ours. We asked him to take us to Mall Road. He dropped us in front of Mall Road. Later we took a local tax and paid around Rs 3150 to visit Lal Tibba, Landour etc. Also, at the hotel where we stayed, we were unable to close the door to our room. After many calls, we were handed over towels. In the bathroom, the used soaps were still found(which means the room was not cleaned properly). We asked for a room heater as it was very cold, and they said we will be charged extra. In Nainital, the hotel provided the heater with no extra charges. We had booked the trip through MMT for convenience but it was very disappointing. In case anyone is planning to use MMT, you may use it for booking hotels and flights but if you are planning holiday packages through them, please use other travel agents. MMT should step up and provide a better service as more and more platforms are coming up.",1
298,"Don't want to write my wordy long experience. They are actually a fraud, the customer is bunch of idiots with ""Zero"" IQ (trust me). They are hiring such stupid people and training them to irritate needy helpless customers by putting their call on hold for more than hours. Bottom line, I lost my 45K INR because of their poor response. Only word for MMT and teams. ""Axxhxxx""",4
299,We have booked our trip for Shimla and Manali and the data is 27th May 2023.We have already paid full amount to the MMT on 2nd May 2023 and the amount is 63372/-. After some days the relationship manager contact us and informed that the go first flight issue and suggested that book alternate option.Go first flight issue is not our issue so please don't highlight again and again that the issue is not related to MMT and it's related to Airlines issue. On the basis of your attaching email we requested you to please refund our total package without any cancellation charges or provide alternate booking with your side.Now it's difficult for us to book alternate option because we have already paid full amount to your agency.Now it's financially difficult for us to manage extra amount.Its financially and mentally difficult to handle this situation.Its totally your responsibility and provide best services to your customer after their booking.We booked our first trip with your agency but we are feeling like it's a wrong decision and worst experience with your agency.Because of your issue our planning totally collapse and it's unmanageable now.Please consider our request.Attaching your email as well.On the basis of our experience i will provide you '0' rating. We have paid you extra money for our convenience.If it was possible from our side then that time we booked  on our own responsibility.But we paid you extra money as a service charge.Its now your responsibility to manage all issues or all things not our responsibility.,1
300,Suffered with MMT trauma with Gofirst flight cancelation and being asked to book own flights. Worst experience ever. Would suggest all to never book any Holiday Packages with Make My Trip. They oy accept booking and take money. There is no dedicated Holiday Package Query addressal customer support.,1
301,Its hard to explain. Mmt is a pathetic holiday planner avoid planning holidays with them and plan yourself. Being through lot of trauma due to this go-first issue,1
302,Make My Trip is sharing wrong information on the booking Id related to the Trip guarantee. I booked 3 tickets under the PNRand all the tickets are not confirmed after the final chart preparation. I booked the trip guarantee on 11th May and on the same day I cancelled one of the ticket under this PNR and after that make my trip is sharing the information that your ticket is partially confirmed. Actually one ticket is cancelled and other two tickets are still in waiting list after the final chart preparation. I have not received the 2X REFUND as confirmed by Make my trip on trip guarantee service.  Also very sad to say that the customer care facility is very very poor and  Iam trying to connect the customer care from last 2 hours  minutes after the final chart.,1
303,"This is in regards of our booking id NL2121243738342 booked on 1st April 2023 Kashmir package worth Rs 2.28lac for 3 people from Mumbai. Which was a 6N/7D trip. We were very happy to book our 1st package trip on MakeMyTrip (MMT). Little did we know this was the start of a tornado in our lives. On 2nd May we got a call from MMT relationship manager informing us that Go First Airline has gone bankrupt and now they won't be flying. We were completely shattered as to what will happen to our trip now ?? However, since we had booked from MMT we were relaxed and at ease that our trip is in safe hands. Next on 3rd May, we got a call from our relationship manager informing us that since our flight won't fly we will have to rebook ourselves on a different airline by paying another 75k for flight. Which was a shocker as we had already paid our 1st installment of RS 23000 and now they are demanding extra 75000 over and above our package of 2.28lac. However, we tried and convince our MMT relationship manager that since this was not our fault and it's beyond anyone's control, can MMT book us on another flight within our promised package ?? To which she replied MMT will not take any responsibility and the only option is to either pay the balance amount or cancel the trip by paying 15k as penalty. We asked them as to why the deduction of 15k as it's not our fault and it's the airline which has got bankrupt so why penalise the passenger ?? To this, our relationship manager replied that MMT has paid the various vendors Rs.1000 amount as booking tokens in order to confirm our package. In reply to this, we asked her to provide us the bifurcation of all the vendors they have paid. We also asked her for PNR No. of the flight which they said they have booked for us. She replied in negative and told us blank NO she cannot share the details. When we told her to book us on an alternative flight within our cost for that too she said NO. When we resonated with her that since we are cancelling our trip due to flight error so kindly hold back the token paid to the airlines and refund the rest of the amount atleast and provide us the flight charges once they get the refund from the airline that too she did not agree. Now we could not cancel the trip as we will lose the entire money of 23k and if we take the trip we pay extra 75 to 80k over and above 2.28lac and even after that there was no confirmation for our trip whether there will be any more problem or not. As days kept passing we kept requesting MMT for cancellation and initiating our refund. However, all our requests fell on deaf ears. Our relationship manager did not even sympathise with us and all the time kept asking for balance payment. As she wanted us to pay the money come what may. All this while the MMT manager and her team mates kept pressuring us to release the next payment without giving us any confirmation for our trip. Our package had a date of 10th May 2023 that if we cancel on or before 10th May 2023 we will get 8k as refund after deducting 15k as a penalty from the Rs23000 which we paid as 1st installment. We kept sending them mails from 9th May 2023 left right and centre to cancel our package and MMT relationship manager and her senior Sonali only kept mailing us to write 'We want to cancel our trip' and do not write any of your problems or request for refund, only then we will accept your cancellation otherwise the entire money paid by you will be forfeited. We declined to write what they wanted us to write and told them to accept our mail as an official request for cancellation of our package. We did not want to cancel our trip but MMT did not leave any stone unturned and made sure we either cancel or pay up the balance amount. They even confirmed us over the phone that they had just blocked our package by paying 1000 to each vendor and not actually paid them the entire amount. So it was not difficult for MMT to deduct just the airline cost of 3k and refund the remaining amount as they deal with their vendors on a daily basis. Our trip has been cancelled finally by MMT but they have not issued us a refund. We want to alert everyone booking their holiday packages from MMT by looking at Alia and Ranveer Singh but the reality is MMT does not care about its customers and only cares about the money that the customer has to go pay to MMT. In all this fiasco none of the employees of MMT ever sympathise with our situation all they cared about was their balance payment to be paid at the earliest. Not a single apology from any of their employees even after explaining them our situation a million times over the call. Our next step will be to file for a consumer complaint against MMT in order to get our full refund and compensation for the mental harrasment that MMT gave us. Instead of enjoying our Kashmir trip, we are now made to run from pillar to post to get our refund. Avoid MMT at all costs unless you belong to a bigger goon family than MMT.....",1
304,"I am writing here the review of MakeMyTrip after getting pissed off with the experience I am facing currently. Booking: IDNL2101823775706 We have booked a Trip to Sikkim from Delhi for dates 22nd May - 29th May. We have paid the complete amount of this trip which is 113857/- includes 2 adult and 1 child of 5 years. Here the flights booked by MMT is GoFirst. Since GoFirst has cancelled all its flights till 19th May, its very much sure it will cancel further too. Now we are requesting MMT to replan our travel by updating the flight. Or cancel the complete trip as flights are supposed to be cancelled. But MMT is not responding, neither ready to cancel the trip because as per them the trip cancellation date is crossed neither ready to book another flight. They are suggesting us to book refundable flight seperately for this trip so as if some cancellation happen we can go via flights we have booked. Currently the minimum charges for returnable flight 21st - 29th May is 55000/ or more than this. Now tell me after paying 1.13 Lakh they expect us to spend another 55K.  MMT we do also have our budget, when we cannot afford this amount we would like to cancel our trip. So please help us to cancel our trip, or get us the Air transfer. This review is written for all thos people who is planning there trip through MMT, please do not go with this cheat site. If they does not help you in giving alternatives its better to book the same trip through local vendor. The other vendors have given alternatives to there customer by providing alternative flight or arranging another destination trip. We are flexible with everything but common give us the option. PLEASE PLEASE NEVER CHOOSE MMT FOR YOUR TRIPS, IF THERE IS ANY ISSUE THIS TEAM IS NOT GOING TO HELP YOU.",1
305,"Even one star rating is more for MAKE MY TRIP.

We are very unsatisfied with the treatments from MMT, we  book online because we could be rest assured for our booking and it would be confirmed and the rooms would be blocked under the name of the particular guest. why would we book prior and whats the point for early booking, it doesn't make any sense to me. I am also attaching a proof of the booking slip if you think I am spreading fake rumors about MMT I also hope the people reading this review to be very careful while booking from such a FRAUD company.",1

308,"I wanted to raise my voice and share my concern about pathetic experience and No mercy situation faced while traveling to Kashmir by selecting Make My Trip(MMT) Kashmir holiday package. I selected 4N/5D Srinagar Holiday with Gulmarg and Pahalgam. Package also include To and Fro flights (Udaipur to Kashmir and Kashmir To Udaipur) and cab travels. I traveled along with my wife, 1 kid (9 years) and my father in law (65years). Being a first time traveler I had no clue about stay and I trusted MMT to plan my travel, stay and sightseeing logically, effectively and efficiently. But despite of paying 2, 34, 488 INR hard earned money there is no value for money. Inappropriate Stay: All 4 nights stay were planned in houseboat which was very far from Ghat and it was risky in case of emergency because there is no ground connectivity/ zero activities on boat. We had huge dependency on Shikara. Instead Tour Manager should have planned 1/2 nights on Houseboats and rest on hotels where we could have moved outside on street side food options. Poorly Planned Flight Itineraries: I missed my connecting flight from Delhi to Udaipur because the flight was rescheduled. MMT tour manager should have take care of my flight rescheduled since the travel was included in package. I reached out to MMT Relationship Manager Ms. Sonam and she suggested to reach out to MMT Onground staff. I tried contacting MMT Onground IVR but could not connect to customer support executive because of error in their IVR system. Despite of entering correct booking ID my call was not getting connected. I literal begged to MMT Relationship Manager but still she insisted to wait until I hear back from MMT Support. We all were badly tired after spending hectic journey and we were desperate to reach home to relax. But MMT support didn’t call me back for over 1.5 hours hence I decided to talk to carrier which I missed and I requested them to help me with another flight which they agreed to alot next day flight. That means I had to stay unnecessarily at Delhi. Until then I still didn’t received call back from MMT support. My father in law being diabetic I had to take him to hotel and my kid was irritated too since we were left mercilessly at Delhi Airport with no clue because we haven’t got any support from MMT. It was very painful situation for me because I was helpless. Finally I decided to book a hotel near by airport and stay for a night to travel back to Udaipur next day. My entire schedule got disturbed because I supposed to join office the other day. After 3/4 hours I got a call from support to apologize but resolution outcome. We were again left helplessly with no resolution and reimbursement. Overall me and my family had very bad experience and pathetic support from MMT. MMT spoiled my family vacation and my hard earned money was wasted. Being from service industry it’s very hard to save such a big amount of 2.4 lakhs INR just to fulfill family wish and travel company like MMT cheat us by leaving us helpless. I will never ever planned my holiday package with MMT and raise general awareness by spreading my worst experience with them.",1

The original ticket price is Rs. 28785 in all websites like EASEMYTRIP OR GOIBIBO and this fellow charged me Rs. 32, 750.

313,"I am writing to express my dissatisfaction regarding my recent booking through your platform. My booking number is NH76215247550470 and I had booked a hotel for a two-day stay. Unfortunately, due to some unforeseen circumstances and poor serviceby hotel, I had to cut my stay short by one day and had informed the hotel staff about it. The hotel staff assured me that they would process the refund for the one-day stay and asked me to contact Make My Trip customer service for the same. However, upon contacting your customer service team, I was informed that the refund for the one-day stay is not possible as per the hotel's cancellation policy. I am disappointed by this response as the hotel staff had assured me that the refund would be processed. I understand that cancellation policies are in place to protect the interests of both the hotel and the customers, but in this case, I had informed the hotel staff about my early departure and they had agreed to process the refund. It is unfair that I am now being denied the refund. I would like to request you to look into this matter and process the refund for the one-day stay as promised by the hotel staff. I believe that it is only fair that I receive a refund for the day that I did not stay at the hotel. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

One of the room was given wrong key. Out of 2 rooms booked one room had broken external lock and other had broken internal lock. The 2nd room was not having toilet flush. Moreover when asked the hotel didnt had right person to address the issue. MMT call agent conferenced in someone on phone but the person seem to be unaware of what is happening in the hotel. I also asked help with the call center agent to find an alternate hotel at my cost, but I was told that it was not possible, while I could get that done with a competitor for MMT. This is one of the worst experience that too while travelling with family including elderly members. The hotel DBR Suites doesnt seem to be the right hotel for families. It is meant for bachelors.

I will never ever book their services again as they don't take any responsibility and just give irresponsible response even after taking advance payment. If ur am lucky then u will get good service else it will be the worst day..MMT is Make Me Tensed not Make my Trip. I will make sure I file a complaint in consumer court for the worst experience i had with their cab service. -Anand,1

346,"I'm writing this review in the humblest way possible despite the nightmare MMT has shown us during Our Andaman trip. We were a group of 20 with 10 adults and 10 kids, and so we had relied upon a tour service provider that has a global footprint. To our great surprise and distress we now believe local tour operators are far better at providing quality services and packages when compared to the so called #1 travel provider.  As a group travelling with young kids, we expected not to have any kind of hiccups, but we were welcomed with quite a few challenges all through the trip. For the 6-day trip we booked and stayed at 3 hotels, all being 4-star. Nevertheless, every hotel had AC issues in one or the other room, and despite clearly mentioning with MMT that we are booking for family of 4 members, and need extra beds and paid for the same. However, we had to fight and argue at each and every hotel, only then we could get an extra bed. This shows clear negligence and lack of communication between the hotels and MMT. At Hotel SILVER SANDS, HAVELOCK ISLAND, we literally had to argue till late night 1 am to get a decent room for a family, because the room which we were given had major AC issues. Imagine in peak summer(mid of MARCH) in ANDAMAN without an AC along with young kids! Though there were one or two genuine supervisors/ managers who managed to arrange a backup room for us, we had to carry our sleepy kids and whole lot of luggage in the middle of the night, which was highly troublesome. Paying a whooping amount for a single night and not getting minimum comfort in the room was truly not acceptable whatever it is! We were served stale food items as well at Silver Sands, due to which kids had to drop out from breakfast, which was supposedly complimentary in the package offered by MMT. Even after choosing A-la-carte menu, the dinner had quality issues, which was agreed by the Restaurant Manager and the Head Chef themselves, and so we had to go out for dinner at 10 pm in the night! Now, coming to our travel agents, I don’t say all are being unprofessional, but we were unfortunate to encounter with one such agent during our Day 4 at Neil Island. We were assigned to MMT’s travel agent named AFROZ, who right from the beginning was quite rude. We however just ignored and started our trip at Neil Island, and after we reached Laxmanpur Beach in the evening at around 6 pm, we found the travel agent there and questioned him about non-working condition of ACs in the hotel rooms and some other people’s luggage being placed in the seats of the vehicle in which we were travelling. To this he surprisingly reacted violently, and upon his call, we were mobbed by some around 50 odd locales who started to push the men in our group, and even threatened us that none of the cabs/vans would come and pick us up from Laxmanpur beach, which was around 4-5 kms from our resort. Watching their dads being mobbed and pushed, our kids were literally scared and started to cry, which was the last thing we expected on our holiday. ? The guy used such filthy language and harsh words to us, which shows his unprofessional behavior towards the clients. When MMT can’t train its agents properly, at least start writing down disclaimers regarding such rude and ill-mannered employees, which would at least send an alert to people while booking itself. Amidst such bad experiences, we however managed to gather some good memories not because of the travel provider, but as I earlier said because of a few mangers/supervisors who have gone beyond their limits and have given best service. One such special mention goes to Mr. Sujay Singh, manager AQUAYS BEACH RESORTS, NEIL ISLAND, who arranged a beautiful Candle Night dinner for us, and lit up our very pathetic day on the Island. He specially curated the menu and made sure that we were served the best tasting food right from the starters to their special AQUAYS Biryani. Even though we had AC issues during check-in time, he was quick enough in resolving the issue before we reached the hotel in the evening after our day trip. Such personals are laudable and keep the spirit of service and holidaying intact for travelers. On the whole, this review is just to send an alert to travelers thinking of booking via MMT. Please just don’t go by the number of ratings, think twice before you book!",1
347,"I strongly urge people to NEVER EVER use MMT for any visa applications. I experienced tremendous hassles and delay and moreover no means of getting in touch with MMT to check status. WORST PART WAS CUSTOMER SERVICE. In stead of settling my grievance and issuing refund, their office in Gurgaon has people like Mr Dushyant and even later Mr, Ram who simply stopped responding to my emails and asking for the visa that I secured last minute through an agent. If MMT had processed visa, shouldnt they have their very own details. Even after sending them my visa, there is absolutely no response on refund. I am deeply diappointed that I, being an elite MMT customer for years was treated this way. I am going to stop using MMT completely and urge everyone to never ever use their visa services. They should simply shut down this service when they dont seem to have the right people capable of doing a good job.",5

In the balcony , there was a bra, apart of undies and some other cloth - belongs to neighbours, I was told but nobody bothered to remove these. Outside 10 metre from my window a temple - I was told the bells only chime and they pray for 15 mins....at 4 AM, yes 4 am. That was the last straw. The hotel refused to change the room or give a refund and Makemytrip offered me one night reimbursement instead of the two reserved and paid for declining any responsibility for putting a misleading and and misselling. A few hours later the same room was put up by Agoda for half the rate. Avoid Makemytrip and you won't trip. Avoid Hotel Exotic as they are a bunch of incompetent and dishonest hoteliers.

361,"I had one trip to Agra and Rajasthan booked through MakeMyTrip and I had the worst travel experience till date - 1) I was told drivers in the North have a habbit of chewing gutakha and I should not have any objection to it. They also use bad words and shout and that too should be ok. 2) For taxi, I was charged Rs.8500 per day. When I went there, I asked 3-4 drivers and they said max charges are Rs. 5000 to Rs 5500 per day. Drivers were from different states, but they had this rate common. So, this was a big loot by MakeMyTrip. 3) I was given a link for feedback when I was traveling. When I checked it after I was back, the link was being shown as expired. I asked about it, but I was told that there is no option. Instead, I will have to send an email. This must have been to avoid negative feedback shown on their site. 4) About hotel cleanliness - there was nothing which can be called as clean in Vrindavan and Udaipur hotels. I sent photos to the MakeMyTrip office what's app account, but there was no action taken. There was not even a reply. 5) Even when there was no cleanliness, charges of the hotels were exorbitant. I was told year end is peak season and hence the charges.~Rs 6000 to Rs 7000 per day for those hotels given to me is beyond any logic. 6) I had to submit taxi bill in my office for LTA and when asked for the same, I was denied the bill saying we do not give bills with split charges for hotels, taxi etc. I could not submit the bills and had to pay extra tax. I would recommend everyone to stay away from MakeMyTrip and book your own hotels and taxi. These guys are good for nothing.",1

366,"In Oct 2015 we made this trip to Rajasthan where the driver was of zero help with regards to location and places though he was a local there. He seemed more like he was doing us a favour and seemed upset and annoyed if we didnt eat from the restaurants he suggested. This is one thing you should be vary of in Rajasthan. Most so called tour guides get commission from handicraft stores, restaurants etc which I am not totally against but it's not something you can enforce on tourists. It's our choice where we want to spend our money. Other than that the trip was uneventful. In 2016, Arunachal tour, bookings were made via MMT. The travel agent was one Miss Baljeet Chauhan from their Mumbai office. The entire itinerary was provided to her by me. All she had to do was make the hotel and travel arrangements. Hotels in AP are very cheap and we had agreed upon what kind of room we wanted. We found on arrival there that on the first day we were served just bread, butter and tea for breakfast because the chef was absent. She could have just skipped the meal charges and we could have chosen what we wanted ourselves and paid for it then and there but no, she wanted a commission even out of that. The next day we were accommodated in some dingy room which then made us suspicious and on enquiring with the hotel manager and local travel agent we realised that she had forwarded a completely different room category to the local agents. I had to get her on the phone, give her an earful and demand that my next room category be upgraded as a compensation. After that if I ever tried contacting the MMT office, they had very cold responses to everything once they knew who the caller was. Never heard from that cheat of a female again. Not just that we were fleeced even with regards to our vehicle arrangements. Never have two intermediate travel agents. These MMT ppl give the contract to some local travel agent in the north east and they in turn make your arrangements. You might as well contact them directly. The only thing is when it's a travel agent in your city, you know whom to haul up if things go south, so be careful where and how you decide to pay. My experience with MMT. Never booked with them again.",1

I wanted to take my mother on yatra, how would she cope with such crazy timing- from 7 am it became to 5 am and then 4 am, all in a week's time, the return ticket was direct that changed to 4hrs waiting. I finally had to cancel the trip and lose 21K as a cancellation fee. I request cum caution everyone to never ever book anything through them, please!",1
371,Never lock price on makemytrip. I had 3 different bookings of same flight to which one booking they cancelled without even informing me. The validy of lock price was still there for 2 days. The reason which the executive gave was the seats must have got full. But when i checked from a different account for the same flight. The price was increased and half of the aircraft was empty. I had to pay 10000 extra for the tickets. Also when i went for the 2nd lock price booking it is not allowing me to complete my booking and a message pops up saying multiple attempts please try after 30min. I never did multiple attempts for the payment. This is really disgusting. Makemytrip is fake. It should shut down for robbing people,4
372,"I had booked a 6 day trip to Sikkim & Darjeeling  for me, my wife and my son(from 1st Dec 2022 to 6th Dec 2022) using makemytrip services. At the time of booking, makemytrip staff Ayesha suggested me to take up Interest free EMI(6 months EMI) . I was not interested in this & told her that I intend to pay 100% at one go. But as she insisted that I do not have to pay any interest & makemytrip will take care of that, I said fine. Then she suggested certain credit cards & I selected one of them that I already had & before making the payment I again asked her reconfirmation on interest free EMI, she said yes, bank will not charge any interest on the EMI payments from customer & thats me. As I had difficulties while making on line payment, she only processed and shared the link to make the payment & I accordingly did it. We completed the trip and after a week I got my credit card statement and was shocked to see that the bank had charged processing fee along with Interest Plus GST on the interest for the first month EMI. Then through whats app contacted Ayesha of makemytrip and she raised a service request with her help and she confirmed that the issue will be resolved. But to my shock makemytrip closed the issue without resolving and without refunding me the processing fee, Interest, GST on interest which for 6 months comes to nearly Rs. 7, 000.00. I even shared my first & 2nd month credit card statement to Ayesha to prove that i'm paying interest, processing fee, GST on the interest. But unfortunately irresponsible makemytrip executives stopped answering my calls and my whats app messages. I'm a director in a multinational company & if makemytrip staff have got the audacity to cheat & igonore my complaints, I do not know how much common citizens will suffer. I demand a compensation of Rs. 25, 000.00 from makemytrip for causing loss of my time, innumerable follow ups with makemytrip, mental torture & I demand makemytrip never to mislead its customers in future.

373,"Confirmed Booking NH72078245459234 I made a confirmed hotel booking 5 days in advance using MMT portal for 4 family members and 3 small kids(under aged 7), 2 rooms in Hotel Shagun Palace, Manasa, MP, however, upon reaching to hotel at around 10PM in the night after a long train journey, they denied giving rooms simply saying they didn't receive any info form MMT. They refused to give rooms even for upfront cash booking saying their property is full. Upon calling MMT, they simply said ""SORRY' and offered me a full refund or another booking in a nearby town which was 35km far! SERIOUSLY! I had my old-aged parents with me, ladies and small kids, all tired and exhausted. I had to travel with my family in 2 autorickshaws(even taxi wasn't available in such a small town) in cold night, roaming around a small town I had never been before, looking for a decent hotel, just to eventually settle around midnight in a lodge with almost no amenities, as it was way too late for the kids. This was literally an immensely painful experience for me and my family, just because of MMT's irresponsible behavior. I have all the voice call recordings with me and also have lodged a complaint on consumer grievance portal docket number 4305092. I won't cut them loose so easily even if I had to fight in consumer court for 1-2 years. I would request all people out there to use a better service provider, AVOID MMT at all costs.

383,Tour reference: NL2100153619930 I am very much disappointed by MMT's response when I informed them that the hotel given to me were not of 4Star category ( it was 3 star or even lower category) whereas i paid for 4star. I had given evidences to MMTteam about thehotel not of 4star category and they just denied the request ruthlessly without even having curtsey to have a phone call withme to understand the problem. Hope MMT team will improve in communication with client before selling the package. Sandeep Vichare,1
384,"I booked 4 tickets in 6E-6594 flight for May 2023. Before booking, there was a pop-up stating that if the ticket was cancelled 3 days before the flight's departure, the customer would receive a full refund. After booking I get to know, I will get only 500/- out of 13769/- I paid, if I cancel the ticket after 24 hours of booking. This appears to be a SCAM! I will not recommend make my trip for personal travel unless the travel plan/date is completely confirmed. Otherwise, you will lose 97% of your ticket booking amount.",1

We used outstation cab booking service and this was our experience: We had to stop mid way and send driver off although it meant being stranded in a small town (Chenglepet) Driver was coughing and had a cold and refused to wear a mask, in spite of me providing one He was talking on the phone and driving, holding phone in one hand Refused to reduce sound on the radio when requested Car front seat did not have a working seat belt Bad driving skills and inexperienced driver Did not know the way even to tambaram railway station Bad attitude of driver, not listening to any client instructions Stopped at gas station and wasted 30 minutes as he didn't have cash and had to contact someone to transfer by Google pay etc!!! Unsanitised car! No stand for GPS tracking so he has phone on his lap and kept looking at road and lap! None of the promises delivered!! And yet Make my trip chose to believe the driver and vendor that none of this is true. Why would we send car away after paying in full if none of this is true??",3

389,"I'm writing this review after being let down more than once. I don't usually give bad reviews even if the service provided is below satisfactory. But after facing so many issues with booking through makemytrip.com, I really wanted to make sure if this helps someone avoid being harassed by such bookings. Please use some alternate platform, makemytrip has lost its quality. Be it cab booking, hotel booking or any other service they claim to provide, there are so many loopholes. you can never be sure if the booking you made is actually available at the hotel or not, even if they say your booking is confirmed and you don't need to contact the hotel. Trust me, re-confirm your booking with the hotel staff. Also, their customer care is a nightmare. you never know how to reach whom to contact. If by any chance your booking is not reflecting in your account, there is no way you can contact them for that. the least they would do is, tell you that you will get a refund in 12-14 days. what are you supposed to do in that time? is there a chance the booking will start reflecting in your account, do you need to re-book, or will it be refunded if the amount gets confirmed later on. How are you supposed to plan a trip with so many uncertainties. So so disappointed with this.",1
390,"Hello MakeMyTrip, I am trying to connect to your customer support and helpline number for the refund of 1 ticket booking which been automatically cancelled with any technical glitch. No body is responding on the same and just passing the numbers. Kindly connect me as soon as possible.",1
391,What a worst service. We booked a ticket for the 12th of Feb. And as the page redirected the date changed to the 9th of march. And the cancellation charges are half of the ticket amount. The feedback system on the application doesn't work well. We have to search for other websites for contacts and feedbacks.,1
392,"Background: I did a reservation for a hotel(Lemon Tree Premier, Aerocity, New Delhi) for a night stay however the first transaction got failed and then I reinitiated the payment and then the transaction was successful. Issue: The first transaction was failed even though Makemytrip was able to take the money from my account and I end up having 2 bookings on same day at same hotel.  So, I called the customer service and requested to cancel the first booking as I got the message of transaction failure which end up in having a duplicate reservations. Result: I called to customer service 14 times and I have to tell the background to each of the agent on each call(this was very very frustrating). THEY DON'T HAVE A LOGGING SYSTEM/SOFTWARE. They will put me on hold saying that they are connecting to Lemon Tree hotel and will get back after they will have word with the hotel people. Scam: They(Make my trip agents) will say that no one picked the call at Lemon Tree Hotel so they will try again after some time and will revert back once they will hear from hotel. But no one will call to the hotel and no one will ever call me. They will say that they sent an email to the hotel and are awaiting response. When I spoke to hotel they told that they will speak to Makemytrip and not to me as I booked through makemytrip. So, I don't know in the backend that actually makemytrip is doing something to get the money back or they actually cheated me. I had to travel back to my country and they sent me an email that the agent was not able to connect with me so they closed my ticket. They have script for all the different scenarios and they are very well planned scammers/thief. They know how to steal money from hard working people. They scammed/stole 300 dollars from me and I don't want this should happen to anyone else. PLEASE DO NOT USE THEM FOR ANY BOOKING SERVICE.",1

402,"Mouth shut increased rating of My trip by 1 star. It's only 2 stars. My first ever trip to Rajasthan, booked via makemytrip portal, was a bad decision. It's expensive, they will book hotels which are 4 stars (makemytrip) rating but in reality they are 3 stars or 2. So they will charge more and give less. Also rooms booked will not inude any location preference whatsoever, they will not mention all this. One such experience was in Udaipur hotel Rajdarshan, where I got back view of hotel, rather than lake view and i wasn't even informed about the options. Same happened in Udaipur where hotel ventilation was very very poor, no windows to open, this was Hotel chandra imperial. Now I am in Jaisalmer, sunrise dessert tent, rated 4 star but it deserves only 2 star. Their rooms are not clean, bedsheets are dirty, ordered tea, and tea pot was as dirty. I had to ask for soap, towels etc. I paid 50k to makemytrip which includes 2 nights at Udaipur, 1 night in Jodhpur and 2 nights in Jaisalmer, including city transfers. But dont be fooled, it looks good on paper, in reality it's real expensive and not worth. My advice please plan your own trip and get good deals straight my hotels. Save your money for shopping. I am going to post detailed review about hotel experience.",3

404,"Team @ make my trip We had planned our trip to Vietnam with your representative Ms. Jyotsana. Our trip could have been much better if she was little wise and active. The itenary planned was not discussed with us , neither the special place like halong bay in Hanoi; bana hills in Danaang and Mekong delta in Ho Chi Minh were brought to our notice . Which are must visit places . On the contrary , palaces and museum’s, mail  and post office were added in city tours  just to fill the day . She was not at all proactive to provide us with basics like hotel vouchers, detailed itenary, insurance policies and much more . In fact on asking her she would reply “ will check “ and get in mute mode . Again on follow up she would revert with half answers. Such a lame response from MMT executive is not acceptable. Even the contact details provided by her was not correct, the number had incoming calls barred . Person going abroad if doesn’t have such things handy and appropriate then feels helpless and exactly we felt the same because of lack of Jyotsana’s approach. Hotels did not serve food , this is basic necessity which was not checked and informed by Jyotsana. Moreover, the country was celebrating lunar new year due to which many places were closed and even food was not delivered in lieu of new year . All the markets were closed . A trip advisor should be proactive enough to know this and inform the client but your representative is sadly quite dumb. In hochi Minh city a room with 1 double bed was booked while we were 3 adults and was very difficult to accommodate. On raising the concern Jyotsana again with careless attitude replied the next day without any solution. This kind of lethargic approach from MMT officer is disappointing. Really upset with the kind of management offered by MMT team . Expect the refund of my amount paid as was not at all worth with the itenary planned and the same was provided on the last moment after following up with her numerous times . Unpleasant experience with MMT , it’s a fraud of galloping money with such rubbish ITENARY. Regards, Neha",1

I have been trying to contact your team to get this sorted but all they do is to ignore the call and tell this issue will be sorted. I have given all the required documents but still they haven’t sorted this issue. Everythime I raise a ticket , they mark it as closed .

408,"I booked an interstate cab via MMT and made full advance payment for the journey for a RYDE assured AC Sedan cab from Manali to Chandigarh railway station for 21st Jan, 2023. My pick-up time was scheduled for 6'0 clock in the morning but it came late by 1.15 hour i.e, by approx 7.15 AM and the cab is different from the cab details which we were provided by the MMT was not arrived. When we tracked the location of the vehicle by the GPS TRACKER service which is provided in the MMT app, the vehicle location found to be in Chandigarh but the cab booked for Manali to Chandigarh hence it shows that the cab was not present in manali for the pick-up, that means a complete fraud has occurred by MMT Group. We received a hatchback car which is so compact and in a very bad condition and the driver was so rude and tried to threatened us in between our journey that he will stop the cab and leave us in between our journey. The driver stopped the car in between and asked us to pay for the journey, when I told him that I already paid it to MMT in advance he refused to move forward and stop the vehicle in between the journey. As it is assured by MMT that RYDE ASSURED CABS consists of audited clean cabs, monitored on time pickups, trained and helpful drivers for which they have charged us more as compared to a regular cab booking. My mother was so exhausted in the whole journey and fall sick because of the kiosk that happened with the driver and the compactness of the car as our whole luggage was kept inside the car. We were forced to literally adjust the suitcase on our laps. And when I asked for refunding the whole amount I was told that I will get a callback from their supervisor in the next 2-3 hrs but didn't get any call. Today I got a call and mail from Suraj Thapa( MMT Customer service staff) regarding the refund of only Rs 2511 but i booked it for Rs 7081. It is the fault of MMT for what we have caused in our journey so that has to be bear by MMT group only.. I am having all the audio and video recordings of inside the cab how we travelled in our whole 8hrs journey in that compact car. As well as the screenshot of location of the vehicle that has allotted to us for the journey. I want the complete refund of my booking and the compensation also for the cause what we suffered in the whole journey by the MMT company.

I took an auto and reached the location mentioned in the MMT app. To my wonder, there was no such hotel in that location. After enquiring with a couple of localities, I found that the hotel was closed 2 years ago. I called MMT for help. I was on a call with MMT till night at 11:50 PM asking them to book another hotel. It was hell standing on the unknown streets for almost 4 hours and the final response I got from the MMT team was ""Sir, please go for an offline booking, we will pay you the extra difference. amount."" At night 11:50 these people are expecting me to go street by street and find a hotel. My phone was dead by that time, so I hired an auto and started knocking on every hotel on the streets. At 1:30 AM I found a third-class hotel asking 3 times more price than what generally they charge for a single room. I had no options, I paid and stayed there. The story does not end here. Its been more than 12 days now, and I still did not receive my refund amount. After every 2 days, I call Customer service, I have to repeat the entire story of what happened on that night and then they will put me on hold for hours together and so on. I wasted around 10 hours so far just to get my refund amount.",2
427,"I have been using Makemytrip majorly since May 2018 when I joined a company where I had to travel a lot. And in these 4 plus years of usage, I felt among all services that they provide only the Flight ticket booking service is good. Apart from Flight Ticket service Makemytrip also provides booking services for the listed below: > Hotels > Trains > Holiday Packages > Airport Cab > Home Stays > Outstation Cab > Travel Insurance > Gift Card > Hourly Stay etc. In the above list, I have used booking services for Hotels, Airport Cab, and Outstation Cab. Their Hotel booking service is not the best, the majority of the time the rooms booked on the app/website is not allotted on arrival at the hotel. The customer support service sucks and reaching them when we are facing the actual issues is next to impossible. I remember an incident that has taken place in February 2019 when we visited Ludhiana after traveling from Hyderabad to Chandigarh by flight and then by cab from Chandigarh to Ludhiana. I and my colleague were dead tired. We reached the Hotel late in the evening, we had a booking in a Hotel by the name of ""Hotel Neelkanth"". We have booked a double bed AC room in that Hotel(i.e. with two single beds). When we were taken to the rooms it was firstly non AC and secondly, there was a single double bed. The Hotel informed us that the room that we are supposed to get was not vacated by the earlier guests as they have extended their stay. That was wintertime in Punjab and the weather was chilling outside. We tried contacting Makemytrip customer service and were able to connect with them after half an hour. It took MakeMyTrip 3 hours to resolve the issue with the Hotel. But that time duration of 4 hours(approximately) was irritating. And all Makemytrip told us was just a SORRY. The Hotel was good and we stayed there for 10 days. I have taken an Airport cab service once from Makemytrip and the experience was a nightmare for me. I took their cab service from Madurai Airport to Kodaikanal in the first week of March 2020. The journey shouldn't take more than 3 hours and 30 minutes. But the allotted driver first took us to some other place(relatives/client's residence) where he wanted to deliver some papers. Then on the way, the driver stopped for having lunch, extending our journey time and making it 5 hours. After that day I never booked an Airport cab from the Makemytrip app/website again. I once booked an outstation cab from Patiala to Ludhiana using Makemytrip. Firstly the driver came to the pickup point 2 hours late and the Makemytrip Customer Support team was unable to provide an alternating cab during that duration of 2 hours. The driver opted for a different route making the journey discomforting(as the road was constructed, a typical village road) and lengthy. And all the Makemytrip team could tell is SORRY. Hence apart from Flight Ticket booking, I won't suggest Makemytrip for any other service, that too use the service when Makemytrip is giving cheap tickets compared to its other competitors.",1

434,Absolute garbage. I booked an interstate cab via MMT and made full advance payment for the journey. Tried calling the driver and customer helpline number multiple times at the pickup time but did not get any response from either. In the end had to get a local cab on my own. And when I asked for refunding the amount I was told that I will get a callback from service agent's manager in the next 2-4 hrs. It has been 2 days since then and I just received a mail that my complaint has been closed now,1
435,"Planned a vacation for our family and approached Makemytrip(MMT) to customize a trip for 6 days, and 5 nights to Rajasthan, viz Udaipur, Jodhpur, and Jaisalmer. MMT charged close to Rs.41000 per head for air-fare to and from Rajasthan(Kolkata-New Delhi-Udaipur and Jodhpur-Kolkata respectively), hotel stay for 5 nights, and transportation by a MUV. From the outset, when we reached Udaipur airport, our ordeal started. The vehicle that was supposed to take us to the hotel was not present and the transport agency fixed by MMT was either clueless or had assigned the car to someone else for making a quick buck. Ultimately a car was sent to us after half an hour of wait with my family in the sun, the driver was not briefed properly, he did not know the route to the hotel and flatly told me that he was just supposed to drop us at the hotel and was not aware of any future program as detailed in our itinerary, The next two days it was a constant pressure situation as I had to call up the transporter multiple times to get hold of a vehicle. I was kept on tenterhooks so much so that I had to miss out on the site seeing of a few places in Udaipur. I was assigned and assured that the hotels that had been booked for us were all three-star properties. Now I don’t know what MMT means by the term 3 stars. Either they have very poor perceptions or they are making money by fooling customers. All these so-called “3 STAR” hotels had stinking toilets, broken doors(that did not lock properly), and TVs’ that did not work. One hotel had the same set of batteries for the remote and the AC, and one was expected to interchange them while using the particular remote. At Jodhpur, the hotel was such that a car could not drive up to its door. We were off-loaded on the road and had to wheel our luggage for almost 800 meters and then lug them up ourselves over steep stairs(no lift available). Here also the bathroom had leaky faucets that had water dripping through the night. The last hotel at Jaisalmer was where one would be scared to step out of the hotel, such a remote locality. Here too the rooms and bathrooms were far from average(the cockroaches were 3-star alright). The basin was broken and again no lift. So much for an Rs.1.63 lakh package for 5 nights by MMT. My booking Id NL2102123296144. I should also mention that the very formal MMT staff on the helpline were clueless in most cases when I raised the issue. In one case the support staff did not know who the travel agent assigned by MMT was and I had to guide him. In between my complaints, MMT offered me a gift voucher of Rs.3000 with conditions attached of course. Through this post, I would like to tell MMT that a vacation is not only about money and coupons. It is a moment in our lives that won’t come back and a messed up vacation leaves a bad taste in the mouth that a gift coupon will not heal. Missed opportunities that we suffered due to inefficient trip management are something for which MMT cannot be forgiven.",1

I had specifically asked the trip planner Ms. Lohia to centre the trip around my 5 year old daughter, so that she can have the most of it. Flight- They booked me in a godforsaken airline, Batik Air, where you had to pay for glass of water as well. Stay- I went along with what the trip planner suggested, that I should be having experience of various locations while you are there, so that you can get to make various memories. While she was suggesting this, I kept one precondition that the properties should be 4 stars and above and those properties should have their pvt. beach. I stayed in Holiday inn resort for initial 3 nights-days, though the place is decent, clean but the private beach which I was promised was shut because of some construction activity going on at the  beach site. Couldn't she have done her homework before even suggesting. Never mind, the second property was a site straight out of Ramsay movie ""Purani Haveli"", I am not exaggerating, it was totally dilapidated, whit muck on the ceiling, lizards in the room and dirty swimming pool. And the kicker was that, this property doesn't have inhouse dining facility. When I whatsapped the advisor, she had the audacity to reply that ""most travelers dine outside"" WOW.

479,"Attachments 10:37 AM(51 minutes ago) to service, rajesh.magow, servicesupport Dear Krishna, Thanks for your mail. First of all, I would like to inform you that no one has reached me from MMT and everytime you guys just copied and pasted the email without reading the emails. I'm really disappointed with the MMT from the last 4 months. I have been chasing MMT for my refund but getting emails for the acknowledgement. no one is helping me for a refund or able to address my queries. If you don't have a refund then please don't disturb me again and again by sending emails. @MMT is worst services, I have never suggest or advise anyone to book tickets from MMT, I am a corporate employee and have been waiting a long time for my refund and I knew about this I didn't get my refund from your company In-addition; I have attached a communication email from your representative.",1
480,"On 2nd October I searched a Delhi - Zurich flight on makemytrip.com. The website showed me an option of price-lock and suggested that I can the pay Rs 27625 to lock my ticket at current price which was shown as Rs 70000 approx per pax equivalent to around Rs 3, 50, 000/-. The benefit shown was that my price will not increase and I will get benefit of price drop if any. To my horror after paying Rs 27625/- through my American Express credit card I got an email that my price is locked at Rs 3, 94, 650/- and I have to pay an extra Rs 3, 94, 650/- to complete the booking(ID NN73TJMKLEBKCZ2W5823) On calling the customer service they told that they are a third party service and they are in no control of the process. They informed that I should be extra careful in dealing with online services and there is no way in which they or I can connect with makemytrip. Finally on persisting the agent confirmed that sometimes the fare changes between booking and payment and such technical errors happen. She also assured that my price lock amount will get adjusted in the final payment. She confirmed that since a senior who will handle this is not available she would request a call back and assured that the same would be happen within 24 hours. Since the price lock is valid for only 7 days and I did not receive any call for 4 days, on evening of 5th October I again called makemytrip. The agent again said there is absolutely nothing that she can do and clarified that Rs 27, 625 will not be adjusted against any booking amount. It is normal for all travel agents to hold flight fares for 48 hours. Makemytrip is scamming people by showing misleading messages and then retaining that money without giving service in return. In my case they took Rs 27, 625 as an advance and refused to adjust it in the ticket price later.",1
481,"Very very worst experience with make my trip.. They showed good pics in online, when it come to reality the hotels, rooms and tempo also the very worstttt..",1
482,"There is no option to give 0 star. MMT has the worst customer service ever, I called like 100 times to reschedule my flight, first they tell me its non changeable when I book a flexible ticket then you hung up and call back again the agent gave me difference of 12k! Bro I could find a new flight within that amount. seems like you're stuck once you book the flight with them. Never book with them again",1
483,"Day by day, MMT is graduating from bad to worse. I used MMT for booking my stay at Residence Inn Marriot in Phoenix AZ, I got confirmation for the booking so I flew to phoenix considering that I have a place to stay, once I reached the property I asked for the room, to my surprise Hotel said that my booking was cancelled by my provider(i.e. MMT). I was shocked because I was in a different country and I don’t even know the place and I don’t have a place to stay(you can imagine the ordeal). I asked Hotel for a reason why the booking was cancelled and they suggested that they don’t have a reason because it was done by the portal that I booked the hotel and only option I have is to check with them. It was 15th Sep around 4:00 PM local time and my disaster started from here, I called MMT customer service(1-800-463-4210), I spoke to Vikash on the first call, he took all my details and asked to wait for 30 minutes and assured me that someone from their relevant team will call me back at my US number and provide resolution. I waited for almost an hour standing outside the hotel but never got a call, I called them again this time I spoke to Rajat, He again took all the details and said he do not have any information what happened previously and he will make sure I get a call back from team concerned in next 15-20 minutes. I again waited for almost 40 minutes, no call was received, I called again and spoke to Rahul (for that matter I realized they have 3 different Rahul’s) and he immediately understood my concern and suggested me to wait for another 30 minutes and also promised me that he will call me back in 30 minutes to check if I got a call or not, I was a fool to trust them, neither of them called. I reached out to MMTC again and spoke to Sujit, he said nothing is in his hand and has to have a team concerned call me back, I suggested if he can transfer the call because its been 3 hours and I have been standing on the road with luggage and no where to go but he did not listen and kept saying he doesn’t have any means to get me connect to anyone. I thought I will give one more try(I didn’t have a choice I was at MMTC mercy), I agreed to another fake promise of a callback, meanwhile, I started checking nearby hotel availability because by this time I was sure MMTC will not call me back(exactly what happened). I tried to find in available properties at around 8 evening, To my utter shock & disbelief there was no availability for 15th Sep night, I was left stranded on the road in a different country and no other place to go. The place also didn’t look secured, My phone’s battery was almost dying and I had no place to go. I went to a café nearby with all my luggage and no place to stay and charged my phone and tried to call MMTC again, what a pain, I spoke to Vikash now and he said exactly the same thing, he will escalate and get me a call in 30 minutes, I requested him and pleaded him that I have been waiting for almost 5 hours already, he said he doesn’t have any information from my previous conversation and has to treat it as a new case, he assured me that he himself will call me in 30 minutes to check if I got a call or not. I had no choice except to wait, meanwhile, because it was getting way too late, I had to take up an accommodation which costed me more than$200 per night. I anticipated that I will get a call from MMTC but I never did, I kept calling them after every hour and spoke to a different person and was been promised a call in 10-15 minutes because everyone highlighted the case on priority. It is strange that they don’t have authority and they never have a supervisor to talk to on the floor. Every time I asked for a supervisor I got exactly same answer that supervisor is not available, I was promised supervisor call as well but I never received, meanwhile, I got an email from MMTC stating that they tried to reach out to me, I immediately replied to them but never got a revert and I have replied to that email 7 times already in last 2 days but yet to get any response, email is from Mou Sarkar. I am seriously disappointed by the kind of services I received from MMTC and has left a bitter taste in mouth and will never use the services again and make sure I let my network know what really happened. I am sure this review also will fall into deaf ears but I am going to share my views wherever I can.",1
484,"I'm giving one start because there is no option to give 0 stars. I was trying to cancel the booking. The site says there is a cancellation charge in fact the cancellation charge is more than the actual charge. So you won't get anything. Cheater, Cheater Cheater.",1
485,"This company is full of scammers, fraudsters. This company should be banned by govt. They are openly doing scam with travellers. They are money greedy snakes. Guys dont fall into their trap. Better ti search some another platform.",1
486,Horrible experience with MMT. Booked a one way cab which was cancelled the night before departure by the vendor because they said the cab had broken down. The person who called asked me to cancel my booking and make a fresh booking. By this time the fare had increased by 1500 rs.I tried calling the number back but there was no response. Then I called Make My Trip Customer Service but they said it was a' fraud call'despite the fact that i sent them a screenshot of the call i had received and the numerous attempts from my side to call back. Had to make other last minute arrangements . Nightmare! Never again.,1
487,"Booked a Boulevard Design Hotel, Chennai through make my trip 24 hours in advance . Make my Trip charged me full and issued me with a voucher and confirmed me the booking. Upon reaching the hotel for check-in, the reception guy said they haven’t got the confirmation from Make my trip and all the rooms were booked. When contacted make my trip the executive disconnected my call knowing the blunder. To put simply the MMT is a fake guys and charging the customers first without even knowing the hotel has a room or not. They must be punished for all such illegal money transactions from the customers. Worst experience with Make My Trip.",1
488,"Day by day, MMT is graduating from bad to worse I used MMT for booking my stay at a beach house in Kannur Kannur not being a tourist centric town, I chose the best accommodation in the best available property for a 2 nights’ stay The property is in a village & after reading the description and facilities,  I was quite surprised that such a place can exist in a small village in Kannur. I even confirmed the details by talking over the phone with MMT support & the property owner. To my utter shock & disbelief, out of 28 promised facilities, 20 were absent, 2 I didn’t require. Most importantly, there was no security, neither for the guests(any outsider could come & go at their own free will), nor for the law enforcement(Our IDs were not checked, any person can stay claiming someone else’s identity). The accommodation was filthy, broken floors & full of jumbo sized cockroaches. And when these were brought to the notice of MMT, the response came that they will resolve this by 48 hours, i.e. 24 hours beyond my stay at the property. Finally, their resolution was to issue a voucher to me with a definite expiry period. It means, for the resolution to be effective, I would need to avail the MMT services again Once beaten, twice shy. NEVER AGAIN",1

490,Worst customer service ever. Haven't seen a brand such irresponsible and inefficient. Our international flight got cancelled and MMT isn't providing any solution for the last 5 weeks. Kept on false promising and left us stranded,1
491,"Rooms not cleaned properly, poor food quality, careless staff, stinky hotel lobby, experience was worst ever...",3
492,"Stay in IBIS OMR is the worst, the services rendered is hopeless and useless. The quality of accommodation is worst than a local hotel with such a brand name. If any needs backache can pay money to get that in this hotel absolutely free free.....the quality of bed is the worst already there is lot of undulating surfaces which is visible. The management done by the front office and Manager Mr.Kixxx is worst.He couldn't able to solve even an GST invoice and made my checkout after one hour of struggle.",1
493,"The MMT doesn't validate photos versus actual. They just rely on photos given by hotel itself. The customer service don't help but they tell they keep in engaging you in conversation for long time so that you loose on time I booked a hotel in mount abu through MMT. The hotel was completely different from photos. The rooms were dripping  hygiene, stinking. When I told this to MMT they said they are solving but they weren't doing anything. I paid 5.2k per night for the room and room wasn't even 1k worth. There was electric current in staircase. They didn't help me to change hotel neither they refunded. Very bad experience. Henceforth I would never book from MMT. #MMT #BAD EXPERIENCE",1
494,"My first ever trip was booked through MakemyTrip.com and it made me think how this company claims itself to be India's No.1 Travel company, What a shameful declaration. Whereas the reality is nowhere close. Entire staff includes their customer care executive, Travel Agents and all back-end support. All are absolutely useless, lousy and most unreliable people and available to ruin your travel experience. Having your tour booked through them is a wastage of your hard-earned money and valuable time. They are all fraud, take all the payment in advance and leave you to suffer at a hotel/resort at a place far away from the city. I had a miserable experience with them on my trip to Ranthambore, they took money to reserve my stay booking with a 4-Star property and when I reached the place Shani Vilas, it was not even a 2-Star property at Ranthambore(Rajasthan). Property was in pathetic condition, at the reception. There wasn't any staff to carry your luggage, we carried our luggage ourselves to the hotel room. When the door was opened, the room was stinking like hell. Door lock was damaged(we were not able to lock the room). Bedsheets/Bedcovers were spotty, no TV connection, dirty toilet pots, no WI-FI connection. No arrangement of hot water, no toiletries supplied, extremely dirty towels, ceiling lights were not working. Even after we requested to get it fixed, no one came to fix the faulty bulb. Very dirty swimming pool, toads were all swimming inside it, muddy surrounding, tasteless food. We made several calls and raised issue with MakeMyTrip(MMT) to change our hotel room, they took no action and simply stop hearing to our requests, stop responding to our calls and messages. I sent out all the pictures to Jyoti Singal(Trip coordinator) to show her the condition of the property, but of no use. No one even bothered to call back and listen to our concern from MMT. Atul from MMT was a rude employee, who instead of providing a resolution to our problems, started arguing with us and cancelled our booking at mid-night without informing us. The manager at hotel Shani Vilas, Ranthambore informed about the room cancellation and made us leave the hotel at the mid-night on a dark stormy and rainy day, my kid was also very sick at that time as we all were completely drenched during our Safari( it rained almost the entire day). This is how pathetic, terrible and heartless company MakeMyTrip is. Beware, as this is a usual practice for them to make false commitments to travellers and proclaim themselves to be India's No. 1. making money out of trapping innocent travellers.",1
495,Very poor  customer support asked from  last 15 days for refund neither  agent nor any senior person  come forward to resolve the issue,1
496,It was ridiculous services in hotel. I have a baby of 2 years old and requested many times for milk and they took 3 hours to provide milk. Apart of that the food was too bland and no taste in that. They provided check in very late. The AC of the room was not working even after complaint they did something but cooling was not there. Apart of that there was no alternate to provide other room as all are packed. TV did not have sound. They cut the line of landline due to which I needed to go personally to them for any service. They had less quantity of food according to the guests they had. We needed to wait so long for 1 chapati and it took 1 hour to complete our lunch. Why you registers such hotels in your list. I’ll never prefer to book anything on MMT.,1
497,Pathetic and unreliable service....they left my old parents all alone at raigad resort ... credibility issue....don't book with them...btr to hire local guy....after service also pathetic no sense of care...they left u alone and just cance the booking that too after 1 hr f schedule time...scam of taking badvance n cancelling if getting btr price anywhere,1

When I called on the day of check-in they said I need to speak to MakeMyTrip folks on this. I called MMT several and time they tried convincing and they did not agree. I did not stay in the hotel, but I lost 10K of my hard earned money without even visiting the place or the hotel. I hope both Hotel Palmyra Grand Suite & MMT is happy taking my money without providing any service.",1

503,Customer Care team not give proper response & they are just ignoring the customer and not give proper resolution and good hotel. They are using booking amount after cancellation and only said wait for 48 hrs and passing the days. After give hotel video then also they are not believing on customer. 5 days completed but they are not refund my amount and also not provided alternative property.,1
504,Online customer support is pathetic and act as robots to just say the line given without having a conversation. Beware of MMT they just fool customer and charge bomb but when it comes to addressing query after payment they will act as dumb.

Makemytrip did not compensate me at all for improper verification for cancellation.,1

I ended up loosing more than 40K. When I asked for clarification. She stopped responding. such a terrible and pathetic service. I tried raising tickets but they are getting closed without even having a word with me. Think before you choose to go for booking by MMT. Vouchers too were wrongly generated?,5

MMT trip director also confirmed that the trip’s cost is standard and cant go up.Moreover they charged full cost for my daughter who is below 15yrs however it’s always  a discounted ticket for below 15 yrs at Jungfraujoch, Switzerland .In total I was charged around 17-18k extra for 4 of us.when I tried to call trip coordinator on return she explained that in India we charge GST additionally but she had no answer for full ticket for my daughter  which they charged instead of a discounted one( 208 euros instead of 168 euros)…even if that is the case it is still around 12K extra charges …They charged me 82k as advance in India while tickets were bought on the spot for me for around 64-65 k Rs including discounted ticket for my daughter.I am carrying all the tickets with me…I have written multiple mails to around 5-6 MMT ground team members but to my frustration none of the mails have been responded by none of them hence I am writing it here….To add to my frustration, the customer care nos published at web site are merging into the same call which gets disconnected and never takes us to the customer care executives…I had great trust on MMT earlier but this incidence has led to distrust for my future bookings.I am still hoping someone from MMT will settle this issue for me.",1

Needed to reschedule my flight in India, from Nagpur to Mumbai which was originally booked from USA. Unfortunately india and US sites are not interlinked/ compatible, customer service in India was unable to help, they gave me the run around, provided specific customer service numbers for US bookings but none of them worked. Spent over 4 hrs of endless calls and no assistance!! All of this after I paid an extra charge at the time of booking my tickets in the US, to ensure I had flexibility to update the tickets at any given time! Looks like this is a pretty lousy business model whereby they cannot handle a simple change in flight schedules. Only scamming the customer by taking extra money without any service!!! Quite disappointed! All international travelers please think twice before making any reservations thru makemytrip.com",1

523,"This was the most horrible travel experience I ever had. It all started on 29th May when me and three friends decided for a trip. Immediately searched MakeMyTrip and found an accommodation at Chalet resort Masinagudi. We paid Rs.6000+ and confirmation voucher was also served, only after getting the confirmation we started our travel. But to our surprise on reaching the resort we were told that they do not have any booking in my name and no rooms are left out. We had no choice but to contact MakeMyTrip, tried through the app but the message I got was ""Error Page"", then I tried to call the customer care number and even after trying one hour I was not able to get through the number. Then we decided to search for alternate rooms, but we were not able to find out a suitable room. By the time it was around 5 PM, and either we had to travel to Ooty to find out another room or return. Being a Sunday evening, we were not sure about getting an accommodation at Ooty, so we returned home driving back 200 Kms. Mainly because driving has forbidden in and around Masinagudi after 9 PM. In between, I could talk to the MakeMyTrip executive while returning, and they informed me that they would have provided me an accommodation, had they been contacted. But even after trying all other available options like telephone app etc MakeMyTrip was not available on exigency. They also told me that only room rent charged from me will be refunded and no other compensation would be provided after pushing me to the road. After this, I had three or more mail exchanges with MakeMyTrip to compensate my losses, to which I got one reply from them and for my third mail, I got an automated message that my Ticket is closed in a most unprofessional and heinous way. Am not putting the mail copy or other communications I had with MakeMyTrip here. Even after that, I tried to contact MakeMyTrip customer care number many times but never ever I was able to talk to a human being there. If this is the way you guys behave to a customer, mind you time will teach you who is a customer and how he is to be treated.",3
524,Very nice looking property but not that well managed. Check at the time of booking that complimentary breakfast is included. You will have to pay otherwise at check in because there is no eating point around. More over you have to pay in cash as on line transfer facility is not available. In return you are not going to get the receipt for your payment. Surrounding is good and staying is value for money.,1

545,"It amazes me how these kind of companies still operate in India. We booked for a holiday with MakeMyTrip for Kashmir. 6 nights stay and all travel/sightseeing included. For stay at Srinagar & Gulmarg they have 2 star hotels as a 4 star. Regenta & Heevan Retreat hotel, both crampy rooms, just will pass for a town hotel. MMT says these are 4 star properties based on trip advisor rating. Restaurant & staff member at Heevan was good. MakeMyTrip agents cheat and give false information to the customer just to convince them to purchase their Holiday Package. We made a booking for 7 guests about 3 months before travel to Kashmir. To ensure everything is confirmed, I followed up mutiple times with my travel consulatnt Shaifali Malhotra and travel representative Ishant Gusain and everytime they confirmed that everything is bre-booked and please contact us 3 days prior only for the voucher. However, when I reached Kashmir along with my group we had terrible expericen from day-1. Everytime I had to talk to the local vendors at kashmir to pre-book the activites included in my package. Sikhara ride was not provided to us on Day-1, somehow we managed to get the ride on last day of our trip after multiple follow-ups. In addition, our whole purpose to visit Gulmarg went on a toss. We were suppose to go for a Gondola ride phase-2 in Gulmarg which was confirmed by MMT about three months advance, yet we couldn’t avail the activity. When I contacted local vendor from the MMT side, the person was simply surprised to know we have a confirmed ticket for Gondola ride. I spent my entire day talking to my travel consultant Shaifali Malohtra and local vendor Santosh from MMT. Also, I want to highlight that assitant manager Shaifali Malhotra was not prompt, arrogant and have a reckless attitude towards her work. The entire 2 days at Gulmarg was complete waste for all of us. In return, I received a token of apology and refund for Gondola ride. They make false representation just to make money from people. It's the customer who suffers in the end. We paid double the amout for this package, so that everything goes butter smooth but such a shame that we didn’t receive any support from MMT. I cannot imagine that was not end of the tragedy. When we travelled back to Srinagar on day 6 and arrived at the hotel Regenta, the hotel person was astounded to hear that I had booked 3 rooms at their hotel. And they were sold out completely. The Hotel manager informed that they have never confirmed MMT about room availability. He informed, it’s a frequent issue with MMT online hotel booking; their portal shows that booking is successful for a customer but actually it doesn’t happen, and the customer is in complete shock and despair when he knows from the hotel staff that no room is available. After 90 minutes of discussion with the hotel and MMT, we were provided rooms which are officially allocated to staff members for emergency. All the 3 rooms allocated to us had some or the other issues. The main doors were not completely functional, washbasin was not installed in one of the room and basic hygiene was not maintained. After all that happened, Shaifali Malohtra has refused for refund and stopped answering my phone calls. I literally don’t have any point of contact to discuss my concern and request for refund.",1

The hotls were all 2 star and were booked in the name of 4 star. Specially at Alleppy it was a no star hotel where I can never think of staying with my family. Stinky room, broken toilet seats, rude staff and very very b ad service. The driver assigned to us was very greedy and was always taking us to places where he would get commission. When we did not do as per his wish at the end he just left us at airport and ran away.

We booked online and paid double the price for 2 nights stay this weekend and while booking mandatory we had to select lunch/dinner option we are reaching late night on first day we requested to keep that lunch on the day of checkout. They clearly denied so they should have not charged for lunch or kept an option of booking without lunch this is completely unprofessional and took charges for pickup too and has denied that too. Novotel standards have gone extremely low they are known for location not for services poor extremely poor guest service on double price paid. Not recommended at all,1
552,"Worst experience in terms of property, hygine and food. I had booked Deluxe package for Leh Ladakh in 2nd week of June 2022 through MakeMyTrip. This was a dream destination for us. But the hotel property provided was worst. The property and experience in Tsomiriri, Pangong lake, Leh were like slum areas. Although multiple options for hotel were presented during booking, but the worst property was provided during the stay. The food, bedding and hygiene were worst.  Food (with minimal variety available) was very tasteless, basic and on top of it cold. There were other good properties options available but the worst were allocated. Same category hotel provided to Standard package co-passengers. The on-ground relationship manager's kept on telling us to expect the minimum facilities. If MMT wanted us to expect the minimal then why too high package cost was charged to us? MMT should have also changed the minimal, if they wanted us to expect the minimal. People who had booked pakages from other agencies thoroughly enjoyed the stay as they got good facilities, this was quite evident just by looking around. Me and my family had wasted our valuable time, money for our dream holiday destination, which was a long awaited plan for us. Would not recommend MMT for holiday package booking.",1
553,"Hi, My name is Anuj Jain and I have booked a Dubai Trip from Makemytrip after consulting their representative. I have inquired all the details from them on email and then have made the part payment in March and remaining in Apr Month this year. My journey use to schedule from 16th May from Mumbai to Dubai and return on 19th May this year. After making the payment suddenly the emailed me about change in return flight and they give me one offer without payment to change the flight which I accepted and then after few days again they changed the departure flight and again I accepted. 10 days before they suggested to return an amount close to 124 AED Dirham(near 2600 INR) due to close on one activity, which I didn't not received yet. On 26 Apr, they again changed my departure flight from 15th may to 14th may, due to which I have to Reschedule my Indore to Mumbai flight. On dropping several mails and inquiry they called me and ask to pay extra amount for flight if schedule on 16th may, which I denied to pay. So, they suggested to go on 14th may and arrange 1-day extra charges on Visa and accommodate HOTEL for 2 days by myself. The representative is not picking my call nor replying to my messages after I booked the trip. After dropping mail on Consumer forum they called and ask to change flight to again on 16th May, which I agreed and they provided me tickets on 14th May. On 15th Night I inquired with Royal Gulf Vendor of MMT in DUBAI about my Itinerary and he said that there is no update of flight on 16th may at 8 am. I tried reaching MMT people for 3-4 hours to confirm my transfer in SHARJAH to DUBAI but no one respond. I myself have to convince the DUBAI vendor to transfer me. Till time I have returned and managed the transfer by my own, no one from MMT has coordinated with me regarding same. Still I have no issues. But my refund of 124 AED is still pending for which they have dropped email that I will get it in 15 days but it is not 1 month and no refund has been received not they are responding my emails and chats. I took service from MMT and it was a torture of 2 months from them. Still I managed things by myself in DUBAI.

And to confirm it with MMT, I called them and got an answer saying that there will be a convenience fees and MMT fees and finally the refund amount would be 1954/-. I feel they are taking major chunk of my refund and I was tracking on the app to see when the refund would arrive. Today is May 18th and still I don't see the refund being credited to my account. On the app it says the refund has been processed between May 2 - May 4. I was under the assumption that the refund has been processed automatically but when I checked my bank account, I don't see the amount credited. I called them they said there is a technical glitch from their end due to which the refund was not processed. Whattttt? Assuming that there is a technical glitch, isn't it your responsibility to let the customer know about it. Infact, your app shows the refund has been processed long ago. Isn't this cheating? What if I didn't call you to inquire about my refund.my money would have been gone by now. How many customers will have time to call you to inquire about the refund? Is this how you corporate companies make money? Later the rep asked my bank statement and after some time other guy calls me up claiming that he's from MMT and says he's escalating the issue to the accounts team. And an email comes up says your refund will be processed in 10-14 business days excluding weekends. And another email pops up within hours and says refund has been processed already. This mess was happening from the past 4-5 days and still I don't see my refund. MMT you suck!",1

566,"MakeMyTrip cheated me by booking a hotel which is closed before 2 years. Surprised to be at the moment , how come a hotel booking  agency not verified the details of the hotel for 2 long years. I booked a hotel at Coorg peggoli homestay in advance for a 1 day stay on 15th April 2022. I travelled from Chennai to Coorg in car and while reaching near to Coorg (15th April, around 7pm) we made a call to hotel to confirm location they said the hotel was closed before 2 years. We made a call to customer team to inform the status, they assured of providing an alternate stay within half an hour. But they never called up , again we made a follow up call to know the status. This time they replied will get a call back in another 30 mins. But they cheated again and while asking for a status they simply replied they are not able to find any alternate stay and will cancel my booking and asked us to find a hotel at that time. I was stranded on the road on rainy day and chill weather with a kid for almost 2.30 hours and didn't give a positive reply. If they verify the hotel status earlier and if they informed us we could avoid the useless travel atleast before starting the trip to Coorg. This is unacceptable at the last moment because we travelled more than 700kms and wasted our time, money, effort and spoiled our entire weekend. How come a reputed travel operators couldn't check for a hotel operating condition and allowing the customers to book?? We simply relied on MMT and they cheated us which we didnt expect and couldn't tolerate. I ended up the conversation with MMT (repeated followups) at around 9.30PM and out of no hope we are forced to return back to Chennai at that night time and i dont have experience of driving at hill station during night time. If something happened during the return , do MMT will be answerable for this. I see this situation as a cheating case, because the same MMT customer team tried to reach hotel (Peggoli Homestay) before 5 mins which we tried to same hotel. But even after knowing the status the MMT team didn't replied us. So this can be taken as intentionally cheating customers for business or negligence of caring about customers. Either the one could be the answer. I want to publish this casebecause even after the incident happened to me i checked the same hotel in MMT website they still list the same hotel and allowing booking for the customers. So this clearly shows that they are not caring about the customers and ready to cheat further. I have all mail conversation and audio conversation as proof.",1

The cab was smelly and not clean at all. Just very average. If i have to get a cab like that, why would i pay a premium to mmtc who guarantee hyegiene and cleanliness. The final bill sent from mmtc is not acceptable by driver ane vendor as thier tie up is with some GoZo who sent a different amount. So vendor has one amount, Gozo has another one and mmtc got a third one. Eventually early morning hours I'm arguing with vendor and gozo and settle it out. The billing details says Airport Parking is paid in the invoice but Driver insists that i have to pay parking and i ended up paying 150.

579,"I have been using MakeMyTrip for almost 12 years for all flight, hotel and holiday package bookings. And If I am taking my time to write below detailed review, readers would understand the deteriorated customer committment from MakeMyTrip over the years ending with the last experience that I am detailing below. I have booked Andaman holiday package in March. All selections were premium and Salesperson(Teena from the screenshots) was super Supportive. For the island transfers, I checked with the MMT vendor Makruz and found that they have royal class seats(8 in total, in a separate cabin). Since we are living in a post covid world and I have a 3 year old, I checked with sales, if they can provide me Royal class seats on ferry to reduce the exposure. They checked and confirmed yes(all WhatsApp and email confirmations from MMT are attached) and based on the confirmation(which included 12000K extra payment for booking royal class ferry seats), I paid around 1, 25, 000 INR for the 4N/5 days holiday package. Please note that I have this sales discussion almost a month before the trip and made whole payments 3 weeks before so that they can do the actual bookings. I was told that I will be given actual tickets only a week before the travel. I trusted on MMT sales and operations executive(Prachi) and waited. On 23rd March, I was given the tickets. All was fine, except for the Ferry tickets, which were 'Premium Class', which is the default lower deck ticket. I had paid for Royal class( Premium(lower deck), Deluxe(Upperdeck), Royal(upper deck, private room with 8 seats). From that day to my last ferry transfer, I had my brains eaten by following up for something, for which I paid upfront, I was committed upfront and based on the committments, I choose to choose MMT for the holiday. I finally traveled in premium class, because of wrong booking by MMT. Still, they kept on assuring me as if I am idiot till the actual ferry transfer that they are working on booking the correct ticket. They don't have tele customer care. The emails and WhatsApp screenshots will tell you a clearer story. I am deleting my MMT account after 12 years or so. It's time to find a better travel partner. And after all these, they just refunded the excess amount, that too after multiple followups. Way to treat customer!",3

As per my last conversation with usha she said she trying to get the full refund and following up on the same. After speaking to you I messaged her about about the full refund as she never informed me about not getting full refund on land package but she is not responding now. I understand about visa rejection criteria but not getting full refund on land package was never informed to me. I have already lost money on flight booking as I paid in full while booking the package. I booked so many packages with make my trip never faced any problem and I have booked turkey holiday package with you guys in confidence that I am getting full help with previous package refund but if I will be not given full information about the cancelation in any circumstances is fraud and then getting penalized for that is not right, so I want my full refund for land package.",1

Now MakeMyTrip.com is telling me that I was absent at 5:50 AM at bus stand which is totally silly lie. Now Bus operator is lying. So What should I do? I want my response. I don't know bus operator.

590,"We fourteen of us booked the trip through mmtrip. This was a spiritual trip to most holy cities in India. Our experience is shared below, When we landed in Prayagraj, wewere provided with an old 14 seater tempo traveller, the maximum speed it could go was 50 km/ hour. We complained to our tour coordinator, he told that they will change vehicle. Finally they changed vehicle a day after we reached Kashi. At Kashi, the vehicle was of no use as driver would travel only about 2 kms and stop siting traffic and small roads. From there we were forced to hire auto by paying whatever money the taxi drivers were asking. At the end of it we ended up spending about rs 20000/- on autos for our 4 days stay at Kashi. I am surprised to see how MakeMyTrip gave us a 14 seater TT by charging about Rs 20000+ per day but the same was not usable at Kashi at all !!! Why they did not give us smaller cars or even they could have arranged local autos?? From there we went to Gaya. As some were sick, they prefered to sit in the TT, but the driver used to switch off the A/c !! For two days, we used to complain to MakeMyTrip officer, he used to say it won't be repeated, but unfortunately, the driver always used to switch off the ac saying MakeMyTrip pays him by km travelled ! It became a ritual to plead and fight but all in vain. No guides were provided any where nor any guidance was there from MakeMyTrip. In nut shell, I feel as a tour operator MakeMyTrip is a an useless company. If one believe in paying money and not expecting service, this tour operator MakeMyTrip is okay. Mr Vishwa, Center Head, Bengaluru and Mr Vivek Rai, SPOC for trip @ UP, besides saving a bit, have earned company lots of undesirable stuff, i.e. hugely unsatisfied customers and customer chain, due to shortcuts being followed. I am sure Mr Deep Kalra has built this company with lots of hard work and dedication and would never have imagined that after a appreciable success, the company would loose customer focus and it's staff concentrate on pennies and not bother about pounds, I mean sustained and consistent business with growing satisfied customers. I am stopping my review at this only, just visited holy places and do not want to spoil my mind.",3

I suggest to support the Non hindi speaking and solo  travelers .,1
593,This is my experience with MMT These people are second party and the property owners happen to be third party.  I happened to book a room in Karaikudi and I booked the room for ten days.  Upon finding in the amenities provided I noticed that AC facility was missing.  I called the hotel directly and checked the details then they told me that they never had any tie up with MMT but have tie up with OYO and that too thye have given permission to OYO to book rooms only for two days where as for ten days the booking is not valid.  I had to cancel the booking and directly booked my hotel through those people.  since I am from the same state and had some friends in the locality they obliged and rented my the room slightly at higher rate I got it.  Else in the early morning around 4 30 am I would have got stranded in the town without any stay.  Please dont do hotel booking through MMT.  And before booking verify the hotel people directly by calling them.  This is my advice.  ONE POSITIVE MESSAGE TO SAY - The MMT have refunded my entire money after cancellation.  Thanks for that.  In that way I have to appreciate their honesty.,1
594,"I am Srinivasan. Booking ID NL2131003014864. 6N-7D package to Kashmir. It surprises me, but the most nightmarish experience that I have ever had was by one of the leading travel planner Make My Trip. When going is good, these travel agencies will look good, but the true character shows up when the going get tough and how your travel provider communicates and deals with you. I traveled to Kashmir with my 7-year-old daughter and wife, and Here are the situations that I was put through and how MMT treated me: 1. Onward Travel - Nightmare 1 Sunday morning was my start date. On Friday late evening MMT tells me that I need to travel on Saturday evening itself as the Sunday flight got cancelled, and stay overnight without sleep with a kid in Mumbai Airport and take early morning flight to Srinagar, and be stranded till 2 PM hotel check-in. Would have been the worst way to start a 7day trip, with a sleepless night. Fake - I called up the airlines and they said the flight is very much on schedule, but since mine was a group booking I had to contact MMT. Positives - After fighting over calls for an entire day, MMT agreed to reimburse my overnight stay in lounge. 2. Onward Travel - Nightmare 2 Saturday 9:50 PM was the rescheduled flight. But I kept calling them from morning 6 am, but the personal travel assistant (BHANU SACHDEVA - +91-844849XXXX) simply would not pick up. I left so many what's app messages, she will not respond. But I kept getting an email from her boss (MAYANK) asking me to be patient. But they cannot pick my call to say even once. Things get absolutely crazy now. (BHANU SACHDEVA - +91-844849XXXX) calls me at 6:45 PM to tell me that my flight is at 9:50 PM as communicated earlier. I spring out of my seat, book a cab to catch a flight with less than 3 hrs. I board the cab, BHANU SACHDEVA's - (+91-844849xxxx) boss MAYANK calls me to tell my flight is only at 5:30AM on Sunday. So extremely dramatic day with absolutely ZERO communication and only lies from MMT. Scenario 2 proves my call earlier that they were faking it when they said my flight is cancelled. 3. Arrival at Srinagar: My package included a tour manager assistant. It was SANTOSH (+91-909696xxxx). I hope one can understand the apprehensions and fear of someone who is going to Kashmir for the first time. I was told that I need to wait for this gentleman SANTHOSH (+91-909696xxxx) who will introduce me to the driver. I kept calling this guy, his number was constantly busy, and finally, after 45 mins he picks up and asks me (note, he did not know, he asked me) when are you supposed to come. And tells me he cannot come as he is stuck in traffic jam which he could have told if he had any plans to come. He gave me the driver's number, whom I located and boarded the cab. By the way, I never saw my tour assistant, or received by call from him asking me how things were, but I still paid for a tour assistant, I don't know for what joy. 4. Cab issue I was promised and was charged for an AC Sedan. In all the confusion in not being able to contact my travel assistant SANTHOSH (+91-909696xxxx), I did not pay attention that I got a Tavera and not an AC Sedan. Fast forward a couple of days, my travel from Gulmarg to Pahalgam was extremely hot and then I realised I was supposed to have an AC Sedan and not a Tavera. You may wonder what's the issue I got a bigger car - no Tavera is generally used in Kashmir by the travel union folks who takes you till the last mile. For example, in winters the superior vehicle you pay for will take you only till Tangmarg, from there you have to hire a local cab (Tavera, Sumo, etc.) to go to Gulmarg. Similarly, you have to hire a local cab in Pahalgam also. Having paid a bomb, I did my entire travel in a Tavera and hired those local cabs also which again were Taveras. The travel assistant Anil in Pahalgam told me once that the local cab which they will provide (as it was part of my package) will be a Tavera or Sumo which will not be upto MMT standards, and that when i realised her where is my Sedan. So I did my entire trip in Kashmir in a vehicle that was not as per MMT standards, but they still charged me for a superior vehicle. From the time I raised this concern, they kept telling something to my driver that he kept asking me what was the problem - I personally did not have any problem with the cab driver, in fact, he was a gem of a person we thoroughly enjoyed, but only concern here is why was I not given what I paid for, and why didn't MMT know which can I was on. MMT has no clue on how your travel is happening on ground. Which I believe is your travel assistant's job whom you would hardly meet. When I called BHANU SACHDEVA - +91-844849xxxx - she as usual ignored my call and sent me a WhatsApp note asking me to contact SANTHOSH (+91-909696xxxx), who is her bigger brother (pun intended) in hospitality. 5. Return Flight - Here is the biggest mess up. By the way, I am writing this review as I am sitting in my flight back, with utmost frustration. In the itinerary that MMT gave me, my return flight was at 5:45 PM on Saturday. I kept calling SANTHOSH (+91-909696xxxx) and BHANU SACHDEVA (+91-844849XXXX) telling them my web check-in is not happening. They kept telling me they are checking, give me 10 mins, 15 mins, for one whole day. BHANU SACHDEVA - (+91-844849xxxx) messages me 3 hrs before travel stating she has sorted it out and asked me to go without web check-in. I presented my ticket to get boarding pass and the agent tells me my PNR is wrong. The Time is 4:10 pm, now in parallel, I receive an attachment from BHANU SACHDEVA (+91-844849xxxx) stating my flight is at 4:30 PM, and the earlier printout given was wrong. The agent in the airport tells me it's too late, the boarding is closed. One should keep in mind the kind of security that is in place in Srinagar airport, it is impossible to skip anything. My daughter was running temperature the previous night, so I literally begged as there was no guarantee of another flight and I could not imagine a night on transit with feeble health conditions after travel fatigue. Points to note -Both the hospitality siblings BHANU SACHDEVA's - (+91-844849xxxx) and SANTHOSH (+91-909696xxxx) just would not do anything. Hearing me shout SANTHOSH (+91-909696xxxx) stopped hanging my calls. No prizes for guessing BHANU SACHDEVA's - (+91-844849xxxx) would still not pick my call. NEVER EVER AGAIN ON M(F)AKE MY TRIP. I am sure many must have had great experience with MMT, but as I said earlier, I would judge based on how one behaves during crisis than when things go well. The fact is MMT has no clue how travel happens on ground, they are busy minting from new customers after they make the sale. But on a positive note I would like to call out Nitu Kathpalia from sales team who not only made us feel comfortable during the sales process when we were very skeptical about this trip, but also supported through out the trip. If not for her, we would have had any of our issues sorted. The way she explained and understood our concerns throughout is unmatched. Seems like sales team is the only reason why MMT is still in business. The relationship team is filled with uncourteous people who simply are unfit to be in the hospitality business. Beware if these folks are your travel assistants. BHANU SACHDEVA's - (+91-844849xxxx) SANTHOSH (+91-909696xxxx)",1

597,"Seriously Hopeless They spoiled my honeymoon tour. I booked honeymoon package and once payment done there was no customer support. I added personal photoshoot as an activity and we waited at location for 3 hours but no photographer came no customer support provided. We wasted a whole day because of photoshoot but no one cared. The sales girl said she will give refund of photoshoot and since then she is also not giving any support. Its very difficult to reach customer support. We missed our flight and tried to reach a person assigned to us, on ground team, customer support and that sales girl but no one cared and just said we will get back but no one called back. They didn’t even cared if we reached home safely or not and how we managed extended stay and new flight booking. Airline website shows they refund is processed for my PNR number but from MMT no one is responding. They don’t care about customer once your payment is done to their account. Fraud MMT.

In my case I was forced to cancel my child's ticket to Dubai in Jan'22 because she tested COVID+ in RTPCR and hence was not eligible to fly. MMT feigned concern bigtime and made me apply through them to Air India for a waiver of cancellation chgs supported with RTPCR report etc, expressing I stood a good chance since it was a genuinue case. Next thing I see they have closed the case abdruptly and are not accessible over mails or phone! I somehow found my ways to chase them and finally they refunded two third of the ticket amount and took a whopping almost 6500 Rs on account of cancellation chgs, which included around Rs5000 cancellation chgs of Air India coupled with their own exorbitant cancellation amount too without any consideration or compassion on their part! I corresponded with Air India and gathered that the airline had refunded the amount to MMT who took advantage and pocketed the cancellation chgs after cleverly “using” me to write for a waiver to Air India  through them! Turning adversity into opportunity is clearly the forte of these glib talking manipulators! I have exposed them on FB and Twitter n all they say is that this should not have happened and they would look into it and provide a logical closure (bah), followed by complete silence!

601,"MakeMyTrip keeps its customer care behind a china wall. You cannot reach them. I had a bad experience with a hotel booked through makemytrip. The only option to leave feedback is through a pre-structured form and a characters limited free text.

Four days down the line - there is an issue ticket - but the tracking says no tickets are open, raised or closed. You call them - the  issue is mentioned as a selectable option, and they say its under resolution - and after that you have no option to talk to anyone. Lack of options to talk to someone is quite scary - imagine you run into a situation, and you have no one to talk to . Make my trip is happy to make money from transactions, but the odd one time that you have a problem - there is no one to talk to. And DO NOT do hotel bookings with them  they seem to be inclined to side with the hotel and not the customer.

They will not give refund amount even after deducting cancellation fee. For us cancellation was done amount or gift card didn't get in wallet or bank account. Then we reached out to relationship manager, she said not to call her as she is not getting response from higher management. What kind of organisation is this where their own employees will not get response. If they say that, what should customers say. 2 part is customers care service is worst. All the ticket raised will get closed with auto response. 3rd part we posted in all social media, dropped several mails for about 3 weeks. Then a person responded and provided gift card details where they added our refund. When we checked gift card it had only half of refund amount. When we mentioned this that gift card was taken back and nothing was given to us. We were wanted to book flights for travel purpose, so we asked again for details, nothing happened.

The room allocated to us was just above their dumping area, so it was stinking badly. Because of this, we could not enjoy the balcony and the view for which we had paid heavily. After complaining abt this on MMT, they simply refuse for cancellation or refund because the hotel owner did not accept the mistake. Now, who would accept that yesy hotel is not upto the standards. But MMT gave importance to the words of the hotelier than its customers. Plus no coption of changing the hotel or refund or voucher was offered to us.So we had to suffer silently in that dumping room for 2 nights. Don't use MMT ever",1
620,"I was cancelled the booking, and request for the refund they send one link after many calls & mail for the status of refund, they confirmed my refund amount is credited in my wallet, when I checked my wallet it is showing zero amount after I was called to customer care he was informed me amount is not credited so he was send one format to fill and send it back for amount transfer after 100 call and more than 50mails, they are no responding.

My brother had paid this fraud company Rs.2020 on behalf of me to travel from Bangalore to Ujjain on 07th Jan 2022. I raised a complaint by calling them several times in their customer care number to which they replied that refund would be done within 5-7 working days. And then after 20 days when I tried reaching them out, hardly I got a person(a lady) somehow connected through IVR and after listening to my complaint she just abruptly disconnected the call. That's how manner-less & rude'customer care representatives' are. I've even got their mail regarding'Refund Confirmation'(MakeMyTrip Booking ID NR7200223267254394) from this fraudsters but still nothing has been done so far. Such a low-grade activity they've done that they don't connect with you even through IVR once they know that it is a'Complaint' and upon everything, nobody can find a'raise an issue/ complaint/ support tab' anywhere in their WEBSITE.",1

When I informed my issue to MMT they didn’t bother to assist and the relationship manager Rupini switched off her mobile and other girl named Akanksha was giving me lame reasons for not assisting me. This gentleman named Akshay calls me and says mail, ""Please mail us your issue. We will assist you immediately, "" and he is missing later. When we were booking our travel they called us like 10 times but when we had issue no one bothered. And on top of this driver stopped by expensive places for food, or even for dresses that we had to hire for Shimla and Manali points. He knew people and he wasn’t ready to take us anywhere else. He stopped by to purchase vegetables but when we wanted to click a pic he was like ""Abhi nai badme karlena."" “Atrocious behaviour” Guys please don’t book via makemytrip they are just looting people.",1

632,"I booked 6N7D trip in last week of December 2021. It was tortuous experience not coz of Kashmir bt coz of people who I met. Driver who picked us at Srinagar airport upon arrival started arguing why are you late and all. Told him even after flight lands, its take time. His car was caught by police 2-3 times. He was supposed to be a authentic MMT driver. Police took his DL and release car. They asked us to show flight ticket and booking details. Driver panicked and couldn't handle anything. Driver didn't had fast way recharge. Car was again pulled and we were asked to wait for 15 mins. As part of itenary, we had to visit Vishnu temple but driver ignored it as per his convenience and when I confronted him, he called multiple people from god knows where who introduced themselves as MMT representative and started convincing me instead. There was one more person who introduced himself as MMT rep but started arguing when I denied guide and other services. Hotel in Srinagar was pathetic. Am attaching pics/ videos for your reference. I insisted MMT that I need 3 or more star hotels but looking at the condition, it was so pathetic it wouldn't fall within 1 star hotel as well. There were so called MMT folks at destined locations who ere supposed to help us but instead they also were redirecting to other peoples, talking in rude tone, forcing to take'guides' as commission is fixed for everyone starting from drivers and also these MMT reps. Overall because of such issues and handling these kind of people, I fell sick coz of tension and which was supposed to be a relaxing trip, I will remember as the one dealing with pathetic group of people MMT authorize them there as representatives. Edit: Unable to add multiple pics/ videos.",1
633,"Hello - I am a keen user of Make my trip and I have loved utilising the services from MMT but this trip changed my thoughts completely. I had no insight about Sikkim and was less on time to book my package. Hence, Booked package No# NL2111742862644 on 26th November. Major concerns Sikkim had 2 airports through which we could have reached - Sikkim airport and Bagdodra airport but I was provided with Bagdodra airport. It took me 6 hours to reach gangtok which was extremely painful with a kiddo On reaching Gangtok, I was supposed to get 4-star hotel with a hill view but nothing of this was available.When we spoke to the hotel, they charged 1k per day extra.(On the current day the price of the room was 3-4k only) On complaining to the coordinator, the complaint was transferred to backend and it took around 48 hours to raise the refund after continuous follow ups. The guide provided in the tour had no knowledge of the sight seeing places which was very unprofessional and was least interested to accompany us. Lastly, the return flight booked was for 1:40 pm knowing that it would take 6 hrs 30 mins to reach the airport again which meant that I was supposed to leave hotel by 5 am. It was extremely painful. Had I known it would take 6 hours to reach to airport, I would have never booked this flight. At the end, I just need my GST bill for which they are not reachable",1

637,Let me tell you honestly. First of all this unnamed so called hotel and very hard to find. It is not hotel at all. It is complete scam.  It is just 5 to 6 rooms place that too in old and dirty place. If you go at location site you will find the Hotel Lazeez name not Jessy Residency. The whole area is congested and have all around smoke with no ventilation. The rooms were messy and supposed never cleaned. Honestly you can't stay there 1 minute. The rooms doesn't have even keys. It is used for mostly hourly based couples. The staff stayed there got also surprised that this is not suitable for families. I had family with me so I immediately checked out back and contact makemytrip but even makemytrip didn't help. They take all my money and didn't refund while I got cheated. I strongly urge people avoid these type of hotels. I urge also people please use other sites as well and not trust even makemytrip blindly,3

640,"Original booking ID: NH7404290354238 New ID: NH2208291238902 Booking was made through trusted brand MMT for my parents to celebrate the new year in Udaipur. Their original dates were 6th-9th January 2022. (Refer to original booking ID) Their booking included stay + breakfast + 1 major meal. Due to some reasons, their travel dates had to be changed to 1st-4th January 2022. The date change through MMT costed me close to an additional ₹15, 000. (New booking ID) However, without my consent, they removed my meal plan altogether. As per the new booking ID, NO MEALS we’re included. Being a trusted brand, I didn’t check the finer print myself of the revised voucher. This was brought to our notice only when my parents reached the hotel and were refused their meals. After nearly 12 calls to various customer care representatives, (Saurav, Suresh, Nima, Parul) and 1 floor manager (Alice) over a period of 48 hours, absolutely no solution was given. Every time they promise to call me back with a solution, they magically forget to call me back. So I have to call them again and explain my whole situation again to a very lost and immature call center representative. According to the floor manager - Alice, the Area Manager, who’s in charge of such situations, has not turned up for work, is not answering phone calls, or replying to emails since 48 hours. What an excellent and dedicated set of managers the company has. My parents’ trip will be ending tomorrow, 4th January, and they will have paid nearly double of their initial booking amount because of an incompetent team like MMT. As per my last telephonic conversation, I’m supposed to receive a call back today at sharp 2 PM from the area manager because that’s their reporting time on a Monday morning. I wish my company allowed me to start my day at 2 PM. If a solution is not given to me as per my satisfaction by the end of the day today, I will be taking legal action against the company. This is not a threat, this is just a very frustrated customer who thought of giving their parents a good experience, which has turned into a nightmare because of an irresponsible group of people who call themselves a part of MMT.",1
641,"We were a group travelling to Srilanka(Bentota) and a hotel booking was made through MMT for a total of 10 rooms for the new year 2022. After landing in SriLanka, travelling by road for 3 hours to reach our hotel, we were made to wait in the lobby for about 7 hours to get our rooms for an already confirmed hotel. Imagine a group of 10 adults and 6 children all sitting/sleeping in the lobby for so long especially during pandemic times. We called MMT customer care team from 2:23pm to 6:50pm and  created 12+ service tickets, spoke to 12 different customer service reps., but to no resolution till evening. Every call to customer care was a nightmare!!!! The same story was repeated in Colombo booking as well!! Please please DO NOT book any INTERNATIONAL travels with MMT. We had a miserable start of our new year and will never think of MMT for any of our future travels.",1
642,"Do not get happy with the price listed by Aloft in MakeMyTrip. I booked for 3 adults. Though the price summary says for 3 adults / night somewhere in the footer they mentioned the price is for two adults. Wondering why MakemyTrip encouraging such practice. Per night price per adult should be mentioned in the price summary page not on footer section of the voucher. For others terms and conditions/rules like extra bed, etc. it is fine to put in footer but not for the room price for extra adult.",1
643,"Be very careful to book hotels through this site, they follow different prices for the same facility/ dates/ category etc. when you try via laptop versus mobile. suggestion of coupons are also misleading, they wont allow you to use giftcards to be used along with the coupons.( as if the gift cards are bought at a discounted price). I had a facility that I tried to book using the money in my wallet & the wallet money was not even reflecting in laptop logging, while it was reflecting only on mobile, which had a different price & it does not allow you to pick any coupon code( a loss of 25% just because of this reason). had to stick onto MMT just for the reason to utilize the money that was wasted as gift card. The next worst thing is the  human touch on the customer care, the most irritiating IVR options you get & there is no absolute option to talk to a customer service individual. you can reach only through emails which is not a timebound or worth waiting solution. we are in the year 2021 and I can see that these guys are still stone aged & not worth working with these guys.",3
644,"Hi in last couple of years I have really bad experience with mmt. Earlier mmt was my default place for all hotel, flight booking and even all my holidays. But recently l have lost my trust in mmt. In last couple of years, mmt charged me hotel booking abnormally high. Currently I am at a hotel (SDM Rameshwaram). According to reception the room I got on MMT for 4155 rupees is for 2500 at hotel including all the taxes. That means mmt is charging almost double the hotel prices. The same exp I had last year in Udupi. If you book hotel from mmt, just try giving call to hotel directly and see the price difference. I have uninstalled mmt app and never going to use it again",1

But I have an iPhone which doesn’t support two sims. I give the number attached to my WhatsApp so that driver details are sent there. Haven’t faced problems with any other sites I booked cabs from. MMT also sends the most rash, rude and dangerous drivers. PATHETIC. Once upon a time it was good, now you’re better off deleting the app and never going to their website. Much better companies in the market.",1
647,Worst service. Worst team to handle genuine consumer complaints. First they gave a very bad hotel which was completely unhygienic. There was no one at the hotel to vent grievance.

Me and my husband have been calling here and there for help but have achieved nothing. As always the RO Deny Davis has told us we cannot help it you either stay there or look for an accommodation on ur own at 6.30pm where the streets are pich dark we have been told to manage things on our own. She's a female and I thought she would understand how unsafe this place can be for a female to live even for a night. MMT IS THIS HOW ULL TREAT THE CUSTOMERS. Providing such hotel (Lodges). If anything goes wrong with us here it's MMT that'll be held responsible for.,1

Reached out to customer service, casually the person told me just(for them Rs. 299/- is Just) Rs. 299/- will be deducted and we will cancel the booking. You make a new booking with the fare hike. Support agent wants me to pay additional convenience fee and do new booking with fare increase. Agent was just give me recorder solution and was asking me for screen shot of system error.

674,"Believe me they will leave no efforts to spoil your trip, After taking full payment & even after the cancelation period is over, they won't provide you with details of your vouchers, they would be paying for airline tickets just 48 hours before departure, would delete various sightseeing places added by you without any hesitation & tell you that you can see them on direct payment basis, would refuse any of the services booked by you at last moment & then you have to fight for your rights. They would provide you with wrong information about the destination regarding documents to carry, mobile networks etc. It's much better to book a package from local agents then from these UTHAIGIRA's. Their relationship manager wouldn't call you, you have to be after them or their seniors for getting things done, which won't be ever done. Shame on Makemytrip.",1
675,"We booked Meeru island resorts with my friends on 23rd July 2021, We booked for two nights, To our surprise on arrival They Resorts did RT PCR test and locked us in room, They tole RT PCR will come in few hours( 5-6hrs), As we went there for two nights  only . Day 1 . No report . day 2 . report came art mid night . after 33 hrs. We had flight very next day morning . If the resort have this typical rule of locking guest like a prisoner, Make my trip should inform about this, We could have booked some other resorts . They charged us Speedboat charges even if we checked before booking of all charges, Its MMT special package, where they mentioned all charges are paid, resorts also confirmed the same over mail . but they forced us to pay the charges again",1
676,I am long time customer of makemytrip but now i have lost respect for you due to the cheating happen. I have use the price lock option to hold a flight ticket for me and my friends on 31/09/2021 And the bookind id is NF71143319462370. As per it was stated that i can complete the payment before September 1st 8 pm. But as soon as the ticket price rises you have cancelled my price hold ticket the what is the use of the scheme. Its a biggest cheat. And i have to book a ticket again for the high price for 26200 and the booking id is NF71143319570332. Due to your cheating i have lost respect with my friends travelling along with me. Those two are poor people 3700 rs they have to pay extra due to your price lock fraud scheme. Otherwise we would have booked the ticket a day before itself. And no response till now from there custoler care side. Dont lock the price and wait for these fraud group,1
677,"Chor company , , I booked a cab yesterday from MMT from Dehradun to Delhi but the guy first did not contacted and when the details came of the driver we contacted him.. he was 15km away from the location he said he will not come to the location as it is too far away and time was 2pm he said if he will be late you have to pay the penalty after some time he reached near to his location not ours and said come to this location and he said to MMT people he is on the location and all that stuff after some time he cancelled the ride and after few minutes he called to us and said I will be going with you and come to ur place at higher prices and after that today we saw  the app oF MMT he had completed the ride as then we came with our convince. We did not got the refund too .Please don't book anything from MMT.",1
678,"This website makes me want to petition for a zero star rating. I'm not even sure if there is a customer service to this appalling agency. I have been trying to reach them continuously for the past 3 days to make some changes to multiple flight tickets I had booked through them, but it has never crossed the automated voice call stage which was really useless and gave me no helpful information. There has been no response to my emails either. They take our money and it's done from their end, nothing to do with the customer after that. Now I find myself believing all the terrible reviews posted by various customers. It all makes sense now. A sincere request MakeMyTrip- please shut down your business if you don't give a damn about your customers. Let's all save some time, energy. Thanks.",1
679,"Very bad experience of cab ride from Bareilly to Lucknow. The driver kept talking on phone all the time n opened the drivers door frequently to spit- so whatever slight AC was working,  that also failed n it was hot in the car. There were no seat belt hook sets in the rear seats, only hanging belts!! Driver was lying on many issues including seat belts- that they don't come in Honda Amaze!!- They just hang seat belts without provision to use them!!!!! Atleast MAKE MY TRIP SHOULD INSURE THAT ALL SEAT BELTS ARE WORKING IN THEIR CABS. And they charged much more than normal with all the above issues.",1
680,"Have been a loyal customer of MMT for 7+ years. I still love their response for flights and cabs. For the first time booking an international holiday package with them and was horrible. Note: I am an MMT black exclusive member which is the highest tier of membership in MMT and still has such poor customer service. A Maldives vacation of 5 days and 4 nights itinerary converted to 3 days and 4 nights trip. Leaving aside the bad resort experience as that will go on review of the resort. Detailed summary about the mishaps - Issues - Issue 1 - Arrival time at Male airport on 2nd September at 16:00. The expected time to reach the resort is mentioned to be 2 hrs. Any logical person would assume to reach by 19:00 and in the worst-case scenario by 21:00. I was in Male airport till 23:30. Making excuses like flight might be late or similar will not work as another couple who had completed visa processing by 16:00 were also sent to resort with us. There was no other plan to send us to the resort other than the late-night arrival. MMT sold misleading itineraries. There are two things here. 1-a) The booking itinerary and the holiday booking card both mention very clearly that there would be no travel between 11 pm-5 am and MMT violated its terms and conditions. We were supposed to be in the resort on Day1 but we weren't. We reached the resort on Day2 at 2:00. We paid for the plan and we were not given the facilities. This again violates the booking itinerary and booking card. 1-b)  We reached our rooms at 2:30 am on 3rd September. We were so tired that we woke up around the afternoon on the 3rd. We just didn't lose the 2nd but also the morning of the 3rd. I will be kind and just take it as a half-day loss. Issue 2 - Departure from Male airport on 6th September was at 17:05.  The expected time to reach the resort is mentioned to be 2 hrs. Any logical person would assume to leave the resort by 12:30 and in the worst-case scenario by 11:00. We were made to leave the resort at 6:30. We had to sleep early 1 night before to wake up early the next day. This is again a more than half-day loss for us. Adding it to the earlier half-day loss, we lost 2 half days. We didn't have enough time on our hands to enjoy things we had planned, activities that were present, or wear the dresses we had taken. This is a very expensive trip and one doesn't take such trips often and MMT just ruined it. Absolutely nothing was done for Issue-1 or Issue-2. We talked to a lot of people who came to the resort and everyone had a similar experience and the resort behaves like that for arrival and departure so this is not a one-time thing for MMT. MMT representative sold me a higher package with a misleading itinerary. Two half-days were not provided at the resort which is the major component(25%) of the package. Issue 3 - The RO(relationship officer), let's call her ""B"" is supposed to be the contact source for any issues. They need to keep checking for any issues and be the primary source of contact. B, in our case, stopped responding to messages or picking calls from 4th September night. I tried contacting MMT through any other means for any customer support to get a resolution and save the 2nd half days but since I only had WhatsApp so couldn't and B had stopped replying to messages and picking calls. She didn't even check if I filled the forms or reached back to India. I was just left helpless at the resort from the MMT side. Issue 4 - A(Issue resolution team member) came into the picture on 4th September. Was supposed to call by the 4th September end and knew I wouldn't be reachable as I was not in India. Still, he made the trademark excuse on 5th September evening that I was not reachable. If you are duping customers, at least train them well. He didn't connect till 5th September late evening, asked about the experience and same. I asked to drop a message as 2 days had passed for the complaint and nothing happened and he promised to do it in 10 minutes. I had to complain again to even get an email from him. By now, it did seem like a regular occurrence with similar trips, where the representative just passes it to someone and spends time till the trip gets over. I even asked B if this is a scam because it seems like one.",2
681,"We had a trip to coorg recently. Overall journey was awesome experience with MMT but when you are paying so much you expect a better relationship manager who is proactive and ready to help. Surprisingly i got someone whose name was Anu Joneja such a rude and mean relationship manager one should not come across and God forbid if anyone do please change her immediately. She is absolutely of no use and will never receive your calls and when you ping her for queries she will talk to you rudely and spoil your mood. I had to call customer care and get details one day before journey for a celebration planned, for which she refused to help straight away. Cab driver we got was good though alongwith hotel but manager i would request everyone to please check before only as these people don't do anything simply increase travel costs and worries.",1
682,"We booked a ticket to the US for our son thru MMT in Feb'21 and due to rescheduling of a flight when we said we could not accept the reschedule, MMT went ahead and cancelled our ticket.

Now we plan to go to the court since we sent many mails and phone calls and it always used to be a repetitive message of delay but no firm date.",1

684,"Till date we have used MMT 2 times for Conducted tour package and the experience was good and within our budget. TOUR-1 My family and our relatives consisting of 22 people(6 families) travelled to Europe in the 10 day package in the year 2016. Countries covered in the package were France, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and Italy. First we approached MMT customer care who then allotted us a representative from Bangalore office  to discuss about the tour package and other things .The Representative had agreed for a discussion meeting at our house who would explain the package and modify according to our needs. The meeting went well and we did our modifications accordingly to suit our budget. The Total package apart from Visa costs around ₹1.5L/person, however they took care of Visa documentation and we had to Visit the Shivajinagar Visa office(Bangalore) for the Visa process and paid the Visa fees separately. All the process was completed smoothly. We were offered payment options in instalments(before the trip) after which they sent accessories(1 per family) consisting of Universal adaptor, Selfie stick, MMT backpack, cap. The entire trip in Europe was covered on road by bus where we used to travel during the day and at the end of day rest at the Hotel so no overnight travel. DAY1: Departure from Bangalore on an Air India flight to Delhi and from Delhi boarded an Air India Dreamliner flight to Paris for around 7-8 hrs non stop flight. We landed at Paris and were taken to our Hotel(Golden Tulip) by our tour Guide Mr Ashir which is near the airport and we took rest for the day. DAY 2: They arranged car from Hotel from where we went to the hilltop church after which we were free to roam around Paris  till afternoon(around 3pm) after which the actual tour starts from Eiffel tower(to the top during day time) . After Eifel tower we were taken to various monuments and building in Paris including the Arch De Triumph street. Day 3: We visited Disneyland Paris for almost a day till evening. Disneyland was not that great for us but was enjoyed by kids. After Disneyland we went back to our hotel, refreshed and visited Eiffel tower(not to the top) at the night for the beautiful light display and enjoy the night with beautiful music from artists nearby. The food at the hotel was good and tasty  but they didn't segregate veg and non veg  food at the Dining hall. Day 4: We had breakfast and checked out from the hotel in the morning .From here we went to Brussels(Belgium) and reached there by afternoon 1pm .We reached the square and roamed around to have lunch, visited churches and even bought chocolates(were expensive and not great as the Lindt chocolate you get in Switzerland). After lunch we proceeded to visit the Atomium garden/park and enjoyed there. After that we travelled to Netherlands and checked in at our hotel(Holiday INN) by 8:00pm. DAY 5: We checked out from our hotel after breakfast  then visited the Tulip Garden which was huge and very beautiful with trees, lakes and artificial streams and spent a good time there. Also we visited the local farms where we bought authentic cheese  and later went to Germany Hotel 1. Day 6: We spent our time at Germany and visited the churches and EOD we checked in at our Germany Hotel 2. Day 7; We proceeded to Black Forest on our way to Switzerland(Engelberg) where we bought the famous Cuckoo clock(mechanical one) which costed around 200 Euros .from there we proceeded towards Switzerland and the journey was beautifull surrounded by snow capped mountains and rivers plus its was raining .We visted Local Zurich and proceeded to the hotel Day 8: We departed early(to avoid rush and delay) to Mount Titlis by cable car and spent a good time at the top. Good thing was that it was snowing heavily at the top Day 9:We checked out from hotel and went to Milan and spent time there on our own and visited Milan churches, flee market etc for the full day and checked in at Holiday INN located near the airport Day 9: Departure to India(Milan-> Delhi-> Bangalore). TRIP-2 Similarly we went on a 7 day trip to UAE(Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Dessert near the border) which costed around ₹50k/person .We had booked the flights rest all were managed. Apart from conducted tours we also used to book domestic flights on MMT, they offered cheap rates and offers. Overall I prefer MMT for conducted trips and for flights I compare fares across other websites also and chose the best fares available . Most of the time MMT offers best rates.",1
685,"MMT cab services are okay to use only in big cities [A-1 cities as per govt authorized HRA classification if cities]. I used the MMT cab service 3 times in a month to travel between A listed cities [as per govt authorized HRA classification]. All the 3 travel experiences were horrible. The drivers were unaware about the GPS, Fastag usability. They had no regards for these services. Moreover, they dealt in cash for all transactions. For State travel taxes also, they first asked Rs. 1000, then when we refused to pay in cash, he asked for Rs. 700. One of the driver was unable to use OTP service to start the trip and even after confirming with MMT support executive, he refused to start the trip. All such dramas delayed each of our trips by 30-60 mins. Never, ever, ever use MMT for A or lesser rated cities(HRA classification).",1

687,"@makemytripindia@makemytrip# makemytripindia # makemytrip makemytrip.com Serious concern:  I booked hotel - ""The Tiger Groove"", Jim Corbett(Ramnagar) from #MakeMYTrip(Booking Id: NH70199282986346) on 24th October 2023 and my booking was confirmed from #MMT.When I reached hotel after 6-7 hours of continuous driving, hotel manager said we have not received any booking confirmation from #MakeMYTrip against your Booking Id: NH70199282986346 and refused to provide us any room. Due to the fault from MakeMYTrip end, hotel did not receive any confirmation email in advance. When I called the #MakeMYTrip customer care, someone named Ajay picked up the call, I explained everything to him and also connected him with Hotel manager. The hotel manager asked Ajay to resend the booking email which was sent to the hotel on booking date but MMT customer care person Ajay was unable to forward those emails. Due to the fault from MakeMYTrip end, hotel did not receive any confirmation email in advance. Due to peak holiday season, hotel was already full and hotel manager denied to give me any room.  MMT customer care person Ajay told me they are refunding my amount and asked me to find alternative myself. I asked him to provide me alternative bookings as none of the hotels is available on these dates due to long weekends, but they denied for any alternate bookings and offered me 25% reimbursement(maximum 3000) on new bookings but they were not ready to give me alternate hotels. I tried a lot to find hotels nearby but I did not find any hotels. It was very frustrating and upset situation for me as I was with my family including my girl child. I asked MMT customer care person Ajay to connect with any senior person or authority so that I can get any hotel room but they denied of doing so. I was in nowhere situation, stuck in an unknown place with my family. It spoiled all my holiday and fun mood and we all had to return back only mapping through the roads. This is very irresponsible way of MakeMYTrip and I will file a complaint against all the mental harassment happened with me. They did not compensate anything for such a big mistake and harassment. I am posting this to connect with any higher authority of MakeMYTrip. I am never going to book any hotel through this platform that turned my holiday into the worst day of my life. All tired, we had nothing to do expect wandering in our car and returning back to our home as we had planned to take rest first in this hotel after so much driving and then explore the natural places at this tourist place. All in vain for a response from the senior officials of MMT. Such a pathetic experience. I won't recommend anyone about this platform after such a horrible experience. I need a good compensation against this as it wasted my precious time, money, mental peace and left all my family wandering on the roads.

692,Please share this post. It will help others. People shouldn't make any flight booking through Makemytrip. I made a flight booking through MMT. However the flight was rescheduled. As the new timing was not convenient I cancelled the booking. Full refund is applicable for rescheduled/cancelled flight. But MMT hasn't made the refund. They don't give any reply. Customer service talk all nonsense. When I called #airindia they told that Make my tip hasn't made any refund application. This is new India. Failed agencies like this is stealing customers money without any fear. As a customer we don't have any forum. Please stay away from Make my trip. My mb no. Is 9007107921.

Also, it is clearly MakeMyTrip's responsibility that the details mentioned on the website should be correct you can fool people by saying that it depends on the hotel what they will provide in the package. If that is the case you should mention it in the booking page. Use an disclaimer and let the users know before they end up paying 5000 extra for something that they will never get. This is MakeMyTrip's responsibility towards their customers.",5

704,"I have been dealing with them for a very long time spending lakhs of rupees and booking tickets and hotels in India and US and Canada.I had booked tickets last year before Covid for Canada and the flight was cancelled and I had insurances which I paid for and rescheduled the flight, till date I am just waiting for this people to respond and refund my money back. The worst part is that when I call them which is nearly impossible to get through their customer care and if I get a representative they will blame the airline saying they have to initiate request  and when I contact the airline they say contact your agent ….I would just request people to stop making any bookings from make my trip as they don't care about their existing customers or people who had booked with them earlier and they only have representatives to assist with new bookings.Horrible Is not the word to describe them ….they don't understand people who are working abroad and stuck here due to lock down with no jobs and support from our government .they should prioritize the refunds as people can use their money to manage their expenses .",3
705,We booked an outstation cab for an weekend trip to Landsdowne. You have no means to contact anyone...they share cab details in the last minute and are not sure if the cab will ever arrive...the driver was sleeping while driving and talking to his girlfriend over phone continuously....they even charged so much extra money...it was the worst experience ever...please never book outstation cabs from make my trip!!,1
706,We have booked an over villa beach resort in Saii Lagoon Curio Collection by Hilton Maldives from MakeMyTrip website as we thought it was the best deal given by MakeMyTrip than other website. We got confirmation mail from MakeMyTrip that king size over beach villa confirmed. As we got the confirmation from MakeMyTrip we have planned our trip and we have booked international flight tickets. But one week before the trip we recieved call from MakeMyTrip there was a room mapping issue cancel your booking and rebook it again. Then we got doubt and cross checked with hotel they confirmed that king size room near to beach not over water villa is confirmed by your travel agent. We were shocked very angry and very upset with MakeMyTrip...For that actual price we were getting only beach villa not over water beach villa. Because of MakeMyTrip negligence we lost nearly 50k rs to and fro flight ticket charges...MakeMyTrip is just fooling the customers for there benefits.Never believe there deals and get trap in them.. They are not even responding properly on the issue..,5

709,"I would like to give ZERO star to this hotel. I visited this hotel on Friday 12th March 2021 and checked out from the hotel on 15th March 2021 and mistakenly i forgot my Zara coat worth 5K in the hotel room which was a gift from my husband for my anniversary. Upon realizing that i left my coat in the hotel while doing unpacking, i called the landline number available on their sites and found that none of them are working. Somehow i managed to contact the hotel and asked them to courier my belonging back to me, on which they bluntly said that they dont have any of my belonging with them and courier service they dont provide. Upon requesting so many times, they called back and said that they dont have the coat and cant do anything now. This is one of the worst experience i would say. I have travelled many other countries and places in India and never ever faced such an issue, but with this hotel, despite of ignoring the bad linen and dirty bathrooms, i lost my precious stuff and ignorant and poor management. I would like to request all to think twice before visiting this hotel as the management is not friendly at all and just in case if you forget anything in the hotel room, you will loose it forever. Not to forget, during the covid time, there was no sanitization in the rooms, and they left the dirty clothes in the room, door knobs were dirty and broken bathroom handles.",1

Issue maybe for one hour or one day it's one week now the tickets are costlier they want us to book by ourself in the initial stages of tour itself they are causing headache..i don't know how to handle the whole tour be alert with such frauds..,1

Due to COVID-19, Lockdown was declared from 23.Mar.2020. Indigo flight no. 6E769, which was supposed to be taking off from Lucknow AIrport at 0555 hrs on 23.Mar.2020 got cancelled due to the COVID-19 travel restriction imposed by Govt. of India. I got the cancelled flight message from Indigo Airlines in my Email. on 22.Mar.2020 at 06:22 PM. My travel plan was urgent to attend a medical emergency of my family member at Vadodara Therefore, I booked another flight for my journey. I started chasing my refund of the cancelled flight by E.mail to Make My Trip and Indigo. Mail Correspondence Dates are as follows. 13.Apr.2020  Time: 09:30 PM 14.Apr.2020  Time: 08:54 PM 23.Apr.2020  Time: 01:23 AM 30.Dec.2020  Time: 05:18 PM 16.Jan.2020  Time: 02:23 PM 18.Jan.2020  Time: 09:11 PM Response Received from Make My Trip on the following dates. Md Iqbaluddin responds 1st time on 18.Jan.08:33 PM Aritrica Chakraborty responds 2nd time on 19.Jan.06:49 PM saying that, my refund request is in process and soon I will get the refund. Finally, I received a mail from Make My Trip on Mar 3, 2021, at 4:34 AM saying that - A refund of ₹362 has been processed. The refund Calculation received from Make My Trip is given below. Total Paid- ₹ 7, 009 Airline Fare -₹ 6, 714 MMT Convenience Fee -₹ 290 Donation Amount-₹ 5 - Deductions- ₹ 6, 642 Airline Cancellation Fee - ₹ 6, 352 MMT Convenience Fee- ₹ 290 Here, I want to ask to Make My Trip and Indigo Airlines that, 1- When the flight is cancelled due to the COVID-19 travel restriction imposed by Govt. of India, why are you penalising me by deducting ₹ 6, 642 of my hard-earned money. 2- Customer is the culprit, whatever be the situation, Make My trip don't want to lose his share. It is clearly visible, Make My Trip has charged ₹ 290 as MMT Convenience Fee while booking the ticket and again has charged ₹ 290 as MMT Convenience Fee in the name of cancellation of the ticket. I would like to mention here that, I have not cancelled any tickets. The flight was cancelled due to the COVID-19 travel restriction imposed by Govt. of India. For what reason, Make My Trip is shocking my blood like a vampire. 3- I appeal to MakeMyTrip,   and Indigo Airlines that, I don't want a refund of  ₹362. The way you both have stolen my hard-earned ₹ 6, 352, Please keep ₹362 with you and divide it in the ratio of 50:50 among yourself(₹ 181 each). 4- I recommend Mr. Modi, to please award Bharat Ratna to these two peoples for looting common men hard-earned money without any reason.",1
715,"In my opinion, the real character of a person, or a company is not judged by how well they treat you in your good times, but by how they deal with you in case of any issue on emergency. We had booked a trip to Goa with MMT recently. We were a group of 6 people so we thought that booking my MMT shall make our travel hassle free. The flights we chose was Indigo, and Radisson Candolim was our hotel. Unfortunately around 10 days before the trip my father in law(who stays with us) had to be hospitalised and was admitted to the ICU because of a serious medical condition. We were in a panicky situation and too occupied mentally and physically. I contacted with my MMT Relationship Officer to reschedule(not cancel) my trip to a date which was 20 days after the original travel date. I mailed her with the details and supportive documents(Hospital ICU Admission Slip and PAN Card of my Wife - to establish the relationship with the patient). She forwarded our request to MMT, which was outrightly rejected, even when it was on Medical Grounds with proper proofs. As a result, the complete booking amount(which was close to 1 lakh Rs.) was lost. Money might not be the biggest of my concern but the lack of empathy which MMT showed in this situation just spoilt my mood and the trust I had with MMT. Never ever will I regain my faith in MMT, and won’t ever recommend anyone to book their travel via MMT.",1
716,"They are fully dependent on Chatbot and a system with bugs. They do not have any direct contact for manual intervention, neither email nor a phone number. I was harassed for refunding a flight ticket, which was cancelled by the airlines' company itself. Their system could not sense the cancellation of the flight and was not giving me a refund.  The chatbot has limited formatted dialogue. I was very frustrated. My problem was solved at last by the intervention of the consumer helpline site, hosted by Govt. of India. #myopinion",1
717,"I travel a lot and this is the first time I went with a package tour because of time constraints. I had the worst experience with MakeMyTtrip. Very disappointed with our your point of contact/representative. She made us wait on the road for hours while we wait for a resolution. I sent emails, text messages and phone calls. There was no acknowledgement. Thank god it's just two adults. Cant imagine dealing with this kind of customer service with a bigger family and kids. I paid for last minute new hotel reservations because hotels provided ads part of the package were uncomfortable to stay and not necessarily bad. Customer service has no empathy towards customers when they express a concern. I have no faith on getting refunds for the services I did not use. Please take some time to plan your trip, itinerary and hotel reservations. Dont involve third parties like MakeMyTrip. You will have hard time dealing with it.",1
718,I have had serious issues in getting information about my refund process. The worst thing about MMT is that there is no feedback option. The  lines are either too busy or they are based on regular issues. It is almost impossible to get to a customer service person if your issue is peculiar . I would certainly not recommend MMT for international bookings,1
719,"Worst hotel service that one could get on honeymoon I never expected this from MMT. Totally money fraud and money scammers I must say. We had chosen 3 star hotel for our entire journey but it wasn't even single star. Jaipur, jodhpur hotel were so miserable. Property owners doesn't even bother to sweep the room. We clearly observed dust and hairs on the floor. I mean seriously in this crucial time of covid-19. How can a hotel be so irresponsible. Jodhpur hotel was not even for single star. They didn't provide us basis amenities.",1

As per the flight company VISTARA's policy I should have got my 100% refund by MMT is now refusing to refund the same. they do not care about customer's time and money and are slow in following the defined SLA. It takes ages to get in touch with the customer care of MMT and if by chance you get through the customer care number you will have to explain the case over and over again as ""Transfer of internal call is not possible"" I fail to understand how one can get the query resolved from such people. Incase someone senior and responsible can help on this issue I request your support.",1

MakeMy Trips's customer care is useless, initially, I was unable to even reach them. In the haste, I called up the airline, Vergin Atlantic and they said either they will refund or give another option of connecting flight with the delay of 7 hours whcih was still OK. But after contacting Make My trip teh replied there is no option fo that sort.(TRANSPARENCY) don't expect from MakeMy Trip . Then I was given and option to refund by trimming 100$ service fees which I did not avail as the cancellation was not from my side. Still went ahead with the refund option. I am waiting on my refund form last 4 months now. The message says it is under Vergic Atlantic approval queue. After calling Vergin Atlantic they said it has been approved long back and my money has been sent to Make My trip already. Lesson Learned AVOID TRAVEL AGENT SERVICES LIKE MAKE MY TRIP AND TRAVEL O POD Go direct to the airline site. with the Airlines you as much safer there and assured Interestingly I did had a good experience till 2020 with MakeMy Trip as was able to locate the customer care and people were polite and transparent, now be is not the case.

Every attempt at talking to someone sends me back to the website(WHICH IS GIVING THE WRONG INFO). I used to be a faithful user of makemytrip for many years, but, this is a really bad experience.

They where not ready to accept the mistakes even after sharing the pictures of there dirty hotel manager of hotel Narayan asked a question to me “you will find mask in roads too so what you will do u adjust and move off right?” So this shows his behaviour and customer interaction. After paying amount for hotel we shd get free corona frm this mask. He was so arrogant to guest and started blaming us for showing mask and dirty things of hotel and changed his words every time he said we where room for long time before asking front desk when I said I have video recording from the time I enter and till now and voice recording of our conversation and asked him to show cc tv footage with time when I was near Helpdesk or in parking for 4hrs he doesn’t have cctv Working in hotel , it’s again a security concern for the guest.

737,"This is regarding the MakeMyTrip Kerala trip package'NL2100252468954'. The package included booking of a 4 star hotel'The Lake View resort' Munnar for 2 nights(25th & 26th Dec) . This hotel was suggested by a MakeMyTrip agent only(namely Neha), who helped with various quotations and booking. The hotel was sold out and unavailable, which the hotel sales agent communicated to MakeMyTrip on the next day 22nd Dec morning itself. MakeMyTrip missed the communication from the hotel and didn't let us know on the same. As a result we were denied check-in, after arriving at the resort on 25th Dec evening 6:00 pm. We then reached out to the assigned Relationship Officer(namely Vijayalakshmi), who then in coordination with MakeMyTrip backend team took 2 hours to book another hotel(Hill View), but a 3 star one. Next day we need to check out from there too, and after follow-up again with Vijayalakshmi, the next  2 star hotel(Emerald Inn) was booked. For both days, we were charged for a 4 star hotel, and were degraded to 3 star and 2 star hotel. The MakeMyTrip Relationship Officer and team were fully incompetent, unprofessional and mismanaged in supporting the issues and we have to constantly follow-up with them, instead of they proactively taking care of our trip and issues with hotel booking. Because of this we lost time and it ruined our honeymoon stay at Munnar. Another guy called Akshay fro MakeMyTrip called us during these issues with our Munnar stay, but instead of supporting us he was nagging with his own MakeMyTrip issues and charges. No break-up of costs provided, and charged us higher(for 4 star) for hotels booked for 3 star and 2 star. No refunds initiated. We are very disappointed, completely unhappy and unsatisfied with the services and support provided by MakeMyTrip, and won't recommend anyone to avail MakeMyTrip travel package.",1

And they said that according to their refund Policy My expected refund date is 5th Feb. For 6 months my hard earned amount of above 10000 rupees is with them.

740,"I booked a flight from Lucknow to kochi via Bangalore which was cancelled by the airline. The airline returned the complete amount but when it came to MMT, they took almost a month to just generate the refund(I am yet to get my money) but got 2 invoices for the same with different amount and sadly both of them do not have the full refund paid by the airline. Below is the breakup of the flight Total paid to MMT - 10, 038 Airline fare - 9448 MMT convenience fee - 480 Insurance - 838 Donation - 10 Discount - 738 Ideally, apart from convenience fee and Donations everything else should have been refunded. But they have deducted Convenience+ Insurance+  Discount from the total paid amount. So according to the invoice 1, I am getting 8710 after all their deductions and loosing around rs.1318 on my total paid amount. The second tax invoice which I received from MMT is funnier. There is no mention of the any total amount paid, deductions or any amount paid by the airline. It shows the below details Fare charges - 8547(which is wrong) Insurance fees - 0(again wrong) MMT service charge - 406(Not sure for what service) GST - 113 Total refund - 7809 When I try to reach out to their customer care through email, I am redirected to Manage my booking page from where I cannot go anywhere. They even do not have a dedicated line/email to address any queries and misleading the customers through their automated system which is a total joke as it pops up as 24X7 support. I would NOT recommend anyone to ever book flights through MMT and suggest to book directly from the airline since it is genuine and you will also get quick refund without any unnecessary deductions. For me it was my fault to fell in MMT trap as I had some points left(Discount 738) from my previous(2016) hotel booking which I wanted to get rid of.",1

Well it took me 15 minutes by taxi to reach the hotel. Definitely the makemytrip has no sense of units and completely misleads people. The price that they quote is not correct. They quote one price and the hotel charges far more than that. Then the hotel will not give the bill. On flight booking Makemytrip offered flight with only 7kg baggage allownace. On the direct booking with the airlines, they offered 15 kg baggage allowance at the same price. Long story short - don't bother look into this website.",1

Poor planning from MMT, booked our holidays during Sat/Sun even though we gave 10 days flexibility on dates.  Many of the Himachal exhibits/shops were closed during Sat & Sundays from Covid start. Wrong calculation by your team on commuting from Chandigarh as 6-8 hours, but really took 11+ hours, due to this we've reached Manali on the 2nd day evening itself. We have to stay on the highway, as suggested by the driver and security is compromised. MMT RO advised us to book on our own by making separate payments. Also not informed the earlier booked hotel and rent is wasted, can't claim refund also. Vehicle condition is not good, half a day wasted in vehicle repair work. Driver not heard our thoughts, preferred village routes to avoid toll, resulted in travel sickness. Also the driver forced us to take Rafting/Paragliding for his monetary benefits. He stopped the vehicle even long before the exhibits and needed to walk a lot in bad weather/slippery surfaces. Lot of stress is added due to this. I'll not avail any service in MMT future and won't recommend it to any friends and Family.",1

There's no option available on their site to lodge a complaint. There's a chatbot though, that asks you to call the helpline numbers and the numbers have robotic voices asking you to go to the website! Hah! good business policy!

I DID NOT PUT ANY CANCELLATION REQUEST. I received the message at around Midnight, but I still tried calling them. The customer care is complete and utter nonsense. All I got was automated responses and there was no way for me to reach their customer executive. I have no idea how shall I reach them, as I have tried every possible way I could think of. Even after sending them an Email I got an automated response to fill in their webform(which did not exist because they cancelled my flight.) This seems to be a very elaborate SCAM by MMT.

They should first consult with me whether I am comfortable with this changes in my flight or not. and the other thing is if I have done booking for direct flight, means I don't want any connecting flight.

766,"I just had a very bad experience with Makemytrip. I had booked my flight ticket on 18th September 2020 from Dubai to Ahmedabad. I had paid for the ticket via Credit Card. After booking a ticket, I had requested to get the bill/Invoice from Makemytrip.com but it seems like only the robot is working in Makemytrip. I was just requesting the bill / Invoice for my payment and they were replying like just get in touch with Spicejet to get the bill. I said that I paid the money to Makemytrip then why I should get the bill/invoice from Spicejet, then they were only replying like this is our company procedure. It is like you buy a Britania biscuit from any small store or supermarket, you pay the money at the counter and when you ask for a bill for your payment, the supermarket executive saying to contact Britania Company to get the bill. Are you crazy? When I have started taking continuous follow up then they said that you can only get the bill after your flight as per company policy. When I told them this is not an accounting standard, they did not have an answer. As per Makemytrip logic, if you buy Head & Shoulder Shampoo from Supermarket then you will get the bill only after you use the entire shampoo. Are you kidding me? Then they were saying that all the company is following this procedure .When I said only Makemytrip is following this as I had proof for another booking on Goibibo and Yatra then they did not have an answer. As per Makemytrip logic, If you are taking any IBPS/IPS exam class or any other Exam Class and paying for these classes then you will get the bill of payment after giving the exam only. Not before that. I was about to become mental of this logic. There is no way to reach to customer care executive. The only robot is replying to any query. It took 2 hours to get in touch with the customer care executive. Customer Care executive does not know anything about the problem and replies the same answer given by the company SOP. They were annoying me when I started calling again and again as there were not having an answer and did not want to give a solution to the customer. Giving a wrong commitment like my manager will call in one hour, we will send the mail, etc. But they were not replying on time. It is our right to get the bill/Invoice when we pay the amount to any company . When someone is denying to give you the bill/Invoice, there is something wrong with that person or company. Might be there are not doing legal business or not paying tax. This my personal experience. I can show the proof also of Makemytrip irresponsible reply. Just visit the Makemytrip to compare the price. Do not book from their app or website as they are not doing legal business.",1

The way they structured online and phone support is that customers cannot reach them and they can avoid paying refunds to the customers. You will be stuck up if you make a booking with them.

Below are few concerns that I faced with MMT: 1) I did not receive any support from MMT when we requested to waive off the Airlines cancellation fee. It was us who broke our head with Airlines several times(from March 2020 till date) to cancel the flight. 2) MMT without any hesitation told us to contact the Airlines by ourselves and resolve the issue with them directly. If I don't get basic support from MMT why should we pay convenience fees to MMT 3) When a user books a flight/ hotel/ etc. using a travel agency like MMT, It means that my point of contact should be with the Travel Agency and the travel agency should not ask us to get in touch with Airlines. 4) When I tried to contact MMT there was no way I could talk to a customer executive because none of the phone numbers are working.

It's not the first time they are troubling their customers, earlier also there has been many such cases, they are defaming the name of Travel Agency by giving wrong info, false promises due to which clients have to suffer later on along with reputation of Such agencies also getting spoiled due to MMT's fault.

803,"Complaint: 2.Since the lock down was extended by Government of India, Indigo people intimated me about the cancellation.  and intimated that they have kept in credit shell. As I did not want the money with airlines people, because of the illogical condition the money should be used for same persons(Since there is no guarantee the same person will be alive for one year) I had a chat with “make my trip” people and then I had a chat with indigo people on 22.4.2020  and requested for a refund. 4.They have promptly sent the credit note to “make my trip” people. I do not know whether they have transferred the amount to make my trip people. 5.When I had chat with make my trip people on 6th may, and On 7th may  the “make my trip” people were not at all listening to me. 6.I again wrote an email to “Make my trip” people. and there came a reply to chat with them across which can be solved. 7.Again, I contacted the indigo people and they said they cannot do anything as they have transferred the amount to make my trip people. Thereafter, finally I had a chat with make my trip people yesterday(10th May 2020). I did raise the new claim(deliberately) because there was no response from “make my trip” people for my mails and chats. Yesterday that is 11th May 2020 in the morning, I called “make my trip” people and after 30 minutes of waiting, one gentle man came online. He was speaking to me politely, but was telling me to wait for some more time. It is already 55days that my credit note issued by indigo, now they are asking me to for some more time. How much time should I wait? I finally said I will take up with consumer forum. I request you to kindly redress my grievance. Please. V.Sekharan.",1

However, I managed to whatzapp and get the contact email ID myself and wrote to the hotel. the Hotel in charge responded saying they will cancel the booking but the money is still with MMT(they have not paid the hotel) and so I have to ask MMT to refund the money. This seems to be deliberate malafide intent from MMT .I have called them on the helpline number twice and chatted with them 5 times but get the same excuse everytime that they are not able to reach the hotel, which is blatantly false. I also forwarded the email to them and asked to talk to a supervisor or manager but have not received any call back as yet.",3

But for the last 45 days I am getting a response that I would be contacted for my future bookings within 21 days. When I call the customer support it gets transferred to an IVR and does not answer any querry. Infact it requests us to use the website. The chatbot on their site is horrible. Understands only the prefed querries. In April suddenly my ticket automatically shifted from cancelled to confirmed. So my request to keep the ticket open were never answered. Now again I have requested. Lufthansa has decided to give credit vouchers. So why is it not being conveyed to us? Very disappointed with makemytrip.,1

Hence I had cancelled the ticket from SpiceJet. The ticket is still available with MakeMy trip.com.  Hence the amount is with them.  They are not refunding the amount and also not responding to my query. I think they are enjoying at home with the money that people have paid them.  They are number one fraud company. I will suggest that never use MakeMy tip to book your flight / rail tickets nor do a hotel booking using their site.,1

Rather than acting as responsible company they are oppotunist during this unprecedented times.

819,"I approached MMT to plan my honeymoon for Dec’19 to avoid the hassle of booking, transportation service, etc. This turned out to be a very big mistake and at the end of it all, I felt extremely stupid to handover the planning of my honeymoon to the highly irresponsible, insensitive, unorganized and mismanaged team at MMT. So, this is how my agonizing trip panned out from selecting the honeymoon location to the last day of my honeymoon trip which was supposed to be an exquisite surprise for my husband i.e. honeymoon trip to Mauritius for 6 days and 7 nights. 1.I got in touch with MMT representative Ajay Sharma to discuss the itinerary for Switzerland on 22nd July 2019. Although, he quickly responded through an email and had a discussion over a call while I being in Australia considering time zone difference. After a few email exchanges and changes in honeymoon destination(to Bali), he stopped responding to my emails. I was very much keen to book considering I was planning the trip during Christmas time. 26th July was my last email to him where I received absolutely no response(first disappointment from MMT). 2.I requested my sister to reach out to MMT India since she was in India and it could be easier for her to coordinate. We contact Vinnie Singla on 6th August 2019 and she was quite helpful in getting through the bookings and package options. We booked 6 nights 7 Days to Mauritius at Hotel Radisson Blu Poste Lafayette Resort and Spa; Superior Ocean room for 3.31Lakhs. Package included – Tickets+ private Pick and drop service+Free breakfast+ Dinner+ Honeymoon freebies – 1 fruits platter+ Sparkling wine+ flower arrangement on day 1+ Candlelight dinner on the seaside. 3.We received several follow-up calls for the payment and the amount was paid on time without any delay. I and my husband were very excited about our first trip together not knowing that it would a memorable one but rather due to disappointing experiences. 4.Day 1 – 27 Dec Travel to Mauritius; No problem in landing in Mauritius. A private car picked us up as planned. On arriving at the hotel, I had informed the Raddison team presenting the Hotel Confirmation Voucher given by MMT that we have freebies as per the package(Honeymoon freebies 1 fruit platter, 1 bottle of sparkling wine and flower arrangement upon on arrival). However, nothing was done on the arrival(second disappointment from MMT). The hotel staff was welcoming. The room(1003) allocated to us was really small compared to the one shown on the site. When we requested whether we can change the accommodation with a bigger one we were told we will be given another room in the building behind which is not beach facing. Mind you the package cost was high just because of Beach facing room and I was told by MMT in case you don’t like the room we will ensure to get it changed(Third disappointment from MMT) 5.Day 2 – 28th Dec Trip to North tour.  We hired a car with a driver from Radisson hotel Mr. Neale was very polite during the journey and throughout the whole day, we were very much aligned to the timelines allotted by him. We had some sightseeing as per the north tour itinerary and at the end of the day, we picked some fruits from the local mall and told Mr. Neal we should be back once we are done. We were only 5 -10 mins over due to a long queue for billing. On this, he started showing a bit of frustration that he has been delayed for his next pick-up due to us. Once we reached the hotel and I gave him the money on the tour with some request for negotiation which he did not do it. Surprisingly, he wasn’t getting late during this whole time for his next pick-up and also promised that he will be available for tomorrow’s trip and gave his phone number. When we reached the hotel, our room was not cleaned and we had to request the reception to clean it. We expect a 4-star hotel to do these basic things as a part of their routine(first disappointment from Radisson) 6.Day 3 – 29th Dec We were ready for our today’s South tour to begin at 10 AM and went to the reception to check on Mr. Neal’s arrival. Since we didn’t find him and his car at the reception on inquiring to the reception, they informed me that he is on leave today. We tried calling him several times but received no response. We then finally get a response from him saying he has some personal issues and can’t turn up. By this, we already lost morning time which was meant to utilize in travel to sightseeing placed. We requested reception to book another car but, we were informed later that we can’t do any sightseeing because of a cyclone that has hit several parts of Mauritius and unfortunately, we couldn’t do any activity that due to cyclone. 7.Day 4 – 30th Dec No activity due to cyclone. I appreciate the hotel staff has arranged some activity but the food served was very pathetic with very bad service. The pizza that we ordered for lunch came only after 30 mins and had no proper toppings on it. We had to call the staff to show them what they have served and requested them to give pizza with proper toppings. The buffet too was not so appealing and not worth the money that was paying for per plate(Second disappointment from Radisson hotel). 8.Day 5 – 31st Dec The cyclone warning was removed at around noon. But, because of many sightseeing places were impacted, sightseeing places were shut down and no car was available as well. I tried reaching MMT’s representative in Mauritius(Sea Side Holidays) for some car arrangement but, they didn’t help us either in booking any car or any tour for the rest of the day. I requested the representative to pre-book a car for the 1st Jan trip at least and requested them whether they can arrange a short tour on our departure day to which he initially agreed. But, later asked me to contact MMT representative instead as the tour was not in my package which was fair enough. During this too and fro coordination, I reached out to reception for a car(as a backup plan) for next day tour. While conversing with this arrangement, I also informed the reception that we haven’t been given any freebees yet(candlelight dinner by sea side+ 1 fruit platter, Sparkling wine, Flower arrangement on arrival). They indicated they haven’t been informed by MMT that we were honeymooners! After checking with MMT representative Pooja Anurag Bansal, she said she already reached out to reception at the start of the trip and informed them about honeymoon freebies. She also is on leave couldn’t continue the support and handed over the case to someone else called Abhishek. My whole experience of the journey so far was to explain my concerns to Radisson staff, different MMT representatives with no positive outcome. It was absolute mismanagement from MMT. Firstly, they followed up so much for payment but when the payment was done, they were least bothered to see how their client’s experience was during the journey. This was the biggest disappointment. After showing the obvious unhappiness with the staff and arrangement we were served a fruit platter and a sparkling wine and we were told that the Radisson staff has arranged a free south tour next day and a candle night dinner for 1st Jan as compensation from their side for the mismanagement that happened and we can leave with a better experience. Out of all this, I and my husband specifically were so disappointed that he didn’t touch the fruit platter at all which had pieces of small ripped pineapple and few biscuits. Day 6 – 01st Jan Since we had already paid for departure pick up in the package, I had requested MMT to arrange a short tour at 9 AM with the same car which will pick us up at 5 PM for which I was ready to pay the extra cost. With just one day left, I was still reaching out on the status of my request to MMT representative Abhishek. I gave them my husband’s number as my phone was not reachable. When we missed their call, we tried reaching them in several instances but they never responded back. We were later told by another representative that Abhishek is on leave and some other guy has taken the case. By this time I had explained all the issues and request to so many people that I had reached my frustration level to the extreme. 9.Day 7 – 02nd Jan Departure day: No response from MMT still. Extremely disappointed. We used our back-up plan of hiring a car from Radisson reception for a short tour and then departing to the airport. Throughout the day we received not a single call from MMT on the request that I made nor using the drop service at 5 PM from Hotel. Overall highly unpleasant experience with MMT.",2

824,Due to the prevailing condition airlines have cancelled flilghts.  Makemytrip.com has chosen to cut all their communication channels. You cannot call them on phone.  Only IVR and calls are cut.  They bounce your email message with an autho reply.  Their online chat MYRA gives only auto responses. A helpless passenger who has purchased international tickets worth lakhs of rupees is denied refund.  The airline has sanctioned full refund.  Makemytrip will not listen to the customer and refund the money.   They have already got the money for online ticket sale and they have no concern for the passenger.  Very sad. They have taken the pandemic as an excuse to deny refund of tickets.,1

If infection happens to the passengers who tried to cancel their ticket due to #covid19 situation, it should directly be blamed to these companies, India will never progress until these kind of companies, these kind of deeds, action towards their customers is legal. Shame on you #makeMyTrip and yes I agree with other reviews here written about the same cause, let these companies suffer with #covid19 themselves as they don't seem to give a s about the situation.",3

828,Hey Guys! This is to get this very important point under out notice. I have booked my flights with #makemytrip and the airline is #indigoairlines Due to the Corona effect and also Our Honorable PM's Advise I have decided to cancel the flight last moment. I first called indigo to understand how they would be able to help me out and after almost 40 min of wait one representative answered my call and explained me the refund process which was a minimum refund. And also Indigo told me they won't be able to cancel and I should be contacting Makemytrip directly. When I reached out to makemytrip after almost 30 minutes of wait my call was answered and the agent clearly said that there would be zero refund. On clearly mentioning that indigo has confirmed the refund they denied it and kept me on hold again. I was on a hold for almost 60 min and the call dropped. The point I am trying to make here is that#corona is a serious issue and when Indian Railways is giving full refund then why can't these private companies give the refund. Shouldn't they be responsible enough in helping the customer or is this the right time to take advantage of situation and loot money from people. Please help me understand how are these people in any way into losses? They are not rather they would be making more money by not providing any services. I REQUEST EVERYONE TO PLEASE SHARE THIS AND LET'S MAKE THESE GIANTS REALIZE THEIR MISTAKES AND RESPONSIBILITY.,1

They are not even responding properly to my mails or call. The worse part is when the whole world is advising you to not travel and stay safe, the make my trip executives lie through their teeth.

Also received an email from Make my trip on this confirmation followed by an email credit note from Go Air confirming the payment being made to make my trip. It has been almost 2 months since I received the confirmation from Go-Air but no refund from make my trip. Attached confirmation of flight cancellation from Go-Air and email acknowledgement of refund initiation by make my trip,1
844,"First time I booked international flight booking(Europe) thru' Makemytrip. Bought travel insurance along with the flight ticket. But VFS office did not accept the insurance policy for my Schengen visa application as my passport number was not printed in the policy generated by Makemytrip. Tried to call their customer(s)care numbers several times from VFS office, but the response I could get was ""All our travel agents are busy, please wait"" repeatedly for half-an-hour. Due to short of time to submit visa documents, I purchased a new insurance policy from another vendor at the VFS premises. Later I sent e-mail to the insurance company to cancel and refund the premium amount, they promptly replied I have to approach makemytrip as they only generated the policy. I sent e-mail to makemytrip but received their automated reply to their ""Trips"" section or click on the link provided in a separate e-mail to directly chat with their CSA. But no separate e-mail nor the link. I tried calling all their customer service several times one by one for next two days, but always got the automated message ""All our travel agents are busy."". Each call I disconnected in frustration after hearing this repeated message for more than half hour. Third day I tried their numbers from my breakfast time till lunch time and in one of the calls I pressed the option for ""New Flight Ticket"" instead of ""Existing Ticket"" and I got their CSA almost immediately. I explained the problem to her in the existing ticket, she said she will transfer to concerned team and back to square one, with same ""All our CSAs are busy."" music. Finally one such call I left the speaker phone on for more than half hour, then I heard someone saying ""Hello"". I explained the problem to him and he said he will take up with the concerned department who will call me within 48 hours. I am waiting for their call as I can only wait in the best hope. Let's see what happens. But what is frustrating to the core is that I cannot effectively complain to them pointing their mistake as they always direct me to go to online support where there is no pre-defined option that explains my problem. Their CSA will not come on chat or phone because they are busy 247 for other customers, except when you try ""Buy a new ticket"" then you will get their CSA instantly. To sum up, their service is HORRIBLE",1

846,"Your customer care helpline not working, neither your people responding my email! Even I DM my issue to you but as usual not hearing back. I was assured of refund within 48 hours but 48 days has passed! Should I copy paste chain of emails here to show how you stopped replying? Worst of it is for last 3 days you changed helpline number and I guess you forget to fix it because ""NOBODY IS PICKING UP THE PHONE""!",1
847,"Ref:NL2201072286160 - Pathetic Service by MMT Makemytrip I have just completed a holiday booked thru MMT. My relationship manager Ms. Vibha Chopra. It was a very bad experience even after paying all money in advance. The holiday was a land tour with hotels and private Cab from 16 Feb to 21 Feb booked and paid in advance. As promised by my agent, No one from MMT Makemytripreceived me at the airport and no local SIM was provided. I had to borrow a SIM from Cab driver instead. The hotel quality at Bentota was not 4 star or even 3 star. I had a stained toilet seat, dirty grey looking towels, no toiletries except cheap looking soap and shampoo. The tea making facility was bad. Just a plate, tea bags, sugar and 2 cups. No tray, spoons. Service was bad as well. When I asked for a spoon for stirring multiple times, I got it after 30 mnts or so. I am attaching the photos from this hotel. Hotel at Kandy and Colombo were booked with a twin beds for a couple and not double bed as required by me. Most frustrating part was that I was charged for a drop on the last day -21 Feb. But there was no Cab available for this. I had dropped multiple messages to MMT - Ms. Vibha and Mr. Chandan about it. Also contacted their local service provider Apple Holidays But as usual no response from any one of them. I had to finally take a local Cab from hotel, which costed me a hefty amount. Promt response from MMT agent was a big issue as I never got a prompt response even when I could see that the agent was online on WhatsApp. She was just not responding to my messages. Later I just got either excuses or that some one elsewill contact me. Which also never happened. She dropped 2-3 names and I am still to get a call from them. I wrote a formal complaint on 23 Feb. I got a call and a promise to resolve it within 48 hrs. But shocking that next call I got was on 31 Feb that too the person did not have any idea about my travel dates and issues and that I kept reminding them everyday on Twitter and in email. They take your money in advance and do not bother to provide a service. Their local agent Apple Holidays was the same. Pathetic service and cheating the customer. I have been writing to their customer service and even Mr. Deep Kalra, CEO at deep.kalra@makemytrip.com but even he does not respond. This cheating is by design to loot the public who ever comes to their site Think twice before booking any trip thru MMT or anything if you want a good service.",1
848,"Very rude staff, they take advance money as they know if anyone will visit for on the spot booking, no one will waste their money in staying in the hotel. Food quality was bad, rooms was not properly maintain.",1
849,"I was trying to book a ticket online for my parents. I was receiving a really good offer and an additional offer for using Citibank card! I was sitting aborad trying to help my parents! Since the payment didn't go through due to an incorrect CVV no. They immediately called my parents and ticked them into paying higher charges for the ticket. Additionally, they did not apply the discount for using Citibank card! Very Very pathetic customer service and a bunch of cheats! never ever use them again!",1
850,"I am writing to you regarding my father’s travel to Thailand. To give you a background, I wanted to book a group tour package for my father (preferably a beach location in India) and called up MakeMyTrip for that. The customer care executive seemed very committed and suggested a trip to Thailand for my father. After much convincing, I agreed as the pricing and duration worked out fine for me. But my special request was, assistance for my father as he is a senior citizen (with limited communication skills in English) and this is his first international travel. But the customer care executive assured me that everything would be taken care of and I have nothing to worry about. I chose MakeMyTrip for its credibility and assurance. But to my horror, my father was left stranded at the Bangkok airport for almost 4 hours without any information. After multiple failed attempts to connect to the tour manager, he messaged/called me seeking for help. Fortunately, I had ISD activated on my phone and was able to make calls to Thailand and spoke to the Freddy and later Victoria asking for help to assist my dad. Victoria was helpful in resolving the issue and met with my father and re-worked his itinerary and confirmed the same to me over messages. This issue was caused due to incorrect arrival date being updated at the Thailand head office of MakeMyTrip, which was the fault of the booking agent, but my father and I had to bear the brunt of it. The trip, that was supposed to be 4 days-3 nights was now only 3 days-2 nights which is not fair for the kind of money that I paid. I can’t request for an extended day of the trip for my father as he is already scheduled to travel back tonight. In spite of knowing everything and after multiple calls/messages, the customer care executive (with whom I was in touch with) did not reverted since 24th Dec morning (which is unacceptable) and I didn't hear back from him for the next two days. I requested compensation for the loss that I incurred and the mental, emotional and physical trauma/ stress that not only my father, but even I had to undergo. After multiple follow ups from my side, they confirmed after one month they will refund some money and it will credited in 7-10 days. It's been one month now, and still the money is not refunded. What kind of customer service is this? Just pathetic.",4
851,"Make My Trip website has give facilities for finding hotel deals along with flights.

If you do not have a date related problem, then this is a good way to get a flight on a better fare. Thanks.",1
852,No support from customer care to cancel the ticket. they are not updating the status of refund. very bad service,1

But when I reached hotel, I am told that no room is booked in your name. When I called Make my trip support, they simple said ""Sorry"" and said no hotel available to check-in in the area. I was in bizarre condition as due to festival season all hotels were fully occupied and with me was my wife and 4 years kid. Somehow managed to take shelter in outskirt of city.

856,"I've recently visited this hotel with my parents on 15th Feb - 17th Feb, 2020 and the rooms are very expensive. The hotel staff can't speak any other language other than Tamil. The hotel staff are good when we take the rooms, but when we approach them for any service related, they are very rude to you and doesn't bother about our concerns. There are lot of issues when we took the room there, starting from lights not working in the room, phone wasn't working, the mirror in the room is full of rust, the furniture is broken. They don't provide newspapers at all. They don't provide water bottles until we request them many times. They don't provide or change bed sheets at all. In the bathroom shower doesn't work at all, taps are broken, water flow from the taps are very slow and narrow. The ac in the room doesn't work properly. Bed are torn and have bed bugs. The hotel staff argue and quarrel with us as we approached them with these issues, and they discriminate a lot when they know we don't speak in Tamil. I request all people visiting Rameswaram not to take rooms here. Smoking is not allowed outside the rooms, but many people smoke at the entrance of their rooms. Hotel staff don't inform those customers to smoke in smoking zones. Hotel staff are least bothered and don't care for customers. There is another hotel next to this hotel with the name Arjunaa which is newly constructed and very nice hotel. I've attached few photos for your reference. I strongly recommend people visiting Rameswaram not to take hotel or have food in SS grand, but definitely take room and have food in Arjunaa.",1

When I called the customer care number and informed them about the issue and said I have a flight at 1.00 pm and cannot take a cab of 11.30am. They said because u have booked at 9.30 am, that's why the booking I done at 11.30. Also said if you want to cancel there would not be any refund. It's not my fault, I have done the booking for the correct time at 10.15 am and it's not possible to take a cab at 11.30 am for 1.00pm flight.

I paid quite a lot of additional amount just because it said Singapore airline as we wanted a comfortable flight.  But the flight in which we traveled was silk airline. I would have differently  booked a cheaper ticket if I have known. the information in their site was so misleading and when asked they blamed me saying of course the ticket will have Singapore airline flight number but u will travel in silk airway flight which have different nos. They were not at all helpful and not even ready to consider or acknowledge what happened.,1

Read this before Booking hotel through MakeMyTrip I had booked a hotel Through MMT on 16 jan for stay at Delhi from 19th-31st Jan. I had paid a full payment(8700/- including MMT Rs.800 service charges and taxes) in advance, and got booking confirmation through mail and Whatsapp. After reaching hotel at 12Pm on 19th they told me they don’t have not received my booking and dint allocate me any room & asked me to contact MMT customer care. After listening to this I was shocked. I contacted customer care the registered my complaint and told they’ll call me back. I got a call back from their representative, he told me booking was not confirmed due to some technical reason and he offered me refund, he had no solution as where should I stay now & where will I find a hotel to stay. I asked them to rebook my stay at same place, for which they said the same place is expensive now and cannot book now, I said I want an resolution and a room to stay I don’t want refund.

873,"Recently we made a booking for family vacation at Ramada Jaipur for Jan 11 to 13th. We selected 2 deluxe double rooms with breakfast as per the listed rate. Then we happily started preparing for the trip and were waiting for the vacation days. However, on the day 11th when we reached hotel for check-in the hotel staff informed us that the rooms do not include the breakfast. We talked to the MMT people they did not respond in positive manner and hung our phone stating they can't help it now. We again called them showed them all screen shots and billing details. After wasting more than half a day of our trip on calls with MMT representatives, we get to know that due to some technical issues the final bill payment statment did not include the correct option. Due to this technical error at their end, even if we paid equal to that of room + breakfast, they were not considering it. They said to charge us for the breakfast. They totally spoiled the feel and atomsphere of our family vacation. Better was not to rely on MMT. Having faith on them, made us to pay more. Bad experience. No help. Would say dont prefer MMT if you want peaceful n funfilled vacations. Henceforth will refrain from using makemytrip and would also not recommend to anyone. Don't use makemytrip. Regards, Charu",1

My name is Keshav Chopra. So it started like 10 days back I booked a cab for my parents from MUMBAI AIRPORT TO SILVASSA for 1:15 PM on 16 december 2019. Today when my parents reached at airport at 1:15PM I got to know that they didn't get any call either from MMT or the cab driver. I was stuck in a meeting due to which I was not able to respond to there calls but once at 1:30 I got to know about this concern that my parents are standing outside from last 30 minutes and they don't even know now what they have to do. Unfortunately your company did not informed me that they have cancelled my booking. When I contacted MMT executive he said we are unable to serve you better you book another cab as vendor not picking call. You tell me my parents are standing there and at last moment your executive just said this much that book another we will see what to do with refund. Now you guys tell me what is the responsibility of MMT? I am booking the cab with the brand just to ensure the best service not the kind of service your organization is providing. Then I am getting the calls from one of your team manager Mr. Hitesh pradhan or similar name better if you find the information from your end who was he. He is saying similar lines we apologize this that and we will find an alternative, but the point is I am getting that call at 2 PM. I WANT TO KNOW WHY? Why would I will make my parents stand outside for another one hour to beg in front of you. I am paying for the service and I have already paid for the cab booking as well. Is it customer duty to check with you guys that where is my driver? Why is your employees taking salary? I NEED A STRICT ACTION AGAINST THIS IN NEXT 24 HOURS OTHERWISE I WILL TAKE A LEGAL ACTION ON THIS FOR HARASSING SENIOR CITIZEN, WASTING MY TIME, NEGLIGENCE FROM YOUR EMPLOYEES. Anyhow I need a revert on this escalation and I want a action as well. Who so ever was handling my booking I need the action on him or her as well along with the best strict action on Team manager because he don't know how to manage the team at all. I am working in service sector and we know that customer pays for the services not for the product if you guys can't make this much better to shut your business. ITS BEEN MORE THAN 16 DAYS AND THEY SAID TO SOLVE THE CASE IN 96 HOURS. USELESS PEOPLE. MR. PRADHAN AND MR. GUJRAL WRITING THIS SPECIALLY FOR BOTH OF YOU.

877,"Initially, I thought of giving  a positive feedback. But the pathetic experience made me pen down this miserable night stay with my family. Our recent stay at Hotel Radoli House-Heritage Hotel, Jaipur recommended by Make My Trip was really disappointing and pathetic.  Apparently, the hotel looked average in terms of traditional Rajasthani architecture and decor. Also, the 3.3 rating for the hotel which was the only reason I went forward to book it for a night stay with my family. The worst journey started when we interacted with the hotel’s front desk guy(who did not even appeared to be a front desk executive) did not even consider to our requests for our basic amenities. Despite asking him several times for an extra blanket, he did not even bother to provide it. Although he acknowledged our request but he didn’t turn up even after repeated requests. The basic toiletries were also missing. When asked for the same, again there was no response. The worst part is that they served us Bisleri water bottles with broken seals as if they have been filled with the tap water. The breakfast was not even edible(tasted as if they have taken out from cold storage). I am wondering how can MMT recommend such a hotel to their customer which do not serve basic service the customer has paid for. I would strongly urge you to cross check with your concerned team before recommending such hotel to customer. Thanks for being spoiler to my vacation. I hope MMT will take necessary action regarding this. Please don’t consider to book this hotel.",1

I had to complain to hotel to change the room.  Hotel is far away and 1.5 hours of journey to site seeing morning and 1.5 hours journey in evening. Food quality provided was not up to the mark. inspite of paying so much money for my trip and planned so detail make my trip spoiled my whole trip and had issues at everywhere.  If you cannot provide proper service then why charge so much money. either you are running the company only for profits or you are least bothered about customers.  make my trip people dont respond on saturday and sundays. After all this issues you are providing me 3% of the money paid to you as a compliment for providing the bad service.  Finally you accept that you provided a bad quality service.",1
880,"TICKET PNR: 0058758995 Booking Id: NH7317536576768 MMT had booked the hotel through a supplier in Thailand and whose number was there on the voucher(Mvc patong house, phuket). I also mailed Thailand thinking that they can help me in confirmation of the booking. But they also said that MMT will have to do the necessary changes. In spite of making numerous calls to MMT, the problem could not be resolved.I have recorded all call of the customer service. As there was not much time left to change the booking, I mailed the hotel directly but they could not make the changes as the booking was done by a travel agent(Make My Trip). I kept calling Make My Trip from 27th December 2019 but every time they had the same thing to say. That they have written to the concerned department and it is on priority and the issue will be resolved soon. That someone will call me in 4-6 hrs. By that time, it was past midnight. When I asked to talk to a senior, I was told that they cannot do so as I did not have an extension number. I also wrote to hotelservice@makemytrip.com numerous times, but have just received a standard reply. If the booking was not changed in next 12 hrs, then this booking would be null and void as it will be of no use to me. I would have to make a new booking at the hotel and make full payment again. MMT did not reschedule the booking and hence I request Make My Trip to take a look into this matter and resolve it at the earliest so that I can get my refund. They have forced me to post my grievance on this Travel Forum as I am not getting any kind of help from their customer service. Iwill raise this issue with travel tourism.@makemytrip",3

882,"On 5th day of our tour on 27th December 2019  when we reached Jodhpur around 8:30, leaving Jaisalmer at 3:30 in the midnight, we found that the room booking by MMT was not available. They haven't booked a room for us even after booking trip one month earlier. They informed us to go to some Govind gruh resort but room was not booked, then told us to go to karunya royal n embracing thing is room was not booked there also. We are waiting here from 2 hours no customer executive resolved this issue. Worst experience. Sitting in hotel lobby for two hours even after paying 75k. Worst  experience. We will never opt Make my trip.",1
883,Time has come to teach lesson to makemy trip(MMT) people. They are arrogant and telling me to do whatever you want. They have cheated me Rs. 52K and not ready to refund.

884,"Reference No. 10133143232456128: NL2212462102912 Worst hotel booked by MMT for us at Hanoi We passed through an unforgettable and  worst experience of a hotel booked for us during our multi country visit in Nov. last week., at Hanoi in Vietnam. During our stay there, when we communicated our diificulties to some Utkarsh Singh, soon, and he promised us to solve the issue and revert back soon. Neither their local suppier  not any one from MMT reverted back or  replied  or solved the  issues as if not solvable in other country.MMT was not bothered once money is collected beforehand. The Hotel Atrium, Hanoi was pathetic, inconvenient, dirty and like a third class gas chamber. I was with family, for my pleasure trip, The question was of choice of hotel/ or our accommodation, which was highly incorrect, amidst tall claims, where ANYONE can be upset. 1.The 10X10  room was having leaking of water from one wall which soaked our bag full of fresh clothes in one night. The water was collected on floor, which was needing moping twice by worker, when reported at the front desk. The source of water may be likely from air conditioner drain pipe, which was opening in room! 2.There was NO  window, ventilator, gallery, balcony or exit/entry except only one door. I had shared the room pictures to MMT, soon. It was like a gas chamber(covered by spotted  wall papers), with stale air of days, offering smoky bad odour of perspiration and / or previous stay of an unhygeinic dirty passenger.The room was not cleaned too. The Hotel atrium was a small unit in highly congested area amidst small shops, and hotel people were running, a spa, beauty parlour for ladies, massage centre on ground floor. They had a couple of other rooms and this was the smallest cell like an Andaman cellular jail, which was allotted to us by MMT, . Verbal reassurances of MMT are never the prevalent facts on ground zero. Despite a clear cut MENTION in their  final voucher, this room especially had no breakfast facility, the front desk said. The other rooms had. While we had to leave the room early for morning itineraries, we managed the breakfast from outside. Though MMT charged us for the same and, it was written  written contract / voucher also., they can refer final voucher). Was that just for a writing? That indirectly suggests that criteria in selection of room by their  sales people/ you must have made wrongly/ without knowing details of hotel! There was no tea/ coffee in this room. The unit was not even the worth for motel. This was the statement given by the tour guide who used to pick up us, in mornings. Why to expect/ talk of swimming pool facility, even the napkin was not there in bathroom/ wash room. The owner behaved like as if she was obliging the street walkers for a free rain baseira. Atrium Hotel is situated in a narrow lane/ street., as shown in picture . MMT showed a class and level of maturity of choosing accommodations abroad for a client who trusted MMT . It was an absolutely uncomfortable stay for us in whole trip of 14 days. I have travelled so far 37 countries, but this is the first experience of getting cheated and being befooled, which shattered our trip pleasure. It was a pure betrayal by MMT, while we had laid a full trust on them. Who can remain silent on such issue. They should return our total stay charges of Hanoi, fully back to us. Dr.Vinod Parmar. And Major P.V.Parmar",1
885,Makemytrip promotes cheater insurance reliance. The Reliance are the biggest thief in the market. They just sell the insurance and do not entertain for claims.

My inferences for other guests are as follows. 1.Both Make my trip and Oyo's room are cheat company. 2.They don't have inter communication. 3.Once you pay they don't bother for guests and don't refund even if they do not arrange rooms. 4.The customer support of Make my trip is the worst.

When I checked with that driver, he simply refused to show up Finally after spooling my 2 hours (and entire trip), MakeMyTrip came up with a solution which was a compensatory amount of 25% of the booking amount.

I was assured that the request has been cancelled and tge refund would be processed. I did not get a notification again. I called again and they said they don't send cancellation notification. Aslo every time I asked what amount would be refunded they never gave the exact amount. After 10 more days later I got a message that an amount which was less than half the booking amount has been refunded. When I got back to them they said please check your bank account.

917,"Guys.pls think 100 times before booking on MMT. It is always better to book flight tickets on the airline website than having a middle man in between. The fares look cheap on the search page, but during check out, they will add convenience charge of Rs 1350, which is non- refundable. The bank offers they run are nothing but cheating and another way of extracting money. Even in the case of part cancellation or rescheduling, they deduct the entire amount. Most important - In case of cancellation within 24 hrs they will take the regular cancellation charge+ MMT charge. Whereas if you cancel on Indigo website, they give 100% refund. Here is my case - Unfortunately I had to do part cancellation of my ticket. I called Indigo and asked them to cancel. Many days after the cancellation was done, refund had not come. I called MMT asking why the tickets are still showing active on their website and refund has still not come. The answer I got was that they have not received any such request. Whereas, I had got a confirmation e-mail from Indigo on the same day. I had received 10% instant discount as bank offer. They deducted the complete amount even for the active ticket. So it ultimately worked out to be more expensive than buying on Airline website and upon that an added hassle of following up with MMT.",1

The hotel had a rule that all occupants must attend the New year party on 31st December The cost was INR 2000 per person. We were not interested in that party, neither the food nor anything.  No way we spend that much money for a New year party. But we were made to pay irrespective we attend the party or not . This cost me additional 8000 INR.  There were other guests as well who did not want to attend the party. However the hotel management was extremely adamant. This was a sore point of the vacation. MakeMytrip through whom the hotel booking was done did not help at all . Their point was that I had agreed for such a cost during the booking - which I checked later was there in one of the finest of fine prints somewhere at the bottom of the page where we are made to pay the money .

931,I was suppose to travel with my family.  But this turned in nightmare as I landed in airport. I was expected to get SMS from MMT but SMS never came and log in to see driver details online.  I tried calling driver 10 times. he didnt respond. finally I tried calling customer support MMT. To reach MMT itself it took me 15-30 min over phone.  I explained my situation to MMT support team. MMT support team cooly says sir you can cancel and MMT will refund the money with no options to  me given and left alone me to handle my further travel soley on me.   I was so angry you expect from MMT some responsibility its not that I just booked 30 min back. The booking was confirmed 4 days back.   MMT cooly says we are unable to find cab. why are you running the business. please do favour dont do cabs business if u cant and spoil people trips heaven sake.   I wish could give you negative not zero rating. Dear Families please avoid MMT you cant rely on them.,1

Just a few days before our start from Kolkata I received a call from them that cab from lalkuan station to binsar had been cancelled. We had no alternative but to start our journey and hired a car from Lalkuan station to Binsar Himalayan canvas hotel at a higher price. After reaching the hotel we were advised by the hotel authority that our booking has been cancelled though we provided receipt for full payment to the hotel we were not allowed to stay . After contacting the MMT they simply told me that your refund has been made. You just imagine how we have been harrassed faced difficult situation after a long journey from Kolkata to Lalkuan and then to Binsar. To reach the hotel reception we had to climb at least 70 stairs with heavy rains by old aged persons like us suffering from ailments like heart problems and osteoarthritis. We were compelled to arrange our own arrangement in a nearby hotel at a higher price. Again on 30Sept we did not receive any message from the MMT regarding driver details for our next journey to Pithoragarh . So we tried to contact them several times from 3hrs before journey and after a long time we were advised that the driver cancelled the cab though a few minutes before they had told me that the cab would reach on scheduled time. So what to do at that remote place which is far away from the market place? With our sincere requests to the manager we could arrange for a car at a very high rate . We therefore request everybody not to book any hotel/cab/flight through this company.",1

He has confirmed the booking for my guest from 14 - 16 Oct 2019 for 11 rooms. He has also shared the confirmation number and voucher with us. The booking was re-confirmed in the morning of 14th Oct 2019 with Mr. Nimit Sehgal. Inspite of all the checks my guest was denied check in saying that they do not have the rooms available. My guest were transferred to other nearby hotel(Ambica Palace). I have again checked with Mr. Nimit in the evening that this should not happen again and rest of the guest should have the check in smoothly. To my surprise, I got a call from my client in the late night(11PM) that my guest( 1 male member and 2 female member) denied check in again saying that the rooms are not avaibile. This was very distressful for my guest who were travelling from very far off places. Actually they had no rooms available. Everyone from the client side/ guest were calling me for the disaster that has been created by Mr. Nimit Sehgal. I had to explore the hotel and instantly book another room at Ambica Palace. She was sent there and by the time she check in it was around 1AM. This person has created disaster for my guest and my reputation with the client. I am still unable to comprehend the situation that I have lost face to my client without my mistake. This has led us sleepless night/ continuous stress and what not.

949,"Hi Guys! How do you feel if you come to know that the hotel you booked does not exist? Won’t it be more embarrassing if you find a Hotel in the location shared by the booking app? Yes, it is possible if you book through Make My Trip. I drove all the night from Chennai to Bangalore and then to Mysore, with my wife, and my 3 yo and 9 yo kids, accompanied by one of my cousins, tired to the core, just to realize that the Hotel, in which Make My Trip gave me a confirmed booking for two rooms, was sold out two years ago! And, a new management had taken over the premises to run a Hotel in another name. It was more interesting to see three more customers reached the same hotel with the same issue. And the receptionist told me that this is a daily affair. As usual I reached out them just to hear that give me 15 minutes for 4 times and the fifteen minutes never came and I had to call them back. I feel pity on the executives, who had to face the flak when the real culprits, the legal or the admin, whoever, were hiding in the background. They do not have the basic sense to at least check if there is a hotel exist before giving a booking confirmation. Finally they were ready to cancel the booking and refund the money, which was far too less when compared to the discounted, advancing booking amount. That too there was only one room available for all these members in the Hotel.",1
950,"Recently we travelled from Delhi to Greece. Initially we were informed that for Shengan Visa we had to go to Mumbai or Delhi. It was we who informed the MMT team that there are visa services in Hyderabad for Shengan Visa. In Hyderabad, the Visa Services check all Visa requirement papers before they accept but we were asked to courier all the papers to Chennai first. They took a week to return. This was worrisome. Tentative flt. bookings were given to us which we were not aware of. We had circulated those flt timings to our family. When the actual flt. itinerary was given there was no time to convey it to them. That got them worried as tracking us was not possible. 2 days before travel we were advised by MMT team to carry at least 600- 700 Euros. Euros don't come out of Indian ATMs. MMT should apprise customers well in advance. We were also told that we should carry all the papers that we had presented for our visa which is ridiculous. We have travelled enough number of times abroad to know that once Visa is granted you do not need those papers. We met other Indians in Athens who had also travelled through MMT and they had better hotels. The discrimination is in-explainable. MMT's service partner Cell Tours in Athens were bad. We did not get enough information from them. We were asked to go to pick-up points which we had no clue about. Why do we then go through MMT? The city tour was just a ride in the bus without any stop anywhere to see anything and without any explanation whatsoever. MMT should be able to customise trips depending on the age and taste of their customers. Also leaving tourists to their devises without anything planned for them does not work. MMT should send their team(people of all ages) to find out about the places before they sell them to to their customers. Finally, on our way back from Istanbul to Delhi, without a bye or leave, we were transferred to Indigo Airlines where we had the worst experience. The food served was horrendous. Although they may say that it is not their fault, we hold MMT responsible for the flt because we had paid for Turkish Airlines. In fact MMT should reimburse the money for that leg. In short we were disappointed with the services of MMT and will neither avail nor recommend it to anyone in future.",1

957,"Recently, on September 19, 2019, I made a booking at Lemon Tree Hotel, New Delhi for spending my day using the latest “Make My Day” scheme by MMT.  The Make My Day offer included a room from 11 AM till 5 PM, buffet lunch, access to the pool and gym. Since the offer seem to be lucrative, I made the bookings and paid directly to MMT using the app. Accordingly, I received a payment confirmation slip. I reached the hotel at about 1 PM. On my arrival at the hotel reception (a) they were not aware of any bookings done through MMT, (b) the contact details in the confirmation slip were of the deputy manager of Lemon Tree Hotel who had no idea about what was I saying; (c) I was told to pay before I could use the room. Finally after 40 minutes of harassment at the reception, the executive told me that “we just checked at our end with MMT EVERYTHING IS IN ORDER and you may please use the room”. Finally at 1:45 PM I entered the room and then went for  buffet lunch which was included in my package. at the lunch I wasn’t convinced with the chicken they served and accordingly I informed the Chef, who immediately relates a fresh dish for me and served it. However, at the time of leaving, I was charged ₹500 for the same. The rooms were really small no nothing was so exciting about it. So finally I checked out at sharp 5:00 PM. Now the real drama started, I was shocked when at the reception I was told to pay for using the room and buffet lunch. I repeated the entire conversation that I had at the time of check-in but the hotel management was adamant that I cannot leave without paying. This is when I called the helpline no. of MMT and after waiting for several minutes, my call being transferred to at least 4 different executives, repeating the entire sequence of events at least 4 times, I was told they will do something about it. Meantime at the hotel, after wasting another 45 minutes they told me you can leave now we will coordinate with MMT. ALL THIS TRULY MADE MY DAY",1

980,"I've booked many flights through third parties before without any issues. Sometimes they charge a bit of a fee, which is fine. For this one I paid extra for seat selection, which I later learned on the airline's website would have been free. That's fine. I didn't notice that the passenger information didn't have a middle name field and it was supposed to be entered after the first name in the same box. I thought there would be a screen later where I put accurate information along with my passport information, but that didn't happen. I called them within minutes, and was connected with a rude and confrontational call center agent. I explained what happened, and he quoted me a$75 cancellation fee, or a$148 name change fee. I've cancelled or updated my name on flights through third party websites within 24 hours with no fee before. I took the information and called the airline directly. As it was a business day I couldn't call Mytrip back for a couple hours. When I called back I was told the cancellation fee was now$148, but the airline wouldn't allow them to cancel, which contradicts everything I've known. I requested to speak to a manger and was told there wasn't one there, and I couldn't speak to one. That I should call back some other day. After 15 minutes of insisting I was put through to a manager(probably just another agent) who was rude and explained any changes have to be made through them within 2 hours. I bit the bullet, and put in the name change request. I had previously called the airline directly to provide my passport information, and to confirm that the name change request had to go through the booking agent. The next day I get an e-mail from mytrip that I need to call the airline and have them send mytrip a letter of authorization to add my middle name. I called and spoke with the airline on two occasions, and they confirmed the request has to come from the booking agent. I called mytrip back and explained and I was just read the same statement from a script over and over. They did not listen to the situation. So now I'm stuck in a circle with a few plane tickets that I most likely can't use since Canada has strict rules about having your ticket name match the passport name. I've spent 6+ hours trying to resolve this the last 2 days, and will probably have to just purchase tickets again. At this point I've contacted regulatory bodies and consumer watchdog organizations. This company will not help you. They don't even pretend to try.

I had to cancel the hotel booking at GLM Meridian, Chennai as when I reached there at 9:30 PM, rooms were not available and when I called make my trip customercare they told me that they cant check my booking details now as make my trip IT services are down for at least one and half hours and I should wait and call after one and hour hour to get my issue resolved. Now I can't write reviews for that hotel as I cancelled my booking(hotel people as well as customercare executive told me to cancel the booking). This made me to take a decision of switching over to other travel apps and delete my profile from make my trip. Now when your experience is good, they will bombard you with mails/sms/notifications to write reviews and share your experience but when customer experience is bad there is no way to write reviews or one should experience the bad services offered to be able to write reviews.",1

So I called them and they commit that they will get the booking confirm but they are not able to do it hence it cancelled. They promise that they will refund the money but after several times of doing follow up via call and email, I didn't get the money back.They are such a cheater. This is to warn everyone, don't do booking with them .",1
983,"We have booked hotel - Nimrana The Old Heritage at Cochin through MMT during Diwali holidays but when we checked in we were informed at the Hotel that their rooms are already sold out and MMT has not given them any specifications and they offered us one dark damp room in the ground floor which we had refused. Thereafter MMT representatives forced us to settle for and take that room which we refused again and booked The Gateway Hotel Marine Drive at Ernakulam on our own and enjoyed our stay. We repeatedly communicated with MMT to refund the money and My Reference ID for the same is 181109-089530. MMT people give repeated phone calls and when you come to the point they disconnect the call and say that their call dropped. But till date MMT, being so unscrupulous and fraud, have not refunded the money. They do unfair means in business and they cheat their clients. I used to be a regular customer of MMT but now I hardly take their service. Thanks and regards, Debasish Roy Chowdhury",1

985,"I had booked return flights to Kashmir for a trek and was really disappointed with the situation there due to article 370. However, I was a little relieved when I got a message from MMT that I can cancel my booking without any waiver fees(screenshot attached). But I got about 3.7K less. When asked they said I did not get the full refund of return airlnes, as it is on 19th Aug and the refund message deadline date was 9th Aug(nowhere in the message there is mention of any dates). It is common sense, that if I am cancelling my onward booking, why will I retain the return journey booking?! especially when both were booked under same booking id. Beside the curfew in Srinagar is still on. The message sent to all customers doesn't really matter, as the refund amount will be as per their conditions and unexplained unless asked for one.  It is really disappointing.",1

991,"I took a sleeper bus package from Banglore to Tirupati Balaji. My bus timing was 9pm and due to some reason bus got late and the pickup bus took us to their office where we were told to wait on the roadside instead of providing us some space in their office. We waited there till 12 for the bus. In the morning when we reached Tirupati we collected our tickets for darshan which I had never done before as in the package we get VIP tickets and there is no need for us to stand in que for tickets. In the package we selected with MMT it was written that they would provide us free tickets but when we called them that we need to have VIP darshan tickets they told us that you pay Rs.300 to our guide when you reach Tirupati and he will manage. We got timing for darshan at 6pm. Then we were taken to the hotel 7 Hills to freshen up and breakfast. The room was so cheap and dirty that we couldnt even use the toilets. We hardly had a bath over there. When we came down for breakfast which was so unhealthy and dirty that I couldnt even taste that. Some of the people had it and they were told that only 2idli and 1 vada will be provided to you with tea/coffee. One of my friend demanded for extra vada which they denied which is so unhuman. They further took us to the temple where the guide of our bus i.e. Greenline Travels told us to move into the line of 1pm for darshan as we will leave at 3pm from here anyhow. If you dont come back it will be your fault. We asked him that our timing is 6pm for darshan on which he told us that you dont have to show your ticket to any guard, just tell them that your ticket is with others who have entered the temple and you have been left behind and they dont even have the mobile phones that we could contact them. We entered inside and the guard denied us to move as we didnt have tickets. Then he allowed one of us to move in and search for your friends and come back with the tickets of others. Now the problem was that there was no friend inside who took our tickets with him, we were just lying as we were told to say. Then we entered there like a thief when no one was looking at us that was such a guilt feeling. In the evening we came back at about 5 from the temple. Then the guide took us back to that weird hotel where again each person was given only 2chapatis. After that he told us that the sleeper bus will go at 11pm if you want to go earlier you can go with our normal bus which was a cheap act done by him as we were told that we will reach banglore in between 10-11pm. We said that you either refund our money if we will go with normal bus which he denied. Then we called their head office who told us that you will have to wait till 11pm for sleeper bus. The guide took us to their office where there were hardly 4-5 seats for us to sit. We waited for the bus till 11pm on the road and no food was provided to us further. The reason which we came to know about the delay was the bus was not fully occupied so in order to fillup the empty seats they delayed our bus by 5-6hours which is not good on their part. My experience was very bad with makemytrip and Greenline Travels. I would say that nobody should travel with them. This is the worst service I have ever seen.",1

996,Worst ever experience. NEVER BOOK HOLIDAYS WITH MMT. Their sales team will commit anything you ask for - before you make the advance payment. Once that is done the confirmation team comes with their own set of rules. Later when you  try to reach them for confirmation of the hotels and flight you have to go through the call center - who make you hold for hours before you reach their customer care executive and explain your case again and again every time. Hotel confirmation happens one day before the stay - through out the tour. - mostly degraded. Their mode of operation is they book for whatever price you negotiate for and then take their cut and pass you on to the mercy of some local travel co who are least bothered of their reputation as they have no real presence. Overall nightmare.,1

In nutshell it is better to book tickets directly it ll be cheaper .MMT team along with the all boys and girls are worthless .So pls avoid this agent otherwise you ll agin get cheated,1

1001,"Hi, I spoke with a tour consultant, Harsh Prajwati for a luxury holiday booking to Delhi and Agra [3N/4D] on June 29th. I told him I can travel anytime in July except I need to be at home on Sunday. He came up with July 17th-20th as the dates of travel and send me a link with the itinerary. He suggested we visit Delhi on 17th and 18th and visit Agra on 19th, Friday. The link also had an option to make a partial payment for the holiday. After looking at the itinerary everything looked fine and immediately I made the partial payment for the package. After 10 mins, I got a call from MMT sales consultant, Harsh who sold me the package stating that Tajmahal is closed on Friday. He will change the itinerary to visit Agra on our first day(Wednesday) and 2nd and 3rd night we will stay in Delhi. He told me he will take care of the change and send me the details soon. I waited for 2 days, I didn't hear back from him. So I called the helpline and opened a complaint. He told me everything will be taken care and I don't have to worry. Meanwhile, I got a message in my WhatsApp from a lady called Divya Mathur that she is my relation officer and any issues she will help me. I told her about the itinerary mess up and she asked me not to worry and she will take care. After 2 more days, I got an email with the new itinerary that I will visit Agra first and then Delhi. I was happy that everything was taken care. I made the last payment for the holiday. On July 9th I received the holiday booking card from Divya Mathur that had the flight tickets, hotel vouchers. In that, I found out that they didn't make any changes to my booking and We will visit Agra on a day when it will be closed. I immediately messaged Divya Mathur. She replied it will be taken care and her team is working on it. I kept checking with her everyday and she replied it will be taken care. On July 13th I found the other contact in my booking for relations officer. So I wrote an e-mail to that mail id stating the problem and about the poor response from sales consultant Harsh Prajapati and Divya Mattur-relation officer. I also requested a manager to call me and explain what's happening I also called their helpline and opened one more complaint. After that, I got an email from Mr.Sagar that he is working on my problem and the salesperson Harsh will call me and brief me. On 15th July around 4 o'clock, I got a call from Harsh that they couldn't get the confirmation of the hotel. We still have to go to Agra on Friday when it will be closed. We have to wake up early on Sat and Visit Tajmahal and then return to Delhi to catch our flight. I don't understand how MMT is a customer-centric company whereas none of the folks who work there even care about the customers. They are very keen on getting the payment and they don't hesitate to make false promises. Also, they have lazy, irresponsible people who work for the company.",1

They have left it on driver court so that he can demand as many as they can driver was ready for AC if I piad him 5 rs more/km but MMT said no we cant tell them to switch ON AC in hilly areas Request to everyone never ever book cabs from MMT specially On hilly areas. they left you on mercy of drivers they will ruin your journey. the point is not the extra money which you have to pay for AC.

Force food habits on customers, let you deal with hotel and driver tantrums and problems while their local tour manager does nothing.

Why can't they resolve the issue over email ? When I would call back then their elite helpdesk employees won't entertain the call coz the customer is the one who has to be available at your disposal 3) the driver did not have an actual license coz of which we almost got denied access to where we needed to go. 4) driver didn't know any route and we survived by using Google maps. In fact when wisdom would strike his otherwise useless brain he would just end up messing up the directions further 5) he didn't know how to drive on the hills too well. There were people getting pissed off at him on the road 6) to change cab bookings one can't extend a day with makemytrip and you instead get charged basis a new trip which turns out much cheaper.

I really fedup and frustrated about your services, I booked two tickets for me and my wife and money deducted from my paytm account and still, seats are not booked, I don't wait till 9th july(12 long days to refund as per so called poor policy)to refund, I want my money back within 12 hours, I feel looted from you. I want a reasonable answer for this query  If money gets deducted how it possible to not get a ticket from the same bus operator?",1
1027,"I had booked my flight ticket on 23/01/19 through Make MyTrip for 26/05/19 from Chandigarh to Mumbai the amount being 13, 934 and the airline was Jet Airways. Everybody knows the airline closed and I had to bear the loss. Not only I had to pay 8000 extra amount 22, 914 even after cancellation and me chasing Make My Trip for refund the past few months I have still not got my money back whereas I have heard others have. What I donot understand is if MMT earns pretty well from these airlines then why is it not paying its clients and chase the airlines for the refund. Why is it causing great inconvenience for its clients who have been with them like me for the past so many years whereas we are the ones who generate business for them. We really need to reconsider these service providers who in the guise of benefactors are like wolves who fleece you",1
1028,"I had booked a flight forst Aprilin the month of Januarythrough MakeMyTrip. Unfortunately, the tickets were cancelled by Jet Airways and I was supposed to receive a refund for the cancelled flight.

We will process the refund as soon as we receive it from the airline."" It's been more thanmonths and I'm still waiting for my refund.

1030,"I was very happy with the company with my first international trip in 2017 but when I booked my 2nd international trip, they ruined my whole trip and charged double in comparing with other trip providers. They shown me the fake images of the hotel and gave the worst hotel room, they gave me the itinerary which was totally different when I reach the destination. Even they didn't send the flight tickets till the last 30 mins of my departure. They didn't revert me on call after receiving total package cost which was actually the double cost. They gave me the worst experience this time and when I ask for the update of the hotel and refund the money no one was there to respond. I will never ever recommend anyone to go with Make My Trip for any of your international trip.",1

So I went back to the Make my trip airport office and I booked the package it cost me 35k for two persons including Cab and Hotels for 3 Days two nights. Really it was a pleasant trip for me they provide us 3 star hotels accommodation and guides as well. Only one thing is, actually it wont cost if we book direct, I know that make my trip charged me more, but for me at that time no other choice.",1

Very slow processing and waste of time.So please don't use it.",1

Everytime a new person just keeps calling to know if the issue is solved then from the scratch keep explaining them what is the issue and same story again....it's a pain ! I regret saving some penny! And go through this and that too still not received the cashback! They have weird answers saying , the cashback will only come after u enjoy the trip and come! Some say it's not in our hand bank will give. They don't have idea about the hotel, they will get back to their senior then get back...and then I have explain the whole story again, in that much time u will get better response from the hotel directly only!!

1040,"I needed to change the travel date of my return flight after I arrived in Auckland from Bangalore. I called their number and was told by the operator that no one could help me until after four hours. It was late at night so I went to sleep. When I woke up I found an email from MakeMyTrip saying the return flight was cancelled according to my request(I did not request it) and no refund would be given. I immediately called their number and had to wait 45 minutes just to get trhough. I was assured it was a mistake by the operator and everything would be fixed, but just be patient. I waited a further four hours with no response so I called again. After being cut off several times I finally connected to an operator who again assured me the flight would be reinstated and not to worry. A further day passed with no response. I called again and again and kept getting the same answer. Finally, I got an email form MakeMyTrip saying the case was closed. I took my complaint to Visa who refunded me the entire ticket amount. Then MakeMyTrip protested the refund pretending that I had cancelled the return trip with no follow-up calls. At this stage, Visa has not debited my account and I don't expect they will. But the whole experience has been horrible. I will NEVER use this company again and warn everyone that the customer service is non-existent. They have shown themselves to be completely shady operators not interested in genuine customer service at all. You are much better going direct to the Airline or CheapOair has much better customer service.(the only problem with CheapOair is if you want o pay for seats later, they charge in Us dollars which is quite expensive.",5

1046,"Hi Guys, It's my personal advice don't rely on International flight bookings with makemytrip which I faced horrible experience when I booked a ticket for my elderly parents and my kid who is 5 years old. We booked a flight from Bengaluru to Heathrow - London and we paid for seat selection and other things. When we tried to do web check-in whatever the things we added additional is not there and the worst thing is we got the very last seats keeping the kid and didn't opt the meal preference. When we contact MakeMyTrip customer care they talked in a way something happens and if you want to get a refund will do. But in the makemytrip ticket booking, I can see the seats selected by me. No more flight bookings with makemytrip. MakeMyTrip - It doesn't matter about money it's about people's value and don't lose it. And also try to understand customer situations and react based on that. Strictly no more International flight bookings with MakeMyTrip.Thank you Thanks, Karnan",1

I have booked car from Mumbai to lonavala one and half month before with full payment. 15 minutes before departure time cab cancelled with vague reason (driver had filled uppetrol in the diesel car.....????????).No alternate cab provided. What the f...... Bad service experience They provide compensation.

Never useservice of car booking on makemytrip.,3

1055,This is just to bring into your knowledge that I traveled to Manali with one of my female friend and there was a booking through Indo Canadian for 26th May(Sunday) 6:30pm. I booked Indo Canadian Mercedes bus and paid 1250 each for the booking but as per the bus coordinator  there was no confirmation of the ticket. Our seat number was 21 & 22 which was confirmed by MMT but I got the seat on the last row that too where all were boys and no other female. We didn't get any information that tickets were not confirmed. Conductor and bus coordinator was too harsh to discuss things. He clearly told us to go back on the seat which has been provided by him else we can get down from the bus incase we don't want to sit there. I just don't get this that why this has been handled like this. We paid for business class Mercedes bus and we got the basic/executive one. We got to know the actual charges of the per seat is approx 800 rs. for that bus.The entire staff was rude & unethical. Even they left 1 couple on the way and bus conductor wasn't ready to go back to pick them up and they were asking their contact number from other passengers. We spoke to Make my trip team as well and as per them the ticket was confirmed from their end I just need an action against conductor & specially a bus coordinator. Also we need refund for this. This unprofessional behavior wont be acceptable and shouldn't be repeated in future. 2 girls has to sit with other 4-5 guys and that too when their seat were confirmed. I WANT YOU GUYS TO GET BACK TO ME ON THIS ELSE I WILL USE MY MEDIA CONTACT AGAINST THE COMPANY. ALSO I WANT THIS ISSUE TO GO DIRECTLY TO THE FOUNDER OF THE COMPANY ELSE YOU GET READY FOR A BIG DISASTER.,1
1056,They have annoying and irresponsible customer service and not to mention their complicated IVR. They pretty much shed away all their responsibility to customers in the fine print of their website. All the services are outsourced and they don't care about customers. Money is the primary objective. Good luck for those who try to get anything done with makemytrip customer service.,1
1057,Hotel onwer was unsympathetic and unconcerned to the difficulties faced by senior citizens.despite repeated inquires he concealed the fact that rooms were at the basement level.on my arrival me and my parents were stranded on road for.more than 3 hrs because my father was unable to climb and reach the room.but he didn't make any suitable alternate arrangement and switched off his mobile . simultaneously he himself drives the car and do the business of seight seeing.only 1 servant is available in home stay through which he communicates.on last day he made arrangement at substandard hotel for which he paid 1000 RS .dis indicates his ATTITUDE .even ibibo didn't extend any help to us it seems system of online booking is and escapee route for such unscrupulous People .it is requested that his home stay may be delisted for some time so that such people don't take tourists for granted.,1

It gets ever better when you call their call center team they have been refunding my money since last 20 days it’s still not come.Their apparent call back time from their call center team to discuss problem is 24 hours. They use cheap vendors to provide cars and don’t care about customer service.they promise you 1000 rs compensation from their side and it expires in 2 week. Would rather recommend going to Dadar taking a Shivnath bus or a train or a friends car but never use this site to book.

About 6 days prior to the departure, we received an email that the flight was rescheduled with a layover of 18h in Rwanda!I called the airline and they offered an alternative that I was ok with and they requested that MMT send them an authorization email to confirm the change. This is where my nightmare ordeal with MMT began. Over the next 5 days, I called over a dozen times and had to repeat the request each time, was told that it would be done priority, was not allowed to talk to any supervisor to escalate my request, was told the airline office was unreachable and a lot of other excuses. I finally called the airline again on the morning of my travel and was told that they never received any request for my travel to MMT. I ended up spending 18h in Rwanda and I am extremely disillusioned with all the lies and dishonesty from MMT. They really need to critically evaluate their staff and fire all the incompetent and dishonest employees. Have used MMT for almost 10y now but will be open to alternatives going forward.",1

Most ever worst organaization and staff.all cheaters,1
1079,"This an honest feedback, Places were not covered as per the itinerary, always they have a reason of traffic jam / bad weather / security issue. In Srinagar we visited only, Dal lake and  Shankaracharya temple. They did not take us to Mughal Garden, Cheshma Shahi, Nishat Bagh, Shalimar Bhag which was part of our itinerary. We would have booked the room for the driver as well, as he was approaching us to share the room to perform his daily routines.(Incident took place in both in Patnitop and Vaishno devi temple). This is very irritating where we do not have our personal life. He requested room key and said will be sleeping in room, until we finish Vaishodevi darshan and return to room. He slept and utilized bath room as well. 3. Driver dropped us in Phalgam on 27/April/2019 and was not in contact till Monday 28/April/2019 evening. Did not guide us properly nor assisted us to visit the places. We had to take assistance of hotel management and visited the places, but did not cover Chandanwari which was part of our itinerary. We were stuck in traffic jam while travelling from Phalgam to Katra and reported the incident to MMT, requested assistance from Make My Trip. But no response from them. MMT contacted us after 14 hours of raising the request. Over all we had bad experience with MMT package. a. Cost is very high but did not provide proper facilities. b. Check in and Check out of the hotels were booked only half day in all hotels expect Phalgam. c. We have to book the room for the driver as well, else we have to share the rooms with them. d. Timings are not covered properly and they miss out the places to save money. e. Concern which they have before booking, does not remain post booking.",1

Booking id(NC261875611196071). Makemytrip has the worst and useless cab service I have ever experienced. I will never book on makemytrip again and will ask my friends and family not to use makemytrip. You have wasted my entire day. I have a booking on the 24th of April I am cancelling that as well.,1
1087,"We had booked a cab from Amritsar to Dalhousie on makemytrip.com. We did so thinking their service is reliable and safe for any outstation journey, but the reality was not so. The once the cab got changed and the one alloted to us refused to pick us from the said pickup point(entered on the website). We however agreed(paid extra to our ongoing cab to drop us at the point) and moved to the point where the driver asked us to come. It was expected that he should come at the stipulated location. The driver was rude and misbehaved with my wife, he tried to push her. We somehow got out the situation. Punjab was new to us and didn't want to take it forward to the police with this unruly driver and cab agency. But it was the worst experience and frightening one too. We did call makemytrip and they said they will take action and refund me the booking amount, but I think that was a false promise. Makemytrip does not care about customers and just wants to globble their money. I do not advice any body to book a cab for any purpose from makemytrip and would request you to be wary of their other services.",1

When I reached Bangalore, Jet Airways person said that Makemytrip did not update my contact details hence they could not get in touch with me. When I tried reaching Makemytrip help line it never got connected. More over their self help chat bot(Myra I guess) automatically closes the complaint making it request(pathetic). Complaint is never a request. Jet Airways actually said I have to spend night and take another flight the day after. They will not provide any accommodation, take flight to Mumbai and make my own arrangement from Mumbai to go to Pune or take refund and book some other airline which was costly as hell. I was with my wife and 4 yr old daughter and was in no mood to fight at the airport so took flight to Mumbai and came to Pune by spending almost Rs. 3000. Makemytrip never bothered to acknowledge their fault. This is third experience with Makemytrip. No more makemytrip.",1
1092,"I have used makemytrip.com many years for flight bookings and recently I had a very bitter experience. This is what happened: I had booked a round trip from Hyderabad to New Delhi(ref # NF29114189701278) for my relatives. However, after they boarded the flight to New Delhi - they announced that the Air India flight got cancelled due to some technical problem and they had to return. Air India has given personal confirmation that they will refund full amount. Then I have immediately called the Makemytrip support and asked them to refund full amount for the return trip which is a Spice Jet flight. They said that ""Spice Jet"" is a CONFIRMED flight and REGULAR cancellation charges will apply. However, I told them that it is ridiculous that if I can't start the trip, I can't end the trip-THIS IS BASIC COMMON SENSE. I TOLD THAT I BOOKED A ROUND TRIP, NOT A ONE-WAY. Then they told that as per their policy - NORMAL cancellation charges will apply. HERE ARE THE NORMAL CANCELLATION CHARGES: The cancellation charges are also very high. I have paid Rs. 4172/- per head; and they have applied cancellation charges of Rs. 3000/-+ Rs. 300/- per head. The refund amount for the return trip was almost 10-20% of the total payment. makemytrip or any other vendor must have FAIR CANCELLATION policies that DOES NOT ROB customers OF THEIR hard earned money. IN A ROUND TRIP, IF YOU CAN'T START, YOU CAN'T END. THAT'S IT. So, people must know who they are booking with before falling prey to THE SELF-MADE POLICIES for these organizations.

1098,"Hello, Please stop making false claims about 1 hour resolution to customers since you don't have either the intent or the ability to service your customers. I had booked a cab through your portal(Booking ID NC260103793640763) for a 2 day trip to Rishikesh. The Cab you sent was in very poor condition, Power Windows not working properly, Seats broken. I did not complain for the same however, since I thought this happens sometimes. However, the cab broke down on the return journey at 8 PM and I called your 24 X 7 helpline( Or Can'tHelpline to be honest) . They refused to send another cab to us and asked me to pay for the trip completed till then and manage the rest of the journey ourself. Unbelievable Right! After an hour with a temporary fix the Cab was moving again. I requested again to send another Cab since it was risky and we may get stuck on the way. But they didn't care. The cab broke down 3 times on the way. We had to reach at 11 pm - 11 30 pm. We were able to reach at 4 am in the morning. Whole trip got ruined. My advise to people - Don't book anything through Makemytrip since in thier own words ""we are just a medium between customer and vendor, and cant take responsibility for issues that occur during the journey"". Thanks MakemyTrip was completely ruining the experience for my whole team. Never booking anything with you people again. Thanks.",1

After I changed the coupon code, the flights after few secs showed me seating arrangements and as I kept on digging into discounts, they changed my flight to morning. Take Care, not to be bewitched by their Offers and Discounts as they are making you fall prey to their Travel Insurance demands.

1100,"On 21st Feb 2019 I had booked my trip from Mumbai to Bkk ( return) on Jet Airways through MakeMyTrip. A couple of days later we get an email from jet saying the flight from Mumbai to Bkk stands cancelled. I called up MakeMyTrip the same day but they had no proper information but said that they would issue a refund OR put me onto another jet flight. Since jet was cancelling alot of their flights it made more sense to take the refund instead of the flight transfer. The same night I called MakeMyTrip again to find out about the issue , they said the file was updated and that a rep would call me within 24 hrs and take me through the refund or transfer process. Exactly the next day at around 3 - 3:30pm I received a call from a MakeMyTrip employee ( AVINASH , code 9661) he gave me all my details including my name / flight details / flight timings and dates of arrival and departure. He confirmed that both my going and return flights were cancelled and that I was eligible for the full refund of RS 15, 990/- ( the amount I had paid) . For the refund process he said I have to download the MakeMyTrip app called any.desk which MakeMyTrip uses for the refunds, And that the amount will reflect in the account after I have verified my card details in the form. After doing the same I began to receive OTP for amounts of 1500/- , 8000/- and then again 8000/-. After the first OTP I realised that the person on the other end had connected to my phone and was mirroring my phone. He had seen the card details that I was filling in ( PLEASE NOTE : I HAD NOT VERBALLY GIVEN ANY DETAILS TO THIS PERSON). He had seen these details and had also seen the otp as he had remotely connected to my phone and was viewing everything I was doing. He saw the OTP for the 1500/- and the first 8000/- but I managed to disconnect before he could get the second 8000/-. I contacted MakeMyTrip regarding this and spoke to them about my Information being leaked and this person knowing full well that I was expecting a call and that he had all my information that MakeMyTrip had. I have spoken to 3 different people in two days - relaying the same incident. Everytime they say they will get back. Emails are never answered properly as their email ids are somehow incorrect. I finally resorted to contacting them on Facebook. I received replies and subsequent emails as they took down my details AGAIN. A certain Mr. BHUPINDER SINGH was following up with the issue BUT again after 3 days he has disappeared and I have NO CONCRETE FEEDBACK on how they are tackling the issue at hand. It has been close to 3 weeks and they do not seem to be bothered AT ALL. To top it off, they sent an email and message to consumers saying MakeMyTrip does not make fraud calls and ask people to download apps, all this AFTER I was hounding them for days on end! I HONESTLY FEEL THAT WHAT HAPPENED TO ME WAS AN INSIDE JOB ON THE PART OF MAKEMYTRIP. AND I WOULD NEVER USE IT AGAIN.",1

1106,"Hello Team, This is to bring to your notice that I am totally unhappy with the cab service provided by MMT. You guys are partnering with goons to just compete with your competitors. I had booked a cab with booking ID NC250412210670499 which had 4 days of trip with total 1200 kms in it. Daily the driver used to drop us to designated place and drive the car for his convenience to have his breakfast/ lunch/ dinner or other personal things. At the end of trip the total kms was 1321 . Driver asked me additional money for 151 kms (121 for the extra kms + 20 kms for him to drive back to his place) . When I confronted the driver that why was he charging us for the kms which he used on daily basis he asked his boss to speak to me who started usung foul language with me. He said the driver is authorised to use 15- 20km daily for his own usage and we should be giving the money . When I said to him that this was not mentioned in terms and conditions of MMT and hence I won’t give the money for which the driver used the car for personal usage, the person on the other end continued using foul language and warned me to give the full money.He then told me he will send some goons to hit me and make sure I am hit badly and bought to his  office. I want compensation from MMT or the cab partner savari.com for mental torture that they have caused me else I will bring this to consumer court. Please note that I have video footage of driver taking the car for his own usage .",1

1109,"I Booked a Phuket holiday package for me and my wife through MMT for our wedding anniversary which was plan all of sudden 3 days before trip. I spoke to MMT team and they gave me offer which I felt was best for this sudden international trip. Everything was great till I landed in Phuket. I waited almost 2 hours at airport as they were waiting for other passenger to arrive. This was one incident which seems normal as it was already mentioned that pick up and drop was on share basis. Once I reached at hotel I felt like I am going to check in some kind of basic rooms 2 star property instead of a 4 star property which was promised in my package. Anyways  It was a 3 star(as per google) property not a 4 star(A big lie by MMT team). After waiting for another 2 hours they  allotted me a room on 7th floor but there lift was not going above 6th floor so literally I left with no option of using stairs with my 25 kg bag. Not a single person was there to help from hotel side. Next: As I am a vegetarian so this problem is specifically for the people like me. In breakfast I was left only with 2 watermelon, 3 types of tetra pack juices, oats and curd which spoiled my 4 days trip everyday in the morning. I meant to say very limited options compare to the non vegetarian people. Now next thing was that on second day we were booked for phi phi island trip. So there was an option for upgrading seats because our seat was in basement of the ship. It was very nominal charges for up gradation but when I asked them for that, they told me that you cannot upgrade because your travel agent do not allow us to do so. It was shocking to hear that. So another 4 hours of round journey was spoiled in that basement of ship. This was the whole story of my trip with MMT. Thank you MMT for making me realize that next time I should never trust on your team.",1

However no refund was received when I raised one more complaint on the 12th of feb, 2019, which was followed by Multiple follow-up calls from my end. However, I received no proper update from the concerned vendor and was initially told that the money was not received by them. I also checked with the concerned bank and was confirmed that the vendor(Makemy trip.com) confirmed that the amount was received by them and that it was not with the bank.

1113,"This is a story of two people who wanted to visit Singapore. We planned this trip for my boyfriend’s birthday. Visiting Singapore Zoo and SEA have been on his bucket list for a long time and I would not miss any opportunity to visit Universal Studios, and thus, the idea of this trip was born. We saved up for a couple of months and were very eagerly looking forward to this trip. We made one mistake while planning this trip, which was choosing MakeMyTrip for our ticketing and visa needs. A mistake which was going to make us terribly regret, ever considering, going on this trip. Here’s a review of my recent harrowing, experience with MakeMyTrip: Firstly, MakeMyTrip claims to provide visa services but does not have the following: An area in their website where you can avail or track the said service(It’s app only for some reason) A toll-free number/extension or email id for visa services Any specific information which you can go through before you avail the service(It’s pay first and worry about it after policy!) First, you pay for the service, which I did and applied for a tourist visa for Singapore, and also uploaded scanned copies of several documents. Then, “someone” is supposed to get in touch with us to take this process further. When? I didn’t know. What happens if you miss the call? Are we supposed to sit by our phone all day? After missing the call, the first time, we received an email from them asking for a list of documents and in the email, a phone number was finally revealed to us which was a toll-free number. This number had an average wait time of 20 minutes(per try) and someone would pick up after your 4th or 5th try if you are lucky. After multiple conversations, a final list of documents was agreed upon which we couriered to them promptly. We were asked to file for Visa separately as we are not related, which is understandable and provide a set of documents each which we did very meticulously provide them with labels and copies, in a futile attempt to make things easier. But then(after receiving our original set of documents), they asked for a series of additional documents which were never mentioned before. According to their visa team as I am a “single lady” traveling to Singapore as a tourist, with my boyfriend, I need to give them the following documents from my Father: A no objection certificate Employment proof Financial documents A govt id proof I have a few questions for their team: Why are these documents needed? I am a 28-year-old, adult. Why was this not mentioned before? Why is there no mention of this in the Singapore embassy website? Or anywhere else on the internet? Their attitude in this process was so callous, that I had no faith left in them, and could not believe that even after providing said documents, I would be able to travel to Singapore. Honestly, at this point of time, it seemed like it was easier to just bring my father along, on my trip. My question to MakeMyTrip is if this is genuinely the case with Singapore tourist visa, why wasn’t I informed before? Do your agents lack this knowledge or is it a standard practice to harass your customers after they are stuck having paid for the service and sending original documents? And in all of the above steps, for every, single, thing, we had to email them multiple times and wait for the call to connect for hours. Even for a basic thing like acknowledging the receipt of our courier(which had our original passports) they took 2 business days.(After bluedart confirmed that it had been delivered). Now let me reveal the worst part. We were dealing with an agent named Kamini Bhasin who left no stone unturned in harassing us throughout this process. We were continuously “judged” by her and asked questions like: Why am I unmarried and not living with my father? How come we both have the same residential address? Why are we traveling together? Are we related by blood? And so on. How is it any of your business? In which century do you live? Is this your hobby? Does your job description involve helping your customers or harassing them? You did an excellent job of trying to strip my identity. According to this lady, “I” do not matter. My documents do not suffice. I either need my father or to be married so that my “husband” can take my “responsibility”. Even when we tried to cancel this service and decided not to go ahead with MakeMyTrip we had to follow up with multiple calls and emails. Finally, we got in touch with a different agent who promptly did this for us and returned our original documents. Dear MakeMyTrip, me and my family have been loyal customers of yours since 2009 and I can assure you that this was the last time any of us would ever use any service provided by you. You made me go through all of this, face severe harassment and anxiety for weeks and made me feel helpless at the same time since my original documents were stuck with you and as mentioned before there was no proper phone number or email id to even get in touch with you. Take action on this now, otherwise, I can assure you that you will be losing many more customers very soon.",1

Their customer support is horrible, no one ever receives the call, neither they respond to e-mails. The app does not provide any update to track the progress of visa. Finally, I was able to reach to one of the customer care and they asked me for more documents just 10 days before the trip! They had all my original documents so I did not have the option to go to any other agent.

We arrived kualalumpur at 6.30 am after a sleepless night and hotel booked from 2 PM. We have to pay extra 90 Ringgit with equal to approx 1700 INR for early checkin. The entire day and evening was in leisure, 2nd day and the last day also was in leisure. Means There is not any single activity for 3 days out of 4 day.   No visit to historical places at kualalumpur. We noticed those people who are travelling through Yatra there are no any leisure in any days.  There flight timing ang Hotel check in timing was also matched. No interest of customer satisfaction. They said one day stay at Pattaya but we arrived pataya at 4.30 AM and transfer from pataya to bangkok at 11.00 am. They took us to Pattaya only for sleep, we just wake up did our breakfast and returned to Bangkok.  We went for Bangkok for 2 days but only cruise dinner was there in 2 days and no complimentary breakfast. Horrible air asia flights and horrible experience with make my trip. Never be recommended. Just have a look of our Journey 27th to 30th January in Kuala Lumpur 27th January: They whole day and evening not any single activity 28th January: They whole day not any single activity, cultural show at evening 29th January: Sunway lagoon for the day 30th January: They whole day not any single activity, Flight at Night for Bangkok. 31st January to 2nd February in Thailand 31st January: Reached Pattaya in 4.30 AM, After breakfast return to Bangkok, waste the full Day at night cruise dinner. 1st February: They whole day and evening not any single activity 2nd February: Return Flight on 00.05 AM, Means only 5 minutes in Bangkok in the last day.",1
1118,"I have been using MMT App and booking flight tickets from long now, issue were'nt much before, On time services and booked tickets were shared through different communication channels. Tried booking a ticket 3 times when thrice the amount deducted from account, when tried chatting multiple times, heard of money getting refunded in 48-72 hours. Just to avoid any risk tried calling their customer support where I heard of 12 Business days, are guys not even talking to each other or is there a process set? FAQ: Do I keep waiting for these 12 days to let price rise and book a ticket in higher expense, Should I be responsible for my hiked tickets, While I understand Technical Issue but not sure if you guys have customer issue resolution on time. My ticket was opened and closed even when my issue persists! Service query id: 190130002836 Will not use MMT from now and will not recommend to anyone",1
1119,It was my mistake while booking instead of selecting 2 adults unmindfully I didn’t select any. When called the hotel they were arguing about charging me but Anand Raj of Make my trip went out of his way to help me. He not only coordinated with the hotel ensured by checking with me until the last minute i was completely satisfied. So greatful to have been dealt by you,5

1122,"Never ever book anything with Make My Trip - They are just here to make money and do day light robbery. I booked an Air Ticket from Bangalore to Bali, I don't have a last name and the Make My Trip portal doesn't take the booking without a last name, it doesn't have any warning symbol as well saying 'If you don't have a last name, Do this or that' Where as GoIbibo has that option. I had travelled to Singapore previously booking an Air ticket via Goibibo without a last name and was successful. At MMT I booked my ticket giving my First name as a last name - VARSHA VARSHA, after I booked the tickets just to be on a safer side I called MMT and they asked me to send the passport details to clarify with the Airlines - I was in a doubt because My friends have had worst experiences with MMT so called the Airlines Directly - Airlines people told that the MMT people will cancel the ticket and rebook it for me. As I was waiting I received an email from MMT saying I have to cancel the tickets and the penalties will be borne by me - My 16, 000 INR was deducted as penalty just because they had no option of proceeding without a Last name (Nor they had a disclaimer before proceeding) It's my sincere request for the travellers to not book any kind of service with MMT - They are here just to make money and use those penalty money to pay the celebrity brand ambassadors for ads.",1

We booked the hotel by seeing the photos they had shown through MMT. It was totally a disaster ! The rooms were very pathetic . The doors were not proper, the sheets were used by some other guests, lot of insects in the room, very untidy toilet, no hot water as committed & after shouting at them they gave water in bucket, Free Breakfast offered & we had to walk to nearby hotel & was not coordinated properly. So pls don't believe Make My Trip like I believed. Pls do book through other sites who cares for its customers. I tried contacting make my trip customer care & couldn't reach them directly. The service by Sree Simran Palace is pathetic & the behaviour of staff is also very bad. Don't choose this hotel. It was noticed that the rate given to us was 1500 per room for one day & one of my relative extended the room for one more day & they been given for Rs. 1000/-.

1127,A very unprofessional and pathetic experience. booked cab service from makemytrip. com for 1830h on 23 december 2018 for trip from IGI international airport T3 to Greater noida. Informed driver on telephone as soon as my flight arrived from Srilanka at 1800hrs. Cab fetched up only at 1905 hrs. A delay of 35 mins. We were kept waiting outside the airport for 35 minutes. To add insult to injury the driver parked the cab at Parking first floor and refused to pick us up from pick up point at departure. My wife had to walk all the way up with a leg problem. After lodging complaint with makemytrip and escalating the matter got a poor response from them. These guys are cheating the public and are responsible for serious deficiencies of service. My advice to all go for Uber or Ola avoid makemytrip,1
1128,"Worst service ever by MMT. Booked my Holiday trip with MMT. Shared my pick up details 15days before. Reached delhi airport at 11am. Got a vehicle at about 2 pm. Then again I was asked to change the vehicle due to my safety issues... Again waited for 45 minutes standing on roadside with my family. At about 3.40pm we moved towards nainital. Reached there at about 12 o clock in the night. A 2 star hotel (hotel suntej plaza) was given to me for nainital which looked like a slum. It was actually not a hotel even.The room was like a store room, sofa was broken, the blankets and sofa covers were torn. The bedsheets were not clean, there was no water, the tv was not functioning, no towels were given, no soap and sampoos were given and charged 2000inr per day for that room which isnot worth paying even 600 rs per day. room service was poor. No room heater was given. Geaser was not functioning. The window was broken. A big jug was given instead of a mug. The toilet was dirty. Overall it was a nightmare for me. Besides these MMT team did not help me. I complained about this from morning and they didn't resolve the issue instead they said me that they have been trying to resolve. At about 6.00pm they came out with a resolution. They said that everyone tried to contact me but my phone was not in out of network coverage. I could not just believe when I can make and receive many calls how the MMT team could not contact me.. ultimately it was proved by MMT that I was the person responsible for my own inconvenience and not MMT. While booking for Corbett, I asked the representative about jungle safari. He said that it is in the itinerary. But as it was shown as Corbett history tour I asked about it 3-4 times but it was told that, it is being shown by default and jungle safari will be provided. But on 24th dec at about 9pm when I asked about it, it was told me that it is not in the itinerary. I was shocked.. finally they are offering me ₹500 as compensation towards the in conveniences. Overall... Make My Trip has Spoiled my trip. I feel like I have wasted my money... The MMT team gave me a nightmare. Never expected such kind of behaviour from MMT team. I visited many of the places by myself and those were not included in itineraries. I am never going with them ever after also I will not recommend any of my friends to go with MMT. Even those who travel with MMT I will tell my experience and share the photographs and will ask them not to go with MMT.",1

Hotel was so far from Shimla, This is the worst location and we are cheated to opt for this rest house.  My first fool transaction in my life. It is the worst location.

I canceled my Booking in the night, & I go back after halfway done because The way is not secure to drive & visit the hotel. MMT never cross check about the location that hotels location is fine or not, GPS location was wrong & very difficult to reach. MMT very bad service from your side, I will never suggest anyone to book the room from MMT because you never check about hotel location that customer can easily find the location or safe full reach their destination.

When I tried to complain about this issue to the customer service. First the call did not get connected. Secondly, when I told them the problem they said that they will fix it but they never did.

1137,"From the day one of my booking I was requesting the mmt customer care executives to change my package date due to less time of validity of passport which was not mentioned in terms and conditions while buying the package which was sent after the payment of amount for the trip, since it’s my first international holiday trip I was not aware of passport validity. After requesting so many times they didn’t do anything to support me not even changes in dates to travel . They are looting the people with out giving clear information before booking, I lost my hard earned money which I was saving from so many months, they are cheating people in advanced manner, for middle class people like me it’s a trauma. And they are so proudly saying as an open statement that they cannot return a single rupee and its ur mistake not ours, I request you all never opt for this fraud company to take advantage and do robbery of ur hard earned money below ur nose.",1
1138,"I am writing this to share my horrible experience with Makemytrip. This was the first time I was using their services. Back in September, after going through the holiday packages offered on their website, I was interested in booking one for Paris and Switzerland(ex Delhi dtd 26 Jan 2019). I got in touch with their sales expert to discuss the details. My major concerns were if payment could be done by international card and the visa process. I was advised in positive regarding payment and assured expert visa assistance. As I reside outside India, I decided to apply for my own visa and required their assistance only for my partner residing in Delhi. After finalizing the deal, I visited the online payment link and international card option was not working. I got in touch with the sales expert and was advised that the system is down. I was told to arrange payment through Indian Bank account and as early as possible as the slots were getting filled. Painstakingly I arranged the money from my Indian account and made the payment. Soon I was contacted by their visa expert who advised to arrange the necessary documents for my partner by November to apply to the French embassy. He provided us a checklist of required documents which were more than the ones mentioned in the French consulate website. However considering he is an expert, we took his advice and arranged all of them. He double checked all the documents and my partner submitted it to the consulate. In a couple of days we got a rejection letter. Meantime the visa I applied for myself was approved. Perplexed I asked him the reason(Consulate rejection letter was vague) and the future course of action. He advised to reapply with the same documents and a better cover letter. I was shocked to hear his response and was skeptical that it will work. I did my own research and the only solution I could find was to sponsor my partner and that would increase the probability of acceptance. I was amused at how I have to advise the expert on the future course of action. Then he provided me with a list of documents required for sponsorship. He sent me a draft sponsorship letter and asked me to just fill in the name and other personal details. The draft was filled with grammatical errors and contained inadequate information. I did a bit of research and wrote the letter myself. Sadly it got rejected again. The expert advised to reapply without giving any directions of corrective action. Feeling completely dejected and not wanting to waste more money on application fees, I decided to change the booking to another destination which has visa on arrival. But the sales expert refused stating that they have already paid vendors for my booking and told only option available for me is to cancel the booking(incurring 20% of the package cost). I was really disappointed with the overall treatment. They assured me of false promises, provided me with ill advice regarding visa and were totally dismissive regarding any other solution. I have used various travel agencies in the past but never faced such unprofessionalism, incompetence and indifference.",1
1139,"Stay away from a person called Shashvat Barbhaya and a woman called Avneet Kaur. They are basically useless. I booked my first trip to Goa with MMT. I clearly asked Shashvat to book one hotel in South Goa and one in North Goa. This man has probably never been to Goa, but talked like he stayed there. He booked both my hotels in North Goa. After paying the entire amount for the trip, the booking ID he provided wouldn't show up in ""My Trips"" section on the MMT site. When I tried connecting to the customer support, they asked for the booking ID and when I provided them that, they said that the booking was invalid. As if that wasn't enough, I requested and paid for hotel-to-hotel transfers for which Shashvat confirmed, but never provided. I followed up with Avneet, but she too was of no help. She kept saying someone will call, we have raised a complaint, but nothing happened. So after paying Shashvat for interhotel transfers, we had to pay another cab to transfer us simply because Shashvat was too busy not doing his job. And Avneet was too busy not caring. The hotel we stayed in Goa were La Sunila Suites and Resort Terra Paraiso. La Sunila was okay, nothing 4-star about it, but Terra Paraiso was simply pathetic. They don't provide any toiletries. After checking in, we called them nearly 5 times to get basic help. The mattress that we slept on was like one taken out of a dump yard. Full of stains that I wouldn't have noticed if I didn't ask someone to clean the bed while I supervised. Overall, people like Avneet Kaur and Shashvat Barbhaya need desperate training in handling customers. They made our first vacation, after 8 years, a living nightmare. Please avoid them because they don't give a bird's eye for our hard-earned money. All they care about is to be useful until you book, then after booking they simply switch off their common-sense. Stay away from MMT.",1

Without having the availability information, I dont know how they quote a package. After reaching out for multiple times for 2 days - finally I get a message that ""Sorry the package is sold out"".

1144,"They show big badges of ""Best Price Guarantee"" on International Flight booking saying they will offer 10x the difference between Other Travel Agencies price if less price is found within 24 hours. Let me explain why this is a big fraud - This thing is not eligible on Flights booked with a Deal code. Now here is a trap, any flight you select will trap with a nice ""Rs. 1000 off"" code already applied and the price you see is after that discount. Now no person in the world would even want to pay without that deal code. Chances are that you will try to find a better deal code to apply on your flight. As soon as you do that you are un-intentionally going out from this BPG. Although it is 10x the difference but maximum they offer is Rs. 10000. I found a flight after I booked flight on MakeMyTrip which was Rs. 5000 less on Other website but it's only 2x for me. Money is refunded in your MakeMyTrip wallet and not in your original Form of payment. Never ever trust their big banner offers.

1151,"I had booked a holiday package to Hyderabad from Kolkata and booked flight tickets of round trip on airindia through make my trip. Starting with the flight tickets- I had chosen 3 seats for us through Make My Trip(MMT) with extra charges. While doing a web check-in I came to know that my paid seats have been allotted to someone else. On calling MMT they put me on hold for mote than 30mins and said that Airindia has no option to book seats. But MMT had shown me the seat matrix at the time of booking, let me book the seats with 500 extra bucks. Now they just apologised and said that I have to chhose whatever seats are left from the airlines website. Moreover they agreed to return only Rs.400 not Rs.500. Next about the trip- the hotel was not upto the mark although they charged around 22000/ for 2 adults and 1 kid for a 3 nights package without flight fares. Hotel and travel was included. Although they charged for 3 persons.. the hotel could not provide an extra cot. I had to share a single bed with my 8 years old son. About the sight seeing.. the MMT relationship officer had confirmed that I can cover some of the site seeing on the first day. But the travel agency denied this and said it was only for pick up on the first day. We had to pay extra money to get some sightseeing on the first day as we didn't want to waste the time.

After which they back out.The number shared is switched off you waste 30 mins calling the driver then customer care of mmt from the airport. Then the driver refuses to go to places which are nearby like kothi 10 kms from manali, gulaba 25 kms from manali or manikaran 75 kms. We booked another cab paid 4000 Rs to go to Gulaba to see snowfall. You waste time deciding a new itinerary every day. Then what do you do with the 1250 kms limit that you have paid for. Nothing it’s the drivers call we finished the entire tour in 750 kms! The driver parks his car in the first parking lot that he sees asking us to walk 2-3 kms in solang valley or vaishisth mandir whereas all other cars go upto the spot. He has just one reason that his car is not local so people will damage his car OMG. The driver locks the car trunk refuses till his night charges are paid even when he know we were 2 ladies & two kids 4 & 7 years travelling.

1154,"Horribly spoilt Holiday by MMT 5 day Holiday from 24th to 28th October 2018 which was planned by MMT was the worst experience of my life. Each day I had to struggle and get upset. Day 1: Arrival in Guwahati - We were picked up from Airport by a badly maintained Taxi arranged by MMT through Hotel Rains Inn, Guwahati. Day2: MMT arranged for a taxi through vendor. Driver was rude and refused to pay Parking fee which was part of package. He stopped the vehicle midway and we had to sortout the issues with MMT call centre. Finally, the driver dropped us at hotel without any sight seeing and returned back. Day3: New driver came and we asked him to compensate Day2 sight seeing by taking us to a location. Initially Vendor agreed, however, later MMT sent an email to the vendor to collect additional payment of Rs.1500. After this, the same vendor who had agreed to compensate, demanded additional payment of Rs.1500. There was no one in MMT to help resolve the issue. Day4: Hotel Rain Inn, Guwahati informed that there is no communication from MMT for Drop at airport whereas the same was part of package. MMT call centre refused airport drop. After much discussion and argument basis given Itinerary, MMT informed Hotel Rain INN to arrange for Airport Drop on Day 5 Day 5: As per confirmed Itinerary, sedan car was alocated for airport drop, whereas, hotel arranged for wagonR which was insufficient to carry 4 suitcases!. Hotel informed that MMT has not specified the type of vehicle. Again discussion and argument. Entire trip was spoilt. Instead of enjoying holiday, I was struggling to get the desired facility each day. Worst experience of my life. I will never avail MMT for holiday and will never recommend any one to do so.",1
1155,"I Sukumar Chatterjee, have booked one room in HOTEL BALAJI ATITHI ASHRAY at VARANASI on 5th July vide PNR-0035758770 & Booking ID -NH2004287899521 for my three nights stay i.e. from 24/10/18 to 27/10/18 by full amount of Rs 6416/- in advance. Accordingly I alongwith my family reached the hotel by auto at morning of 24/10/18 from Varanasi Railway Station, Upon reaching there I found the hotel is locked from outside and on enquiry I came to know that the ownership of the hotel has been transferred  to another person and the second person was not running the hotel after that. At this I was not in a position to think about what to do. I have left no stone unturned to contact with the the phone no. available in the booking slip(8765620762) but nobody received my call. A nearby shopkeeper gave me the Phone No. of the new owner. I called him and stated about my booking but he told me that he cannot do anything and also told me that he will not entertain the liability of booking of the previous owner . At this moment I had no other way but to go to the Police Station to lodge a Complaint. When I was about to lodge the Complaint, I received a call from Shri Shivam(8808451452) of Gokul Grand Hotel at Sonarpura, Varanasi and told me to come to his place where he will arrange for my accomodation. Astonishingly he alloted me a very small room instead of four bedded standard room and the free breakfast which was supposed to be served free of cost was never given to us. Actually in a double bedded room, two persons of my family were forced to sleep on Mattress on Floor. I just want to ask MakeMyTrip.com why I have been cheated in such a way after paying the full amount for my stay in advance. Should I approach to the Consumer Forum? I am simply requesting to everybody just not to book any hotels in India through MakeMyTrip.com as this agency is simply a Fraud and Cheat!",1

The useless customer care says they cant help me with any thing here. And keep asking for the artifact as if one records all his steps while making a booking. Totally crap site and worst customer service. Avoid it totally,1

I booked for my goa trip. one 4 star hotel in goa named ‘The park calingute’. and had a great experience book with MMT. they offered very large dosicunt. when we reach hotel we crosscheck exact price and yeas we got great discount from online booking for sure. we also asked MMT to help us with bill invoice. They are very perticular about customer query, they generate ticket for the problem and then resolved in time. this was the thing I like most about them. Also they take care of your booking completely, they call you ask for confirmation, ask for modification and everyhing they do is just in systematic way. after completing my saty over there I got 1000R.S payback in my MMT wallet as well. this was surpirsing and pleasent. of course. I strongly suggest this website for hotel booking not sure about flight booking though . You can totally rely on iformation given on the site. in my case hotel pictures and facilities were exactly same as one mentioned on the website.",4

I panicked, tried calling(i had international roaming on for one day just to do these bookings), email but I didn't receive an urgent response. So I booked the one ticket that I required from a travel agent in india.  After which I get an email saying both my tickets are active. None have been cancelled. When I told them now I have booked again from elsewhere because I did not get a response from them they asked me to cancel the bookings. From my side on my app both tickets showed cancelled so I had nothing to cancel. Airlines as usual said you have to contact the travel agent as you have not booked directly with the airlines. Its been 4 days and I haven't received any email on update from them. I am so disappointed.  I will never use or recommend #makemytrip henceforth. It's better to book directly with the airline or with a travel agent.  I am requesting them repeatedly that I am not in the country and so I cannot be contacted by phone so please communicate through email. But they just dont seem interested. Also I hope someone helps me out with my refunds! I have attached a screenshot of the status of my cancellation. It is still on level 1/4. In the first place I didn't cancel both tickets and now they don't even revert. I should be charged cancellation for just one ticket. Please revert makemytrip and be responsible!",1

Have promised to book us on another flight, but still no steps taken on their behalf. This is an International flight and our Visa depends on such bookings. They are thieves. The customer support staff is brainless! One of their executive told me to wait for 48 hours for an action to be taken. When I refused, he taunted me by saying if you can spend two minutes in talking to me, then you can definitely wait 48 hours!!!! This is the type of service they give people.. atleast provide the customer with an end to end result! I am furious at such service. What's worse, they won't even accept it to be their fault!

1162,We had the worst experience by booking on make my trip. These people don't have value for you neither for your money and no human hearts . We booked a hotel for 2 days in Jim Corbett to celebrate a birthday . We had our bookings made 15 days before that date. But there was an emergency at home and our grandmother passed away. We requested for rescheduling or even partial refund but these people weren't ready to make any arrangements . It is not the correct site for booking tickets. These people openly claim to refund 100% money are pure liars. The website is not customer friendly at all,1

1164,"I had a very good opinion on MMT but all destroyed with the single issue that I have faced during my visit to Malaysia and Thailand. They suppose to arrange a ferry from Phuket to Phi-Phi Island for 25th of Sep. They have shared the voucher details, however it was mentioned as TBA against ferry, when I asked they said that it will be taken care and not to worry. I have landed at Phuket and MMT Partners were waiting to receive us, we'll. They said that you have landed at Phuket late and ferry can't be arranged now, better u take an accommodation here itself instead of going to Phi-Phi. It was a real shocking one to hear as we have already paid for the accommodation in Phi-Phi and if we don't go it will get canceled and on top of that I have to pay for the hotel here for which MMT will not involve. I called customer care immediately and they said I'll get a call back in 5 minS, do u think it will happen? I immediately pushed those partners to drop me at pier as per the plan, luckily the driver was good, he took us to RASSADA PIER and I was asked to pay including the return trip.. All done, we reached Phi-Phi without MMT support. It's time for MMT to refund the ferry charges. Their approach, After 4 hours ( suppose to call in 5 mins ), sorry for the inconvenience caused and we would refund your amount as you managed the booking on your own. Next day from other guy, Since we couldn't arrange the booking for onward trip, we can only refund that and not your return trip :-) Partial money will be credited to your MMT Wallet and the balance to Credit card This is how they work and they are purely money minded. IT'S  a common sense that if onward ticket is not arranged, how can one think that atleast return ticket will be arranged by MMT. Such a shame on them. All along, think twice but do not go with MMT.",1

Due to health reasons I cancelled the booking before time stipulated by GoAir and they promptly refunded INR 3, 593 to MakeMyTrip for paying me back.

1168,"I recently returned to India from the United States and booked a round trip airfare(BLR-DEL, Sep 10 to Sep 24) on MakemyTrip.com(Booking ID: NF22697137796619). However, I had to re-schedule the outbound leg on Sep 9 evening(due to the Bharat Bandh) for my flight on Sep 10 to Sep 11, owing to circumstances clearly out of my control as the logistics to and from the airport in Bangalore and Delhi would have been tricky. For an original round trip itinerary worth INR 6818, I was charged an astronomical INR 4900 additionally, purportedly for schedule change for a single leg by MakeMyTrip. When I asked for a date change fee waiver in light of the untenable circumstances that made to-and-fro logistics to the airport difficult, it was summarily rejected by MakemyTrip's customer service. What's worse, when I called the airline(Vistara), they told me that had I booked directly through them they would have put me on the next day flight without any fee. However, since my booking was not in fact re-scheduled or canceled(I was issued a different PNR/e-ticket no. for my Sep 11 flight), they were treating the Sep 10 booking as a no-show and could not make any refunds. I called MakemyTrip customer care and narrated the issue in detail, but despite assurances of a quick resolution(by customer care rep Divya who promised to get back to me within two hours) I did not hear from them. I feel that I was being unduly penalised for using MMT and that I should not be charged a change fee when the change that I made was due to circumstances beyond my control and more so when the airline would have acted differently in the same situation. I was informed to the contrary by the customer service rep when I called in on Sep 9 evening to reschedule. I requested MMT by writing to their customer service and copying the CEO, Deep Kalra to please consider the unfairness of this charge and issue a refund. However, I received a stock response from one Ritu Sharma(who claimed to represent Team - Customer Delight?!) saying that MMT did not owe me anything and that I should approach the airline directly when MMT was in fact the one to collect cancellation and date change charges(amounting to INR 4900) on account of just issuing a new ticket rather than actively changing the flight date(for the outbound leg). More aggravation followed when I discovered that they had in fact neither canceled nor rescheduled my outbound flight from Bangalore as the airline had taken me for a ""no-show"" and canceled my ticket entirely(the return flight from Delhi to Bangalore was on the same ticket no). I discovered this when I tried to do a web check-in, which was unsuccessful. This makes it amply clear that MakeMyTrip made no attempt to either cancel or re-schedule the outbound leg of my booking. Vistara had to re-issue my ticket so I could fly the return leg, which goes to prove the fraudulent behaviour of this portal in collecting charges for services that were not provided and misrepresenting facts to the customers. They kept on telling me wrongly that I had'canceled' the outbound leg when I merely're-scheduled' which is what I intended. In fact they have separate re-schedule and cancel buttons on their mobile application, and I clearly remember using the former. I intend to take this matter to the consumer court and would like to advise everyone to please, please stay away.",1

1173,"Worst ever experience with Makemytrip. Experience is really bad right from the discussion with the executive. I actually booked the trip for my parents and I wanted to have more places to visit in every location that I am visiting. The places that I opted for are Delhi, Agra, Rishikesh, Haridwar and Dehradun. I have made this explicit initially itself but when the CS executive sent me the itenery list for the locations that I asked for, she sent very minimal places for every location. Say 2-3 places at max. When I asked for more, it was too many to and fro to make her understand my requirement. Finally, I got frustrated and I came up with the full plan for 8 days and gave her. Her work is just to send this to the backend team to get the quote for it. The amount she quoted was bit high but I did not worry about it much. I actually wanted to have a good trip for my parents. I believed Makemytrip would do it better. When it came to the payment stage, she told me that the driver would drive only from 9am - 6pm and not for the rest of the time even if we had to travel from one city to another. When I asked about this again for clarification, she told me that it is outstation drive, driver can start by 6am also but she is not ready to give a written confirmation for this as their policy does not suport this. I believed this to some extent and finally paid initial amount. While doing the payment, I asked her to provide the cab driver who knows English / Tamil as we are going by separate cab and my parents does not know Hindi. She told that we can try for that but cannot assure. Based on this confirmation, I made the payment. The day came when my parents went for the trip. I called the driver in the contant number shared before they landed. Apparently the driver does not know anything in English. He just know two things in English. 1) Say a place is closed. 2) say yes yes yes for anything that you ask just like Rajnikanth did in one movie. My parents were really tensed to hear this. Just think of it. On the first day of the trip, driver saying that all the places in day1 are closed. I then had to speak to the travels(to whom makemyrrip has vended this out) and the makemytrip executive to understand. Actually, 1 out of 4 places in the first day are closed but the driver told all of them are closed. I got help from some of my Hindi speaking friends to talk to the driver and finally made him understand that the places are open & he took my parents for sightseeing. And thank God, day 2 is booked with Delhi tourism and it was very fair. Again it is day3 and the nuisance started. Day3 -> started from Delhi and travelled to Rishikesh and we had to visit Triveni Ghat in the evening for Ganga Arthi. Driver parked the car in Rishikesh hotel and made my parents believe that they have to walk a little bit to reach the Ghat. Actually, it is 1 km from hotel to Ram Jhulla, more than 0.5 km to cross Ram Jhulla and then get a share auto to reach the Triveni Ghat. They have to do the same process to reach the hotel again after Ganga Arthi. Driver just took rest in hotel and made the vendor believe that he took us for sightseeing Triveni Ghat. Day 4 -> Morning, first word he told is 2 places closed which is actually open. I had to then talk to the reception guy, get information and then tell him it is open. He then showed some random places generally and tell that this is the sightseeing places. Eg. He showed a small mountain with some water telling that this is NeerGarh waterfall. When my dad asked the localate and then told him that we have to go 1km more, he fought with that guy. He also does not say where he is going to my parents before going. Only when he reaches, they will know. He speaks over phone all time, uses pawn. etc. troublesome guy. I finally reached out to the vendor to change the guy but they are not ready to accept all this, and after so many discussion, they are ready to change the guy on day7 while the complaint was raised on day4.  With no other way, I reached out to Makemytrip and they were not ready to take up the complaint. They asked me to talk to the vendor. So bad of them. Driver changed only on day 7 as the vendor told. New driver was bit okay with English and the trip was better after that. Some callouts to people looking for Makemytrip. Dont believe in Makemytip. They are fraud people. They just vend out stuff to other company and we believe in their name while booking. I asked for English speaking driver and even if they know if it not possible / less possible, they did not inform me about that earlier. They just got the money and made me struggle.f All the hotels that they committed were supposed to 3+  but hotels in Rishikesh & Haridwar were just like a dunjen. Very poor customer support in case of an issue. They took 2 days to resolve an issue when 25% of my trip has completed. Dont go to Makemytip please guys. I got cheated. I have spent lots of money and the result is just frustration. Even the customer service of vendor is poor. They don't pick your call looking at your number. Really bad. Makemytrip does not care for you. They care just for your money. I will never plan for any more trip with them.",1
1174,"Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you to express my deepest disappointment over the way I have been treated in your organization, all thanks to your wonderful team of unprofessional colleagues who have no sense of customer service and by any standards should not be working in this field. This is to bring to your kind notice that I had booked a trip to Thailand Magical Pattaya & Bangkok – Super Saver(Pattaya & Bangkok) through your esteemed establishment Make My Trip from 19th July 2018 to 24th July 2018.My trip ID for the same was NL206141277095.The trip booking was done by Ms Mradula Dubey and during my booking it was told to me that visit to Coral Island is included in my itinerary, but when I received the final itinerary two days before my trip, visit to Coral Island was not mentioned in it, so I wrote a mail to Ms Mradula Dubey and also discussed the matter to her on phone, where I got the the assurance that the matter will be solved with in half an hour, but nothing was done, I also came in touch with several other representative of your team at call center, but the response was still nil. After going through a long mental tension and harassment of two days I got the corrected itinerary on 18th July 2018 at 1:30pm. This was not enough and when I was in a Hotel Sunshine Pattaya on 22nd July 2018 having my breakfast at 8:30am, on the same time your local representative named Mr Prateek Jagtap forced me to leave the hotel and come along with him leaving my breakfast half done with my wife and 3 years old child. My actual check out time from the hotel was at 12:30 as per my itinerary, but this man took me to Jems Plaza where I had to spend 2 hours which was neither included in my itinerary nor were we interested in it. Sir I must mention here that people go holidays for mental and physical relaxation and for enjoyment and fun, but the way your team deals with client and the blunder mistakes that your team making are totally un tolerable. It is requested to you to either act against such employees or else we need to go to the court for compensation against the mental harassment, tension and trouble that we faced during the trip. Will forward the same mail to Mr Rajesh Magow and Mr Deep Kalra, unbelievable the CEO of this company is least bothered about their customer service, no action been taken since last one month. If the CEO is not bothered I never understand the concern how the company is running. Rakesh Chauhan",1
1175,"We booked a cab from coimbatore to coonoor on 15 th Aug. The booking online was not difficlult but reaching them Was Almost impossible as the number was never reachable, so Everytime I had to call flight booking& they transfered my call to cab booking. We received the payment confirmation Email but We did not received any details of the cab or driver or confirmation of The trip over SMS which We should receive before trip starts, The funniest part is that We received the SMS confirmation of The trip after 5 days of trip. Finally the driver called us before 10 mins of trip start time& We had to call him 3-4 times to guide him about the route. After boarding the cab We came to know that driver is from mysore& he is coming first time to coimbatore, he was asking us to guide him with the route, before booking the cab I requested for a driver who is Aware about the Local routes bcoz We are not from the place. Worst part was that the drivers phone was switch off bcoz he had no charging facility in the cab, There was no Device where he could follow d GPS. Finally We had to guide him at every cut& on every Road, Thank God We had back up charger& working GPS. On the way to coonoor the driver was trying take over other vehicles which was not at all safe on Hilly roads, We stopped him many times. It was a one day round trip, so We reached back near coimbatore around 6:20 PM, We were all the way guiding the driver with GPS inspite of this he took many wrong turns& We roamed around coimbatore for more than 2 hrs, wheras as he should have taken only 30-40 mins to reach our hotel. All tiered, We reached around 8:20 pm at our hotel, After full payment, The Driver asked us to pay him 250 Rs extra for night allowance, whreas it was clearly mentioned in the confirmation Email that night allowance is payed after 9pm, After all days struggle We had to wait in rain, We called customer service for clarification& inspite of all this the drivers agency Was not letting us go without extra payout.

1176,"I want to convey this to all the people around the globe to not use the make my trip cab services. One of the worst cab service providers. They are known for making frauds through these services. I booked a round trip from Pune to mumbai with 3 places of sightseeing. The whole trip was followed by google maps and the distance travelled was also tracked. But at the end of the travel the driver charged me for extra 40 kms travelled which originally was not more than 10 kms. On complaining the driver refused and the travel agency refused for any support. When I complained this to make my trip services. They took a week to investigate and at last replied only with an apology and no refund. They are the worst service providers in cabs. My request to all, Never travel with them.",1
1177,"Does a well known website have to lie to earn profits? It would seem so, from the experience we had with makemytrip.com. The website had information on a hotel which enticed my friends and me to book that hotel. Basically, makemytrip.com gave a totally misleading description of the hotel. When we went there, it was so bad that, even though we had booked and paid in advance for two nights, we checked out after the first night itself. One would assume that makemytrip.com would have checked the hotels before listing them - but, to us, it does not seem so. When I complained to makemytrip.com they sent a reply saying that we ""apologize for all the inconvenience caused. As per our telephonic conversation, we would like to inform you that, we have shared your feedback with our management team, we will take care in future you would not be facing any such issues going forward."" However I wanted to know the specific action'the management team' would be taking but'sorry, we cant do that' was the reply. Emails were exchanged for quite a few days and I kept on escalating the matter. Finally I got a reply that said, 'Considering your valuable feedback, we have blocked inventory of hotel-xxxx today around 5:06 PM and as a result no customer would be able to book this hotel on MMT site/app as the hotel would show as sold out for all dates."" I thought excellent stuff and told them so. At least, other travellers would not have to face the same horrible experience we had. However, after a week or so, just for the heck of it, I tried to book that hotel. And, voila, the booking went through on makemytrip.com and I paid for the booking and got a confirmatory mail from makemytrip.com. Of course, I cancelled it immediately thereafter and got my money back. For good measure, I also cancelled another hotel booking done by me on makemytrip.com for a hotel in Chennai and booked the same hotel immediately again though another website! Now, there is studied silence from makemytrip.com after I have further escalated the matter. Well, they can be silent, not me.",1

1180,"I booked a hotel ticket for 4 adults for 2 nights stay at mumbai at hotel Ashok Deluxe service apt. 2BHK without kitchen. At the first page the price on display was Rs. 11, 666 . As I proceeded to the checkout page the price on display was Rs. 13, 821.  Both of these prices were lower than most other sites. Finally, when I applied gift card, the price shot up to Rs. 17, 915. I had bought this gift card from another site worth Rs. 10K which I could have otherwise redeemed on Amzon for an equivalent value purchase. But Makemytrip scandalously shot the price up when I applied this Gift card stating their policy. I effectively lost Rs. 4500 worth of Gift card value which was purchased. By this time I was so distraught searching hotels that I went ahead and booked the ticket anyhow. I later checked and found that on Hotels.com the price was lower. So, I raised an issue with them asking for 2X refund against their claim of best price anywhere. I provided all screenshots that they asked for. They acknowledged and yet later they shot down the claim stating that they need one more screenshot which was not possible to provide as it would be in a back date. They made this an ""EXCUSE"" to deny their promise. As it is I was very upset on having lost Rs. 4500 worth of gift card value and now they even denied their 2X refund promise. Never trust this site on face value. Until you have paid the actual amount you'll not know what the actual price is going to be. NEVER BUY THEIR GIFT CARDS. Thanks,",1

I have no problem with the policy but how MMT people can keep such hotels with low reputation the customer just trust them blindly and when I called them to do complain about the same I had to call them thrice and was waiting on hold for long time and even after putting so much efforts the result what I got was zero.

Make my trip is best site for hotel booking in india and also in make my trip site there are real photos of hotel rooms. so I recommend for hotel booking please log in in make my trip .MMT also gives additional wallet balance on 1st booking.,4
1183,I was planning to visit Murudeshwar in July month based on my search in MakeMyTrip app after 2 days they sent me a notification of 30% off on hotels booking with my. I liked the offer and booked the hotel assuming that I got a great deal. On my arrival at hotel I saw a board with 50 percent it was surprisingly for me. When I enquired got to know from July till September they roll out such offers due to rainy season less visitors are expected. So deals I got on mmt was not even genuine and after including taxes I only got,3
1184,The team is good and problem-solving as I'm going by air for the first time they helped me in clearing my all queries and patiently listening all my queries and answered them very politely and also send the boarding pass and the tickets again. Thank you,5
1185,"Makemytrip booking ID NC770339739646069 Cab from Deolali Maharashtra to Mumbai Airport. Advance payment made. The late night nightmare. The booking was for a family of four adults with one check in and four carry-ons in a Toyota Innova or similar cab. This was to be late night cab to cover a distance of 170 kms to catch an early morning flight. It was to be a 3 to 3and half hr journey and I had catered for 6 hr between start of journey and the flight. There was moderate to heavy rain forecasted. The following unfolded. The ride was outsourced to some local ride. We got no confirmation of the vehicle or the driver details till about one hr before the journey, and that too after repeated inquiry from my side. The cab as well as driver were changed at the last moment. Makemytrip had provided me different details. A much smaller cab than the one booked for came, finally, and was barely able to accommodate us and the luggage. The vehicle was an Ertiga. We suffered a flat one hour into the journey at 2am. Turns out that the tyre had suffered previous damage and a hasty slipshod repair had been carried out. The spare wheel was damaged too and hence totally unusable! Means we were virtually stranded in an unknown location late at night in rain with two ladies and a broken down cab with no spare wheel. Luckily there was a closed gas station nearby with a helpful elderly gentleman who on seeing the plight of our family agreed to help by waking up the young boy of the adjoining puncture shop who had locked himself inside for the night. Incidentally, immediately after that gas station the'Ghat section' began with no gas or puncture station for many many miles. The wheel removal tool in the cab was non-functional. The driver did not have enough money for the replacement tube. I had to buy that. Earlier I had paid for the fuel for the cab. After a  more than two hour delay we finally resumed the journey without a spare wheel, in dark and rain, with prayer on our lips and heart. We barely made it to the flight. I have changed my travel service provider.",1
1186,"I booked a flight through mmt for my colleague using my company’s international credit card. When the payment didnt go through, I had to call the bank to allow authorization and when they did, the only seat available for july 20 2018 was taken and the next consecutive flight for aug 5 was selected for air asia and the payment went through. It was the issue of the website and not from neither the bank nor my end.Flight cost was Inr 2093. Airasia penalty inr 723 Mmt penalty inr 300 Convenience fees inr 350 Insurance inr 259 The refund offered to me was inr 443. I called air asia and had this problem spoken to and they decided to refund the fees of inr 723 with almost no effort and gave a letter of payment refund. I called mmt to refund the money air asia had returned to me but mmt decided to cut off another inr 300 as their penalty charges. It made no sense since mmt already charged me inr 300 as their penalty fee. It was the first time our company trusted mmt with domestic flights. We will never book any flights for our employees again thrroigh mmt, since Mmt never decided to take this issue into consideration even after multiple attempts.they simply marked the case as solved and proceeded to close it after refunding what they thought was the refund I deserved. if there was a negative marking on the website, I would have given it as my rating. When we deal with fraudulant companies like mmt, it speaks bad not only of mmt but the employees as well.",1
1187,"Im giving this review based on my experience with this app , I used this app to book hotels for 3 times and every time I face a problem First I used this app to book hotel at rishikesh  , I saw pics of hotel on app and saw they refund  my money , if I cancel my booking due to some reason , but they did opposite , due to some reason I cancel my booking and wait for 2 days for refund , but they didnt refund it In my wallet . I call their costumer care , first the line shows busy and they said that due to other policies we are not able to make ur refund , I lost my trust from them and second time I book hotel for manali, it shows my booking was confirmed but at hotel I came to know that there is no booking for me , I again called their costumer service , they solved my problem this time and say sorry but whats the meaning of sorry if u already caused so much problem for me and 3 time I book a hotel in ambala and again there is a problem with that , overall horrible experience",2
1188,"I'm really very disappointed with the service that Makemytrip has provided. It was my first time booking with Mmt, and I'll not refer this to anyone. I booked a partially refundable flight which when I cancelled, got 0 refund. when I booked, at the time of making payment, thrice these people changed the flight fare, notification poped up that airline has changed the fare. I booked the same flight for previous fare from another app. reschedule charges were also too high. I booked two flights on different days at different time, but while both the times fare from airline has been increased, this is what they showed. So I checked on goibibo and the fare there was lesser. I checked on the spice jet app too. It was not increased anywhere else except for Mmt. So I booked the flight from there. But never again I'll use Mmt. These people are fooling the customers.",1
1189,At mmt the charges are much higher than what actually the prices and the ratings are of hotels. Worst services. They even have no refund or cancellation policies. I booked a hotel at mmt and paid almost ₹48000 but now the prices have flucuted to ₹22000 only. When we asked for cancellation they said it is not possible. If one can see there is huge difference in amount. So I suggest people not be fooled by making any bookings through mmt. They charges alot.,1
1190,MMT personals are not having the value of their words. I booked bus service through MMT app on 21/6/18 from Mumbai to Bangalore The vendor is failed to give satisfactory service. No proper bus ex Mumbai dropped at pune by another bus arranged bus for Banglore ex Pune but AC not working.vendor refused to arrange another bus same informed to MMT personals through customer care and email and ask for refund on 22/6/18  promised to solve the issue with in 7 days but issue is still pending(25 days has passed),1
1191,I have first bad experience from Makemytrip when I booked my trip to Maldives for 190000. Out of which they said 9000 will come to e-wallet and I was happy to hear.When I got 9k in my wallet the expiry of 9K is 6 months and in one booking u can redeem 500 bucks taht it.Nobody informed me this.Horrible customer service but then in India we dont have much options so I use makemytrip sometime when I see the flight fares are little less then other sites. I experience pathetic customer care response recently again hence I decided to rite a review.Try to avoid booking from makemytrip.,1
1192,"I and my husband booked a trip to Andaman, Havelock And Neil Islands in December 2016 through MakeMyTrip. We left from our home to catch the flights and suddenly we got a call from MMT staff that there are heavy rains in Andaman and therefore all flights have been canceled for the two days. We were sad to hear about the cancellation and we're also worried about the amount we have already paid to MMT. We dropped them a mail about the rescheduling if possible. We got a revert mail from their side and they gave us to pick any dates in one year time frame. So we picked dates in March 2017 for which booking was 6000/- Rs less than the prior amount and they did repaid that amount as well. The trip was arranged nicely. All the flights, hotels, foodings, tour guide were more than what we expected.",5

Also we booked our stay through MakeMyTrip at Hannover.(In the hope of a smooth business trip) Issue 1: Colossal stress and loss of valuable time and money due to false apartment contact details After reaching Hannover, we hired a cab for the address mentioned in the Booking Details(PFA 1). While reaching to Gottinger Chausee, we were just unable to find the ""3012"" apartment after an hour we were stupefied and astounded to know that there is NO APARTMENT with 3012!. After pulling ourselves together we decided to go back to railway station and ask someone for help. Over there, the DB Kiosk came to our rescue out of this mind numbing shock to us. They spent some time and finally found the actual name and number of the owner of the apartment. They called the owner and asked for the address and finally got the correct address. After 2 long hours of hassle we finally got the right contact details. So we hired another cab and eventually got to the apartment. It was a bit relaxing to see a beautiful and resourceful apartment, thanks to the helpful owner. Losses from this nightmarish experience: 2 hours of our valuable time Colossal stress Couldn't work for a minute the whole day One round trip plus extra driving at Gottinger Chausee in cab Issue 2: Colossal stress and extra charges wrongly applied due to faulty NO SHOW of flyers Our return tickets from Frankfurt to India were wrongly cancelled without informing us or even consulting the flight company Fly Emirates to know the reason of why we didn't board the flight.

The Fly Emirates person provided these details to give to MakeMyTrip for reopening the tickets, about which MMT people were not even aware or they were trying to hide it from us. After digesting the shock, we called MakeMyTrip. That imbecile, blunt, disrespectful and more importantly inexperienced person clearly denied us the possibility of reopening the tickets. That was another bombshell for us. At this stage we called Fly Emirates again and got on conference call with MakeMyTrip(MMT). We have got all the recordings as a proof of all this. At the end, The Fly Emirates representative had to explain MMT representative that how to reopen the suspended tickets. That bonehead didn't even know how to calculate the difference of charges(though wrongly applied). Because of all this, we weren't even served food during the flight adding to our plight.

Before 2 days of journey, the bus operator(kalamurthy travels) cancelled the journey and sent an sms regarding this. I complainted make my trip customer care for refund.

Till I didn't receive refund or any response from make my trip. Make my trip is the worst bus booking agency I have ever seen. Please don't go for this idiots for booking your bus tickets guys.

You expect all package to include airfare for international packages. In order to show package cost low, they exclude it so that you feel good about the package and you book it without knowing airfare is not included. Either you have to pay hefty airfare cost separately or cancel it. If you cancel it even next day after payment, you will lose 25% or more of the package cost. No possibility to switch to another packages to avoid any lose. They will still charge you for cancellation. Never ever buy vacation package and you will regret.",1
1201,Customer service is absent. I booked the ticket and airlines cancelled one leg of the ticket. Makemytrip till date did not help me get the refund. After speaking to the airlines I was informed that I am eligible for full refund. Makemytrip will not tell how much is the refund amount and when will it be processed. It is better to use a small city based travel agent then use make my trip.,1
1202,"MMT was a wonderful experience till a few years ago. I have been air travelling for past 30 years and have used MMT for past 10+ years. After initial hick ups it grew to a wonderful service providing reasonably good prices and customer friendly support service over phone. Over the years they became a very popular name and business increased manifold and their head turned by 180 degrees. Now there is no customer service over phone. Instead they flaunt a ""24x7 support"" feature under which the site force leads you to a bunch of anticipated(baseless) categories and under each category there are silly childish questions most of them all users already know the answers. Then it advices if your query is not here then contact 1800-102-8747. If you dial you find that they talk only to those who want to make a fresh booking for international or national holiday or those who have already booked a ticket. MMT fails to realise that many people might have problems while online booking regarding payment or regarding understanding the complex nature of terms of various airlines and the T&C of MMT itself! The it suggests for domestic booking go and book on website. How unjust!",2
1203,"I book hotel through make my trip.com app from my mobile phone for one night booking at PrimRose nanital for 3 rooms with children, we were 3 families. when we book hotel the pics seen by us was completely different what we seen in person. sooner we cancel rooms and since 13th night we are continuing calling make my trip to refund our money. I paid 15075.00 through my card and today is 15 june 2018, 10: 49 pm and they are with no intention to refund our money.only we are getting stories, execuses. is this the way they treat customer. when we see they site its mentioned Customer Care, is this the care MMT is doing by eating others money.I had made more then 20 calls and spiken to so many assistant, supervisior, senior supervisior but nothing in positive.while transfering call minimum waiting time is 15 minutes, max , no limit , then sooner they sorry for inconvenience. For transferring call they need 15 mins. they treat customer as beggar.so I will surely do more comments , complaints against make my trip that they eat money and cheat customerssacchin Annand",1
1204,The customer grievance handling procedure of MMT is pathetic. Bookings are made instantly but to lodge a complaint and get it redressed is a herculean task. I booked a hotel through MMT from 4th to 7th June at Dalhousie. The hotel and room was in a shabby state and also not in accordance with that shown in the MMT site hence we did not checked in. The MMT claims in their advertisement that the sum paid in advance for a hotel booking is refunded in case a customer does not like the property. In my case I lodged a complaint to MMT and demanded my money back. They are so reckless that they resorted to pay me a travel voucher of Rs 4500 as against my amount of Rs 16000 plus. Such an attitude of MMT is disgusting. May be the company is enjoying monopoly in this industry. A day would come when customers like me in large numbers would boycott them and move to other worthy options.,1

1207,"Day 1 – I was on call and finalized the package and also the flight leaving to our destination and reaching in the morning( the package was finalized, subject to changes which I did only to remove one city from the iternary) Day 2 Start of the Harassment SAGA Discussion on for changes of iternary to remove one city from the circuit(multiple quotes hence confused) and I wrote a mail asking if there what are the changes with what we discussed and also asked the same on phone.  The response in mail from the agent was no the “Package is a similar iternary” and on phone, I was informed only one Hotel was changed. I was on call and was told PAY IMMEDIATELY  for a ""Ready pay today only discount"", which was good.  I was holding the call and I paid the amount asked for and immediately received an SMS for from a different airline than the one I had selected.  Imagine my surprise / shock, somebody HAD CHANGED the flight without asking me(I had already booked connections based on original flight that was discussed and closed) Now starts the start of harassment – I immediately called back and asked why this was done(no answer).  Only that I need to pay for changes.  Logical assumption is while building package MMT would make more money if the flight was changed so they did WITHOUT INFORMING THE CUSTOMER. Day 3, 4 & 5 Day 6 THE Saga continues -  They said number my number not valid(I emailed my number again saying I am available on this number) – and yes received no call from anybody Day 7 THE Saga continues We called them again PLEADING FOR ATTENTION - for reflection of discount offered and change of flights. An agent said your ""pay now"" discount will be reflected and you will get  a mail(NO MAIL RECEIVED so not sure it is reflected). Again the agent said you will pay for cancellation etc. etc., we said IT IS FINE just put us in the flight we were earlier booked for. Finally we got the grace and somebody decided – let them not suffer - and sent a mail that said refund only 300 / person for the cancelled fligth and I need to pay 2626 for a new ticket(WITHOUT mentioning which flight they were changing to,  just the amount).  I responded within an hour stating the flight that I wanted to be on and “YES GO AHEAD” Day 8 THE Saga continues Imagine the SHOCK I get one more mail saying the flight charges are now 3875 and refund reduced from 300 to 273 – this after giving a go Ahead before So here we go again one more Call and then agent says please tell me your concern “I REPEATED THE WHOLE STORY AGAIN” and guess what! he says concerned person another agent is looking into it and he will call back.  I ask for a supervisor(kept on hold for a while) – I kept insisting for a supervisor and she comes onboard and says(you can guess now), shows some sympathies no decisions no apology and she says the concerned person is on a break and will call you. I sent a mail to the ops manager writing the whole story and I insist only speaking to him No ops manager but the concerned(MMT don’t really have any concern for customer?) person calls back and we ask why did you not go ahead with mail “YES GO AHEAD” and he says was busy couldn’t check mail yesterday and he checked today and there is a Fare increase.  Again I ask for the supervisor and he comes on board says he sympathises and offered to share some of the impact of fare increase(yes I had repeat my frustration all over again) and says he will discuss internally and come back. We all know flight charges change with time, but there is a clear acknowledgement that the agent did not see my mail for GO AHEAD. I get a mail with payment link - Surprise! it is not for airfare but for the whole package reflecting “no discounts reflected- not sure” “no cancellation refund reflected” no sharing of impact reflected but instead to pay the whole package balance, I wrote a mail asking these questions I got a new mail with new amount reflecting all the discounts but again nothing about the refund for cancellation flight – so again I wrote clarification asking for it. I got another mail saying pay full amount now or you lose the risk of losing the flight detailed booked and refunds we will handle later(again NO FLIGHT DETAILS WHICH FLIGHT IT IS) – so I paid the full amount hoping it is the right flight I get another mail saying payment received will be forward for booking(NO FLIGHT DETAILS which flight it will be). I finally get a mail another Surprise I got a screenshot of the booking and it is ""HANDLUGGAGE ONLY"".  I checked the fare in MMT that I had to pay and it was inclusive of checked in baggage.  More frustrations - one more call and waiting time again and I requested to be put through to the supervisor who assured it will be fine(while posting this I am still waiting for what the outcome will be) Questions to answer OR MMT can chose to ignore: 1) Why was the flight changed from morning to evening WITHOUT discussion? Shouldn’t MMT own this mistake and not ask for Customer to Pay? 2) Why there was no revert for change of booking the very day I complained  and waited for 5 days for flight fares to go up? Shouldn’t MMT own this mistake for delay and not make customer responsible to pay? 3) Why should the customer pay for lapses or oversight from MMT(did not check mail was busy was the Agents answer)? 4) Why should the customer keep repeating the Story in Frustration when there are mechanisms in place to see email trail and phone recordings? 5) How can a customer be asked to pay the full amount almost one month in advance when there one month time to pay the balance? Is this because I said I was willing to walk out and ready to lose the balance amount? 5) How does MMT address such grievances and frustrations? By adding more to their frustration? Conclusion: Money and profit are drivers for any organisation but organizations that have held Customers at the highest level automatically do make both!  Clearly that is not reflected in this case, as I was interested in experiencing a wonderful holiday and not spend 6 days worrying about one flight change, which ended up costing me more.  The organization achieved its objective – I have paid full money! I am left frustrated(my wife too as she had to call and chase sometimes) and wondering what other bad experiences I will have to go through during this holiday. There was contemplation to let go of partial amount and walk away no more holiday losing money paid in advance(quite substantial) and move on with life OR go through the pains of having to deal with painful customer service responses and delays(their only objective was to make sure I paid!). I made the mistake of choosing the latter and regret and so I am attempting to bring awareness to a wider audience including my circle of friends and relatives to avoid such hassles in the future.",1
1208,"Dear Friends, MakeMyTrip is one of the Indian Online Travel companies which offers cheapest travelling that includes flight tickets, hotel reservation, rail and bus tickets etc. I have been using this app for quite a very long time. Majorly I book hotels from this site. We get variety of offers as well options when we browse through this app. This app removes the hurdle of physically checking hotels after we land to our destination. We can now pre-book hotels check their reviews and confirm booking by paying online. I truly recommend people to get their pre booking from this app and save lots of money. Thanks",5
1209,"Funny enough MakeMyTrip doesn't have a review section. I recently booked a flight from Mumbai to Chennai. While booking on the app, I never got an option of choosing the ZEROcancellation and only got an option of selecting Travel Insurance, which I did. When I called up customer service, they're telling me that travel insurance doesn't cover cancellation or modification and that I had to choose ZEROcancellation. I informed them that I didn't get an option to do that. I asked the customer service executive to go on the app and look at it himself - he did, and he didn't mention that he could see it. In fact I was told that it's available on the website but not on the app and that only on some airlines is that option available. An hour ago I went back on the app and checked the same flights, and'magically' I was offered the option to select ZEROcancellation. There may be an issue with the app, but there is definitely an issue with how the customer service department works. I have not got clear information as to why the executive couldn't see the option before. I don't even know if what they were saying about how some flights have the option and some don't is true or not. There is clearly a disconnect as the employees themselves have no idea how the website/app works. I would have happily paid the charges if I knew this was my fault - the reason I am even going to social media and been on the call with them for 3 hours is because as a consumer it is our right to have the right information - and not merely excuses and textbook answers.",1

Unfortunately, we lost all the videos of our sea walk and scuba at one of the Islands, due to some technical problem of our phone.

1212,"After Booking Hotel VIVIR in delhi, MMT team called few days later and told rooms are not available in the hotel and asked for other option, I gave them Hotel Souhtern, Delhi. They sent me confirmation on 7th may for the checkin 27th to 30th may. We went to the hotel around 6pm on 27th may and the hotel management told us that they never confirmed the Booking. When I called the MMT, you wont believe the response they gave me, they told the person handling my booking is not available he will be back next day after 10 am and will call me. Since we were traveling with children and had to look after alternate accommodation I thought of handling this later. On 31st may I sent them mail asking for explanation regarding the their failure to secure the booking still now they have not responded to the mail or called me.",1
1213,"One thing  I strongly disliked about MAKEMYTRIP.COM is that extra charges are taken to book the seats. I mean seriously? Already I had to pay Rs. 15, 180 for a round trip form Ghy to Silchar and back . Then why did I need to pay so much to book my seats.Taking a minimal fee for that was acceptable but paying Rs. 800 to book two seats up and down the trips is not so ACCEPTABLE . I would suggest Makemytrip group to please lower down your amount and have mercy on people of middle class like us. Now you would say that then why dint you go to SpiceJet official website and book tickets. then my dear SpiceJet official website had some problems and the payment page was not opening for a long time so I decided to book tickets here in Makemytrip.com.I am sorry but it was a horrible experience for me, Makemytrip….I will try to avoid this website from next time if u do not tryto improve on this.

1215,"I booked 4 double rooms for 10 adults of my family in Hotel Amogha International, Chitradurga well in advance on 12th April 2018 for hotel reservation from 28th April 2018(Checkin 12PM onwards) to 29th April 2018(Check out 12PM) Booking is done with full payment of Rs. 3400/-(Rs. 3093/- from my SBI Credit Card and Rs. 397/- from my MakeMyTrip Wallet) and received the hotel reservation confirmation from MakeMyTrip( Reference: MakeMyTrip voucher which is attached herewith). Also MakeMyTrip voucher clearly mentioned that booking is confirmed and nothing needs to be paid at the Hotel 3.There is no instruction from MakeMyTrip mentioned in the voucher to contact the Hotel Amogha International personally by the customer to confirm the booking On 28th April 2018, when we contacted the hotel Amogha international around 11PM for knowing route/location of the hotel, we were informed by the hotel management that there is no booking by MakeMyTrip in Hotel Amogha International for us and they will not be able to allocate any room for us. They answered very arrogantly and they didn't want to hear anything from us. We immediately contacted MakeMyTrip customer support on the number 1800 102 8747 and detailed the situation about the denied checkin at hotel, MakeMyTrip told us they will connect to the concerned department and the phone call was put on hold for 15 mins at the first time and no response after that, hence we disconnected. We called again 2 times the customer support, connecting to the concerned department and put on hold without answering continued for the next times as well. After that we made 6 calls to the customer support, on seeing our numbers the calls were never picked up by the support team. We have call logs for our reference and will be able to provide call reports from our mobile service providers in case we will end up in any legal process in future So our family was stranded in an unknown place with Old age people, ladies, kids with no place to stay in the night of 28th April 2018, we searched atleast 4 to 5 hotels in Chitradurga for arranging alternate stay. But unfortunately we were told that no rooms were available on that day in other hotels as well. In the meantime, we were never contacted back by MakeMyTrip to support us in arranging alternate rooms in chitradurga and even they didn't bother about our family at all. Since we were neither able to get any support from MakeMyTrip nor we were able to find any rooms by ourselves, we decided to go back to Bangalore in the midnight. While coming back from Chitradurga to Bangalore, on the way we got a call from you after 4 hours(Parth.Parikh) from the number+91-79 4027 8751 saying that the booking is cancelled and MakeMyTrip will refund the full amount( Rs. 3097/- to SBI Credit Card and Rs. 397/- to MakeMyTrip wallet) and in addition as an compensation for the mess done by MakeMyTrip Rs.1500/- Future Travel voucher will be added to our account. I informed them  to send in a mail all these details as I am driving at the time.",1

1217,"This website is good for those people who dont vary the rate to other website and those people who believe very much on Tv add. At first I also believe that this website have been taking low price rate in all bus, hotel, airline etc. But when I start to compare the rate to the other site then I realise that this is not true. At many times mostly bus booking or airline booking I faces many problem. 1) The offer is not applicable 2) Bookings are many time automatically cancelled. etc. And another smally problem  on Hotel bookings are 1) Many times at the low price hotel have not wifi or ac but here mentioned that wifi are giver. 2) Many times pool are not in low budget hotel but here mentioned that pools are here. This all things are very ridiculous. In all this problem now I not book any this for this site. But one thing is This problems which I mentioned on the above are for low budget case.but when u make a 5 star or 3 star then this problem is not occur.

1218,In this tour of 6 days covering St Petersberg(SPB) and Moscow MMT just arranges one half day tour of 2 to 3 hrs in each of the city. Rest everything is optional for which you have to pay. The net stay is only 4.5 days( 2 days in SPB and 2.5 Days in Moscow) as against 6 days claimed by MMT. First day half day is lost in travel as you reach only by afternnon to SPB. Similarly you loose half day on the final day as you have to reach Airport. In bn half day goes in commuting from SPB to Moscow which I dont consider a loss because the Bullet train is a good experience. More time should be given to SPB as its a historical city. Moscow can be covered in a lesser time. In our case we further lost half a day in SPB because the train schedule was advanced in morning hours as against the given scheduLe of afternoon. So SPB visit was name sake. The tour guide was  professional but he cant help it as the very planning of the Trip is flawed and does not give value for money.,2

That is also, when my journey date was 10 days after the booking date, and cancellation of the ticket was done instantly just after booking the ticket. This is very disappointing.

1250,"Booked a flight for Dubai, MMT was running an offer of 1500 cashback on HDFC Cred824it card if the booking is made on a Thursday using code HDFCINT. I did the same, booking was for 14500 INR and expected cashback was 1500. Tickets were available @13500 on the official website but to save 500 INR I chose to book through MMT and that was my mistake to fall into their lure and cheat trap. After no cashback was Cred824ited, I mailed their customer care and they sent me a screenshot saying no code was applied from my end! The worse part is there is no proof to actually make my claim as they didn't mention anything about HDFCINT code in any of the bookings mail they generated, only proof was to take a screenshot of the booking page and who does that? We trust the company. Now I am aishwaryasingh23ing 14500 INR for a ticket which would have otherwise cost me 13500 if I booked through official website. Their customer service is even worse than the fraud they are doing, representatives are more interested in closing the tickets than understanding the problem. Why would I book by aishwaryasingh23ing 14500 on their website on a Thursday using a HDFC Cred824it card(I primarily use AMEX for all bookings) and not use the code? I am sure there are more cases like this where they claim it's your fault that you forgot to apply the code(I CLEARLY APPLIED THE CODE) and cash on your human aspect. Advice to all, best to book tickets from official website or other channels. If MMT is offering a deal that is too good to resist and you wish to try your luck, then make sure to have all the screenshots handy and not rely on their mails. In this case I am assuming they'll oblige if you have the required trails to prove you are correct and given the nature of their scamming strategy you could be in for even more surprises. Reading about all the scams I am confused should I celebrate that I mAnasultange to wake up with only 1500 loss or be resentful at clear lack of professionalism and daylight robbery by MMT. I have learnt my lesson, I wish my post shall enable others to learn from my mistake and save their money from falling into these fraudsters hands.",1
1251,Make my trip is recommended by my friend when I using first time I don't expect that much price and it is too low price other than other website or other places when I booked my hotel from MakeMyTrip I got many more then expect cashback and office I will travel Manali and hotel book the hotel and I will happy to using MakeMyTrip because it give me that offers and cashback so I loved it very much.,3
1252,"I went to goa for a week so my friend recommended this application called Make my trip for booking for stay and travel. I installed that app and started exploring it. I found many filters such as Area, check in date, as well purpose of travel. I got many options with star rating nd I booked according to my budget nd preferances. Also similarly I booked my flight tickets with very amazing discount as compared to other websites. It was soo easy for me to do bookings. also there was wallet in which I got bonus cash back through referring the application. overall I really enjoyed using this application.",3
1253,Made a booking for an international holiday with MMT and I had to remind them at each step. They put me through hell. MMT should not be an option for booking your holidays. Please spread the word around. The tickets did not arrive even after reminding them. It was sent only 2 days prior to take off. The hotel confirmation vouchers were also delayed.,1
1254,I am sending this mail with utmost disappointment . I had made a booking with makemytrip considering it to be one of the best travel portal but my experience has left me Completely disappointed. I made booking on 27th april for wayanad( booking ref NH2003678567692) for 28th april-30th april. We received a confirmation for booking from mmt for hotel and entire payment was made at the same time. We had reached half way and called the hotel to inform for check in when the hotel informed that no booking has been received from mmt and they had no rooms available. We had a child with us and standing in middle of the road with no clarity on what to be done. We called mmt atleast 10 times but no one gave a solution for it. For atleast 3 hours we were continously calling mmt executives and none of them resolved the matter. With no clarity we moved back to bangalore And repeatedly called MMt to give alternate hotel bookings in wayanad or coorg in similar starred hotel. We had planned our holiday and taken leaves from office for saturday and monday. If this is the way a well known company like MMT works then I genuinely have questions on credibility of the company. I am never going to use MMT for any service and advise all my peer group the same. This is worst experience And customer care was not even considerate to give us options. If this is the way you treat your customers then please close the company as custoner service is the key for any company.#makemytrip#uninstall#Rajesh magow#Mohit Gupta#Jaipal Deswal#Jasmeet singh,1
1255,Hey guys I installed this app on my device since I travel a lot and using this app I was able to save a lot of my money. Well it has almost been 3 months that I am using this app and so I must rate it 9 on 10 because of its features and its genuineness. It is really helpful for booking hotels and tickets for your flights. The main thing that it provides is the insane discounts on the booking of your tickets or the hotels. And its user interface is also decent so even a biginer and use this app with ease. So guys I must say this is the best app for your travel guide. I will definitely recommend it to all of you guys.

They really response so quick that your problems solved within 10 to 15 mins, seriously a really surprising thing. I have modified my date of stay and primary customer name within minutes over customer service center. Other than this , regular reminder of your trip and flight time and date take their services to a different level. I really enjoyed the stay and services by mmt. Thanks MMT.",4
1261,"I am really like this site because its simply easy to use, and the hotels under this sit is really awesome.

1262,Had a very bad experience through Make My trip . I had booked a trip to Srinagar and Gulmarg and had paid advance booking amount of 25 k. Due to the recent incidents and tense situation in Kashmir I wanted to change destination to Shimla .The MMT representative promised to do the needful but kept on delaying this change on the pretext of getting approval from her superiors.I had given notice well in advance and it was very much possible for MMT to do the changes. So I was surprised  to get a call from MMT denying the request and also that no refund of my deposit amount will be given.This happened after a delay of 10 days . The change was for a valid reason and I expected MMT to respond positively . This experience and loss of 25kmade me realize the make my trip does not care nor does it have any Emapthy  for its customers,1

Really disappointed and have uninstalled the app. Will never ever use it again and not will I recommened it to someone",1
1271,"Please be aware while booking the Domestic or International Flight tickets through Makemytrip.com. Instead I suggest to book directly from Airlines Website. At least during cancellation, you will be able to save 300 per person. Ideally when someone is paying convenience charge for booking, they shouldn't charge for cancellation charges. Even airlines doesn't charge for the same. I have paid almost 18% of ticket cost to makemytrip. If you have 1% doubt that ticket may have to cancel then please book it through Airlines not through Makemytrip. Read their terms and condition where carefully.",1

Although the difference was not that much but I got other facilities too.make my trip is really good but I have still not tried the helpline of this app. The service is really very good as whenever you are in an emergency or there is a problem in a hotel regarding anything you can just contact the help centre and they are always ready to help you.

1280,"Unfortunately, booked international flight tickets on MMT on 22nd of feb 2018. I am travelling to UK and USA. Using the PNR in eticket sent by MMT, I was able to check all my flights details on Virgin Atlantic(Flights also include Jet Airways and Delta Airways) Last connecting flight in my journey is on 27th July, starting from BOM 3:00am and reach HYD at 4:30am by Jet Airways. In the first week of April, when I was checking my PNR on airlines website, suddenly, I noticed problem with my last connecting flight. BOM-HYD flight starting at 3 am is simply rescheduled to 2:30pm without any reason. Almost 12 hours delay, and close to 15 hours gap between connecting flights. When I checked the same with Virgin Atlantic and Jet Airways, they simply ask me to contact MMT. When I called MMT, they say problem with Jet Airways and Virgin Atlantic. All this is going on since 2 weeks THIS IS RIDICULOUS. I also raised several complaints on MMT website and Called MMT customer support on daily basis. My journey starts on 24th April. All the agents like parrots say, our backend team is working on this issue, and we have sent an email to airlines. When I called Jet Airways and Virgin Atlantic, they simply ask MMT to call reservation desk and resolve it. MMT has a complete different story. And mockery on MMT online support. MMT has 4 levels of escalation when we raise any complain. Level 1 – 3days, Level2(We Care Team) – 2days, Level3(Priority Team) – 2daya and last Level4(MAnasultangement Team) – Gods Know how much time they take to resolve issue. NOW THE FUNNY PART,  I patiently waited till level 3 to complete, and was about to escalate to Level 4, Then, MMT support system automatically pulled this complain to level 1 instead of level 4(ha ha ha mockery) and Restarted the Escalation cycle ha ha ha Some more FUN, on 13th of April @3pm, MMT MAnasultangement team called up and assured me that they will resolve the issue immediately, I was happy that the issue will be resolved on that day……. It’s been 4 days and still no update what so ever  HA HA HA MOCKERY MMT mAnasultangement team, gave DIRECT Mobile number and asked me to contact if my ticket related issues are not resolved. He sounded as if problem will be solved in next 5 mins. THIS MAnasultanGEMENT TEAM GUY DOSENT EVEN PICK MY CALL OR HAVE MINIMUM COURTESY TO CALL BACK SINCERE REQUEST TO ALL THE PEOPLE READING THIS….JUST TO SAVE SOME MONEY DO NOT BOOK ON MMT. BELIEVE ME YOU HAVE TO FACE ALL THE UGLY MUSIC. BANG YOUR HEAD AGAINST WALL ON DAILY BASIS….I DON’T KNOW HOW MUCH TIME MMT WILL TAKE TO RESOLVE THIS SMALL ISSUE GO AND BUY TICKETS ON AIRLINES SITE, NOT ON MMT. LIFE WILL BE SIMPLE THAT WAY.",1

1284,"Hi All, Today I am writing this review after a loss of around 28k on flight booking made on MMT. I booked return air tickets of my mom-dad for Delhi to Canada Let me give a detailed story. Before making a booking I called customer support of MMT and asked for a air tickets which may be cheaper since my dates were flexible. However, after some 5-7 mins. Executive informed my that there is no cheaper tickets then 1.49 lacs even if you changed the dates. Believing him, I went ahead and booked the tickets. To my surprise, my sister shared few cheaper air tickets of the same flight by around  6-7k with some other sites. I was left in a shock by knowing that there were alot of cheap and better air tickets with other sites by around 28k. When I contacted MMT again, they asked me to send an email to best price guarantee within 24 hrs which I send without wasting any moment further on 6th Apr18. However, even after following up with them number of times. I got a call from them on 10th but they said, we cannot help you as even though you raised the query on time. Our technical team did not forward to us. Therefore, we cannot do anything. I asked them cancel my air tickets and refund full. I will book again. But executive banged the phone by saying ""whatever"" and he misbehaved. This is really cheating and wrong/ false advertisement by MMT that in case you find cheaper fare we will return the difference amount. I am not asking for 28k which I lost due to executive but atleast refund 7k which is absolutely a demand which is according to there policy. Guys, I will request everyone. Please stop doing bookings on MMT and do not believe them blindly. They are crooks.",1
1285,"MakeMyTrip.com is an online website where we can get hotel bookings from home and also flight tickets for our vacation trip. Now I'm gonna tell my true experience with MakeMyTrip.com in which I faced much hassle. Firstly, when I made a hotel booking and got a confirmation that I've booked lodging in Alor Grande Resort in Goa for 4 days and 3 nights on 21st August, 2017. When I went there, the manager told me that there were no bookings taken on that particular date and I was much disappointed by this. Secondly, I faced many problems regarding flight ticket bookings. Transactions fail quite a lot. So, I felt that there is much hassle in using this website. Charges taken are much more than other websites also. I recommend not to use this website. Thank you.",1

IN FACT  WE HAVE ONLY AVAILED YOUR SERVICES only once, before.and We seriously did not know, otherwise, we could have booked it online through card.Then he tells his system is not showing the required ticket we wanted to book and explained it to us in a condescending and patronising manner, about  booking ticket .He asked  us to come the next day after calling him. I kept quite because as a senior citizen I wanted to book my ticket .The  NEXT DAY ON CALL, HE SAID the same excuse, AND RATHER asked  my daughter to send the screenshot of your website page and her whatsapp.THIS IS INDECENT AND TOTALLY UNPROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOUR of your staff to a customer. MMT you have rather lost a potential customer, forever, and I got my ticket booked through airport. Hope many people read this, and don't think MMT is the only source for tickets. I wonder what sort of service you might be providing for hotels.HOPE MANY PEOPLE READ THIS.",1

In unknown country we faced huge problem. Please don't book holiday package through makemytrip,1
1291,I booked a cab for nainital from delhi and as their policy we can only book before 2hrs. So we waited and after 3hrs I called them. They said that we're sorry just wait for 15mins driver will reach to you. Another 1hr passed and we called them again. This time they said that we cant send the driver to you due to some internal problem. I said that I have the driver details then whats the problem. They again said that we're sorry for the trouble. I was assured that the amount which was deducted from my account will be credited in 3 days but it cane after a week. Overall bad experience Very poor services,1

1293,Recently I have travelled to Malaysia and I have done my booking through make my trip and I loved the service provided by them. A full itinerary was provided by team and we enjoyed a lot. Everything was in a systematic manner and the service provided by them was too good. Now I am a regular user of make my trip. Com,5
1294,I've traveled to Bangkok with my friends with MMT 5days package. Everything was well explained before the trip and on trip all the guides and drivers are so good. All the drivers are punctual and the trip was fully fun ride! I strongly recommend this service for new travelers who planned for foreign trips:),5
1295,It was one the wonderful stay we had with family after so long. The Hotel is maintained nicely and service is awesome. Staff is very helpful & courteous. Executive class rooms are spacious. Royal Suite rooms & Club rooms are temple view rooms. You can see Dwarikadhish temple and sea from the rooms. Prasad the multicuise restaurant has lot of vartiety and taste is just amazing. If its a weekend than you may find waiting as well.,5
1296,Worst experience with MMT for these reasons - 1. the website with domestic hotel availability and price rates search page are really misleading 2. the invoicing page with additional costs added up are misleading 3. worst customer care to support. my experience was that they have inflated the cost beyond the maximum rates charged by hotels.,1
1297,"I booked a business room in a hotel in hyderabad from MMT which has accomodation for 2 adults by default in all websites like goibibo and yatra but only MMT has this hidden thing of only 1 adult for a business room. This was the first time I booked hotel from MMT because of attractive prices but after booking I got to know that the same hotel room has only one person accomodation only in MMT. When I called mmt people, they said that they will talk to the hotel but in the end they said you have to pay whatever the hotel is saying which was again 2 times more just for a single person. Bad attitude, good for nothing, cheaters, play hidden tricks to attract clients. Please go for goibibo or any other website else check each and every clause very carefully in MMT.",1
1298,Most of the time I booked flights and hotels thru MMT and I really enjoyed the service provided by them. This time I really frustrated with the service provided by them. I went to shirdi and mumbai with my family and I booked flights as well as hotel in mumbai using make my trip. The room booked in hotel emerald inn using make my trip is really a big mistake by me. In the frontnof the hotel hen wholesaller shops is present and at the backside of the hotel there is a flowing runnel having a pungent smell across hotel. The complimentary breakfast provided by them is very bad. I completely lost my trust from maje my b trip after this incidence.,1
1299,"It was a terrible experience in this stay. The booking was made for 3 persons(2 Adult+1Child) but on reaching the hotel, we were told that MMT had given them booking of only 2 people. We were allotted a small bed instead of twin bed as per booking. We asked for an additional bed or mattress for which we were asked to pay Rs.1000+taxes per night. We had to finally argue with the hotel staff. The story doesnt end here. Everything provided was considering only 2 people viz; basic things like water, towel, toiletries, etc.We raised an issue with regards to this at the hotel wherein we were informed that IBIS doesnt have a family room & that they never take accommodation for 3 people. To make the things worst, TV was not working for the entire day of 27th Nov, 2020.After a lot of follow ups finally the TV issue was set right only at 10pm in the night. We were just fed up in the room.  To make the things worst we tried to make a complain with MMT but there is no clear provision for raising a complain & finally when we reached the complain link, the site expressed inability of taking complain citing COVID reasons & asked us to call on some 0124. landline number which never connected. It seems MMT has clearly misguided us in the booking. We seek refund for the amount paid as the stay was totally unsatisfactory.",1
1300,"I had the worst experience booking the makemytrip cab service. I do not get it how these people even run their business. I booked a cab from Pune to Mumbai as I had a flight booked from Mumbai. The cab driver who came to pick me up was not the one that I received the details for. After sitting in the cab, the driver asked me for Rs 2000 cash payment. When I told him that the payment had been made in advance online, he would not start the cab. He called his vendor, and started asking for money. This whole process took some 20 minutes. My trip was supposed to start at around 6.30 am but started at 6.50 am. The driver was driving the vehicle very slowly and continuously was on phone and kept on saying that he had been fooled and that I should be the one who should pay him. After some time he received payment of Rs 1000 from the person who gave him this ride. I had been trying to call the makemytrip customer care. At this point he stopped the cab and was not moving further. He said that he would not move further until and unless, he received the full payment. After calling the makemytrip customer care, they said that they would look into the matter and so asked me to stay on hold for some time. I was on hold for about 5-10 minutes and had no response from the customer care.  Somehow, I managed the driver to move the cab and get started on the road. The driver kept on asking me for money and kept on saying that he had been fooled and that if I didn’t compensate him by paying him the remaining Rs 1000 he would not move ahead and even asked me to look for some other cab and leave his cab. He even kept on saying that as now it so late, he was not sure if I could make it in time to Mumbai airport to board my flight. At the toll, the driver said he did not have money and so I would have to pay the money. Again at this point the driver stopped the cab. This time, the person from whom the driver got this ride called me. He said that he would Paytm me Rs 1000 and asked me to use this money to pay the toll and return him back the remaining amount. I paid the toll at two places. It was about 7.45 am when we crossed the toll. The whole ride the driver kept on asking me for remaining Rs1000. In the meantime, the vendor who gave the driver this ride called me and asked me to not pay this driver anything and just leave once I reach the airport stating that “he wants to teach this driver lesson”. Once, I reached the airport I told the driver that I would pay him Rs 735 as I Paid Rs 265 for toll.(Rs 230 for the expressway toll and second toll of Rs 35) The driver disagreed and stated that the vendor from whom he got the ride promised him that he would get Rs 2000 in cash and that the customer riding would have to pay the toll. He said that until I would not give him the remaining Rs 1000, he would not let me take my luggage. Later, I asked him to talk to his vendor and made a payment of Rs 700 and left. The main reason of writing this whole incident is that, I feel that makemytrip really does not take their customers’ safety seriously. I was alone girl travelling and whenever on the highway, the driver stopped the cab and said that he would not take the cab further until he got his money was very traumatizing. I was so stressed that if I could make it in time for my flight. I really do not understand the whole point of sending the cab driver details if the same driver won’t be coming to pick up the customer. The next point is we as customers get so helpless in these situations and do not even understand what to do next in such cases. As the driver said, even he was fooled my makemytrip. I had hoped for a peaceful ride to the airport so I opted to travel by cab rather than a train or bus. At one point when the driver stopped and started claiming that he would not move ahead I just thought that I would miss my flight. Thank God, at least I could manage making it on time on the airport. There are so many things that could have gone wrong in this trip. The main and most important concern that I have is of the customers’ safety, neither MMT nor the vendor had the drivers’ details or his cab number. The vendor asked me note down the cab number once we got down and send it to him so that he could look into the matter. I mean really, here a customers’ safety was at stake and the vendor had his own vendetta of teaching this driver a lesson. When I got to know from the driver that he came to know about this ride on some “Whatsapp driver group”. He said he got a message on this group about the ride and that he would be paid rs 2000 cash and the toll would be paid by the passenger. This makes me really wonder that how can MMT call itself “India’s No 1 Travel Company”. The way the driver got information about me travelling from Pune to Mumbai, is so unsafe. As nobody had the driver details, it would have been so difficult even to track down the car, if anything would have gone wrong. The vendor who gave the driver this ride, himself didn’t even have the car number. I would really suggest the people, to not opt for MMT cab services. I would suggest that they either travel via bus or train. It was the worst trip ever. As for MMT, please take customer safety seriously and also please select yours vendors wisely, and rather than just trying to provide your customers with services try providing them a good experience or else no one will pay extra just for the services as there are other modes which are cheaper and definitely more reliable.",1
1301,"I booked a holiday package to singapore and malaysia through make my trip and payed an initial amount of Rs 42000. I could not travel as my wife fell ill and doctor advised not to make any travels. Make my trip gave me 2 options. One submit medical documents related to illness and medical certificate and they will give maximum refund. Second one was reschedule the travel in which case the date change penalty would need to be bourne by us. Since I was unsure of my wife's health progress, I decided to cancel the booking and submitted all the documents as requested from Make My Trip. For 2 months they didnt even look at the reports and just kept prolonging the case. Once I started making serious follow ups, the management looked into the matter and within 2 days they responded saying no refund is possible as cancellation was done 14 days prior to the trip. They are saying 64K is the cancellation cost and 22k cancellation charges has been payed by make my trip to the airline and hotel people. Is it really believable? They already have seats and rooms blocked in the name of Make My trip and if a person A doesnt show up, they make up for it by allocating it to another person B.Make my trip uses these kind of refund opportunities to make free profit when a big amount is involved. I have now given away 42K to make my trip for nothing. I used to be a loyal customer to Make My Trip but I am never going back there again as I have now realized. THEY ARE CHEATERS!",1
1302,"On 5th of March I booked two flight tickets for my sudden plan on the same day. I selected Indigo airlines which was scheduled 2 hours from the time I booked the tickets. Everything seemed fine. The calendar said 5th of March. And I was taken to a aishwaryasingh23ment gateway, I made the aishwaryasingh23ment. And then BOOM I was given a ticket for 6th of March. I called the customer service for a refund. But the B@$T@rD on the other side was rude, inconsiderate sounded defensive and the main criteria of this website looked like they were there only to make money. He said he will check the logs and come back to me. HE came back on the line after 10 mins and said the logs are not available. I had to leave, I called my travel agent who booked my tickets for Jet Airways. Meanwhile I got an email from Make MyTrip promising to resolve the issue or refund 100/- to 1000/- for every hour they delay.  44 Hours 29 mins and gave me 1000/- in my MakeMyTrip wallet. These guys are ruthless, inglorious bunch of A$#oles. I suggest stay clear off MakeMyTrip they are not worth it. The Indigo Airlines staff told me I'm not the first person reporting this. They have had so many issues. And they hate MakeMyTrip. MakeMyTrip had actually charged me Rs.500/- more for the same ticket I checked at the Indigo Counter.",1
1303,"MMT is Simply awesome!. I had stay on 3 & 4 March 2018 at hotel Ekdant in Ganpatipule, Maharashtra. I had bad experience of hotel facilities and hospitality. Poor services, failure of multiple amenities at  same time which were committed etc. but I am very much impressed, pleased and obliged with the services of makemytrip(mmt). They listened to my complaint and within few mins solved my issue. In fact refunded me my hotel booking amount within 15 mins of my complaint during feedback. MMT taken hotel management to task by having conference call extension to my same feedback call and hold hotel mgmt accountable, subsequently refunded booking amount within no time. I don't think any other online services travel agency like mmt which not only responds to customer request/complaint but resolves it quickly to full customer satisfaction. Thank you very much MakeMyTrip.",4
1304,Worst experience with Make my trip can services. The driver details was shared 2 hours before my scheduled pickup and the driver was not responding to my calls.1 hour after my scheduled pickup MMT informed that my can stands cancelled and the money will be refunded.

I am really disappointed that I have booked a Cab for Pickup at 1:00 PM from Bareilly to Airport and the cab reached at 3:00PM, my Flight could be missed, my complete Journey can be ruined because of makemytrip. Later, Driver on end movement denied duty and refused to travel to Airport. Really unfortunate! I have book cab, 1 month ago with complete payment in advance so that I didn't face any trouble.

Why should I pay for the mistake? why are they extorting my hard eaarned money? Firstly MMT is forcing an Indian to visit a Political Unrest Country Secondly even after knowing I agreed to pay cancealltion fees now they are denying me my hard earned money Thirdly this fraud of showing something and giving something needs to be stopped",1
1311,"Hi, very good experience  the air ticket booking from make my trip . The first reason is my first booking 2011 when am first vacation from Dubai to Cochin, I checked the price and compare to Cochin travelers and other online sites. more than 120/100 AED difference. The second Reason is the user friendly web site and any normal man can know about the details for any air ticket. as a friend as a adviser . check the website - can see filtering felicity available separate details of luggage time description and every thing as a user friendly website totally I never see same like this site for air ticket booking yet conform I suggest every people to best site for air ticket booking from U.A.E -KERALA Note: I see one major complaint is web site loading time too long and if change the date to check price that time is too long for loading, that only my experience I dont know other will be same",5
1312,"On 16th november last year I booked two ticket via make my trip application. It was quite fast and easy to booked on. As I booked the tickets one or two days before. They gives a sketch of the bus featuring the seats. The darken seats reserved from before and unreserved are without darken. From the first visit to the app I managed to booked two tickets easily, and paid via pay tm app. The paying feature is quite efficient and reliable. On the due date we took the bus from the booked bus stop and the conductor took us to our respective seats. As it was a government OSRTC bus, the bus was well maintained and cleaned. The conductor asked, your ticket os from online! no! I told yes. After that mini conversation he won’t came another time there by we felt some relaxation as I expected some serious inter questions between me and the conductor because it was my first make my trip journey. I had never booked a bus ticket from online websites before. So I was pretty nervous too. The journey was great. Everything went good. When it comes to the price concern, I got some discount and the price minimised which is good for every common people. And I subjected to the make my trip cash which I can not used from my make my trip wallet because that was not appropriate to this tickets, rather loging into a make my trip account gives 2000 make my trip cash. Any way it all went good. On the next day make my trip mailed me about their feedback and I think they were quite active and genuinely providing good service. This review is from a single debut journey, I do not know about the rest. This review included the below screenshot.",3
1313,"Hello everyone welcome to my page again in this review of mine I will disclose a big fraud of our ticket a booking website MMT. Just few days back I was roaming on mmt just checking flight price. I was not on the way of booking tickets what happened is my internet just slowed down so I refreshed my page what I see is that the price went up it went about 750rs more so I thought it would be a glitch so I again opened in new tab it shower same result. Again for assumption I checked it  but same.so I asked one of my friend to chtit and his price was different as he didn't surf his prices did not rise up. What mmt did is they asorted a compilation that anyone who would stick to their server checking up tickets to book the price of the same tickets would go up for him only. For ex: if I would surfing and checking for a cheaper ticket, the more the ticket prices would be going up. This is a monopoly thay have created so they can get better rates fort their tickets. Do you all as consumers think that it is legit to do this as no one would be buying a high price ticket So plz share ur opinions on the comment section and raise up voice by giving reviews Thanks yoy Follow me as you will get my review first",1

They provide detail information about the hotels, bus, train, air ticket and all it will be more helpful to search in a single website. It does not take much time to load any have we will get quick action regarding booking and all within 1 hour of conformation. Hope my review helpful to you thanks.!",5
1317,Worst service. they make money by just booking hotels. No assurance in case of any issue. Customer support is also worst. Sad but true. I had booked a room for 3 adults in MakeMyTrip. Got a room for 2 adults with extra mattress in the small room near bathroom. Don't trust make my trip. MakeMyTrip assured doesn't mean aanything. You can't trust them for anything. This is just a app to book hotels nothing more.,1
1318,Customer care support become help less at the time of Refund. Never do booking via MMT because if it got cancelled they will not refund you in time even after so many months. Very bad services I must say. we have booked a trip for Bali in September 2017 for November 2017 but unfortunately it got cancelled because of Volcano now we are not getting the refund but they still use to say that you will get it after 24-48 hours from past 2 months now. I have complaint in Consumer court but still the issue is same.,1
1319,"Especially if you're a woman and you want to travel safely in India, switch to Cleatrip. I requested a cab service from Madikeri to Bangalore through MMT. I'm a single woman. After confirming the cab with me, the driver decided just not to show up. Not only was I stranded in the middle of nowhere but I had to pay through my nose to find an immediate alternative cab service that would get me back to Bangalore. And guess what - neither the cab driver nor MMT were concerned about me! They did a partial refund of my trip, which was pretty much nothing compared to what I had to pay. If you're a woman, don't take traveling in India lightly - do it properly. Make most of your bookings through Cleartrip, which is way more reliable and customer-oriented.",1
1320,"Iwas trying to book a trip to visit religious sites all over india for travel in February 2018 using Makemytrip's website. It appears there website only works if you have an indian cell phone number. I booked a tour through their website and eas given a quote for a two night trip from Indore to Ujjain and back tp Indore  with specific hotels and car. Ipaid the whole amount as adked to do. After that I was told that they can only book one night and two day trip through their tour department and I should book tha second night myself. It took about 50 odd calls from Toronto where I live to their reperentative in Ahemdabad who wS handling my file to get the remaing money Rs 2000 back which was already transferred to their bank account. It took about 3 to 4 weeks to figure out how to get the money back. Ultimately I got fed up and suggested they book another flight for me for Rs1776. Thats it that is what I got back. They to this date has never mentioned tbe difference. It is a small amount but I find it unethical for a travel company to not fully account for the money received by them on a quote presented bu them.  Do not fall for their to report a problem because they do npt listen to what you say they just keep sending you email say ""is it resolved to your satisfaction"". Once you say no then nothing happens. I think they should say clearly on there website that you only use there services if you have an Indian Cell number for review. I even wrote to there management who passed on my complaint to the same person who created all this mess. Now I hear is that person has gone on long term leave but no resolution to my loss. So be carefull before you give them your money.",1

1328,"I have planned multiple trips for my family with the help of MakeMyTrip.com. This has really helped me out to plan our holidays to beautiful yet unknown locations. Finding hotels, transportation and charting out a wonderful itenary is always a difficult task when we plan our vacation. But with the help of MakeMyTrip its quite simple. We could choose from a wide range of options and chart things according to our budget and choice. Last year we went on a tour to Rajasthan. We landed at Jaipur where we were received by a nice gentleman who represented MakeMyTrip. He was a wonderful travel guide and a good driver too. We had hired a car and traveled to various places in that car with him. We went to Udaipur, Chittor, Mount Abu and all with him. He was very keen in introducing new things and specialities of each place we visited. He knew authentic restaurants and great shopping destinations too. This really helped us we might not have discovered these places without him. He was extremely polite and well behaved. Since we had a car hired through MakeMyTrip our journey was quite comfortable and hassle free. They try to cover all places as per the itenary offered to us and also at a cheap rate. They provide us a lot of flexibility in terms of hotel bookings/ cancellations too. We can make cancellations of hotel even after we start our journey if we like to change our plans or decide the stay somewhere else. We reached a destination early before the said hotel check in time. So the hotel denied us the room. But when we complained at the customer care the officials took care of this issue. They spoke with the hotel and arranged the rooms. Thus I am very happy with their services and it is very easy to book it from the website or mobile apps. Thanks for making our holidays so special and hassle free.",4
1329,"Beware of hotel bookings that you do through MMT. The confirmation mail / SMS from MMT reassuringly states that you need NOT call up the hotel to re-confirm the booking. But that is exactly what should be done! I booked 2 hotels through MMT for a family trip to Andaman during the last week of Dec, 2017. 2 hotels because I was going off Port Blair for a couple of days in between and being high season, I could not get the same hotel for the next few days I wanted. The first hotel reservation turned out to be fine. But when I called up the second hotel, to ask for a taxi pick-up, to my surprise, they said that there is no booking in my name!. I forwarded the SMS from MMT to them. They checked and told me that MMT had tried the booking, but since they were sold out, they never accepted the booking from MMT. I was hearing this less than 24 hrs before … and imagine the situation … peak season in Andaman, with a family and nowhere to stay for the last 2 days in Andaman. I got in touch with MMT customer care somehow and what was their solution after trying to convince the hotel(and failing)? They just called & told me that they would refund the booking amount to me and “Sir, once you get back to Port Blair, please get into any hotel. We will reimburse the difference up to X amount”. As if getting a hotel in peak season in Port Blair, is child’s play, and their responsibility is just limited to reimbursement by a higher amount and washing their hands off the goof-up. . Fortunately for me, I was able to get the same hotel where I stayed during the first few days. The owner was kind enough to make some arrangements for me & my family. All in all, I would say that MMT is really poor in serving it’s customers because it failed to simply inform me in advance(i.e. well before I started for Andaman) that my booking isn’t there. Had I not called the hotel 24 hrs before and discovered this issue by chance, I would actually have landed at their reception and then faced this. But the reservation for the first hotel was fine, which was also through MMT. What trust does such a company deserve where one booking is good and another is not? And you never know where they failed, unless you are extra-cautious and call up each and every booked hotel and make sure. And when they fail, the customer is left to fend for themselves. In case MMT folks are reading through this, the booking ID in context of the experience above is NH2123170694151.",1
1330,"Hey friends I am sharing my personal  knowledge of makemytrip.com I had been reserving a hotel in Lucknow Named manohar palace from this site. I booked deluxe room in that hotel,  It was good stay, facilities were also good, I got most of the facilities at an affordable price. Food was also delicious. You can go anyplace from that point. Lodging room was spotless and benefit was alright as well, general my stay was decent. My general experience was extraordinary and inn which I had booked were great.",3
1331,"I have been cheated with makemy trip , while booking I have a seen one cancellation charges for my flight , after making the payment tickets delivered to my Inbox and i am seeing that different cancellation changes which is more than the tickets cost , when i raise a case with Makemytrip , they said it is ""due technical issue and kindly ignore it "" looks like while booking the ticket they are showing different numbers and after the payment once the tickets is delivered then you can see different charges, so I have decided NOT to use makemytrip going forward, Friends , please be careful , while booking the tickets please take a screen shot all the prices and book the tickets, because once the ticket is delivered then you can see different charges Regards Srikanth",1
1332,"Nice homestay value for money. Great Ambience good for family especially with kids. About the ambience - its situated near a canal with a small vallom parked by Plenty of space and facilities for kids to run around. Rooms are all neat and clean. Food served is home made and great - Enjoy Kerala appam, kadala curry, Omelette etc Lakefront is just 5 minutes walk where you can enjoy sunset. There is a beautiful church located right opposite. Cheapest option to enjoy the beauty of the backwaters is to take the govt operated boat service used by commuters from kumarakom boat jetty to muhamma and back. Trip one way is around an hour and return fare is just 20. the trip is very good and right thru the backwaters. Boat is not at all crowded Go To kumarakom bird sanctuary morning 630am if you fancy a walk thru the forest and if you are lucky spot some birds. If you have a car, you can go to a decent and quite waterfall - aruivikuzhy falls- about 40km. On the whole a great experience and would recommend to budget conscious travellers. There are obviously high end resorts and houseboats and all. But if you are looking to experience Kerala food and culture at a decent budget, this is the place to be. Having transport will definitely help. Auto stands are right opposite and could spot a few private buses operating as well.",4

1339,"I am going to write my review about MakeMyTrip.com We were planning for a trip to Mysore and decided to plan our trip through Make My Trip.com. The Portal is tremendously good.  It gives comparison of several trains and several airlines and also offers the cheap fare.  This Portal also offers accommodation facilities at different locations of our choice. The Service and Support of this Portal is worth mentioning.  In case of refund, money is transferred as fast as possible. This Portal offers information in depth so as to anyone to look for the entire details. The content on this Port offers very good information, the only irritating thing is the pop up advertisements which pops up on and often to make one irritating. The site is user friendly since it gives all sorts of information required. The server on which the portal deployed is a very fast one leaving no complaints to either load or refresh. I recommend for everyone who plans a trip to use Make My Trip and get benefit of cheap fares. Wish you all the best Make My Trip.",5
1340,I booked a cab service for Pune to shridi round trip from MakeMyTrip. On the site they took booking for swift desire Toyota Etios or similar. And they sent me a indigo which was not at all comfortable. Firstly when I did the booking the details were not available on the app or MakeMyTrip website. No facility to change the pick up timing. After 100s of calls to the customer care they sent me Payment link on the last day to do payment. 700rs was the minimum amount to be paid I paid RS 3000 as I thought anyways I should pay at the end of the trip. But it was my biggest mistake. After fighting for 1 hr over the helpline they were not even ready to refund the difference of 2300rs which I paid over the booking charges. This is insanely worst service ever. Ended up wasting 3000rs and booking an another can for the trip. DONT EVER USE MAKEMYTRIP. CHEATERS hope u go under loss and shut down.,1

When I mentioned that the number was mentioned, was in the ticket, which was closed and customer service of Machimetri was saying that we can not do anything yet, can alternatively take it. According to the client's executive, they can only complain about this issue. I could not catch my bus due to this reason and needed a big ticket ticket and the required reservation for the ticket, which was Rs 850 and Rs 1100. Now I am cheating myself and want compensation for my loss. This is a benign request for all travelers, please do not use MakeMyTripCom, these people are fooling their customers and nothing else.",1
1342,"When I arrived at the Sumitra Hotel I asked for 300. I have to make MakeMyTrip but deny that the call was called before I told MMT about someone else and they said they only need the original file and not another person. But pay 300 banks in front of the hotel to decide to make a MakeMyTrip operation and you can not tell whether it's 300 or 3000 to view or place on your website. My problem was not there when I looked through the 17th day of the 12th Tribunal, they asked for more than 300 other books. The hotel manager / landlord was Sardar ( could not speak in his name) and nobody was told - said, Let's say you're over 300 in one night  if only 300 of the check-in time - intelligent. In all respects, I want to restrict all the United States and the Sumitra Hotel for their injustice, labor failure and technical work. I also mentioned the representatives of Alie Bhatta and Ranveer Singh who helped her to inform her - I believe you will not be well off if people get money from your name. People of all people are watching and admiring you, but you will see what you were. We contacted and printed MakeMyTrip / on-call reservations for recommendations from TSIS to get more information on how guests can book their online rates.

1346,I came to know about make my trip from advertisements on the internet. So I thought to use it. I had to travel to Mumbai. So I booked a hotel from make my trip. There very not many options for me but still I chose an hotel. But due to some reasons my trip was cancelled so it was obvious that I cancel my booking. I opened the site but it took me too long to cancel the booking. It is not very user friendly. I was facing problems in cancellation. The refund of my money also took too long. Make my trip did not send the request for refunding my money to the bank. I was annoyed. I also tried to call the customer service but did not get any satisfactory solution. The staff behaves improperly. They kept my call on hold for very long. It took 3 weeks to get my refund. In that also they only returned 50% of the total amount. I will never recommend this site to anyone.,2

1350,"In Oct 2017 I booked hotel Menino in Goa through MakeMyTrip.com from 27th Dec 2017 till 1st Jan 2018. Later, on 23rd Dec 2017 due to medical emergency I had to cancel my plan so I requested MMT to cancel my hotel booking. They asked me to submit the proofs for the medical emergency. After reviewing the proofs they approved the hotel cancellation with full refund and I received a confirmation for the same by mail as well as SMS on 25th Dec 2017 saying my refund will be processed within 2 working days but till date even after communicating the issue several times no refund has been made. It's a pity that a company such as MMT can fail so badly to keep it's commitment to their customer. Here is the detailed story: > On Oct 21, 2017 I booked hotel Menino in Goa to celebrate new year in Goa with the family. > In Dec end we were all excited about the trip when we first found out about some serious medical issue with my kidney. On Dec 23, 2017 doctor told me that I must cancel the trip and get admitted for the kidney biopsy. It was very heart breaking news to us. > With heavy heart I called MMT customer care and requested to cancel my booking. The MMT representative told me that my hotel booking is non refundable but considering medical emergency he will talk to the hotel and will try get the refund. I was bit happy about the effort MMT was making to get the refund in this hard time of mine. > Later on 25 Dec 2017 I received a mail from MMT asking me to submit proofs regarding the medical emergency. I replied them with all the available documents. > Within half an hour I got a call from MMT asking me to mail an id proof as well and they assured me that full refund will be made. Later I received a mail and SMS confirming the same. I was told within 2 days my refund will processed. I was happy to see the mail. > When, I did not receive any refund from MMT even after 5 days I called them. They told me in another 3-4 days refund will be initiated. > I waited for another 3-4 days but no refund was made. Then I called them again. To my surprise, this time customer representative told me that the booking is non-refundable. I told her that the refund has already been approved and I have received the mail and SMS for the same. After that she looked further and told me that she could also see the mail. She said she will check with person/team involved and get back to me. But she did not call back. > Later, one day, at night 11:10PM I received a call on asking me unnecessary questions regarding the cancellation. He also told me that my booking is non-refundable and he is still talking to hotel management. He said that he will TRY to get the refund. I was really angry to hear that. I told him that I have already received a confirmation regarding the full refund and there is not point of telling me that your are still trying. > After that again and again I tried to resolve the issue by calling/mailing the MMT but they just did not seem to care. They kept on forwarding my call one another. > In the end I wrote a mail to the management on 9 Jan 2017. I got an automated reply that my concern will be addressed in 48 hours but not one called till now. No refund has has been made till date. > It's a pity that a company such as MMT can fail so badly to keep it's commitment to their customer.",1
1351,"Well, I booked a room for a night through make my trip website for hotel ana clark inn panchkula, to celebrate new year, next morning after check out, when I went to the parking, I saw my car rear door damaged. I contacted hotel, and make my trip, both of them are truly unprofessional, I have followed up for 10 days. requested for cctv footage, but they are least bothered, mmt is here just to collect margins on your hotel bookings. while booking they will show you hotel with parking facility, but when someone damages your car in parking, they are least bothered. mmt has 4 step complaint escalation process, which is completely useless, there executives will speak to you to resolve the issue, and after call they change complaint status to resolved. you have to reopen again. hopeless. don't book through them. this case happened just 20 kms away from my city, just think if you book some international tour for family, and god forbid, you face some issues . they will be least bothered, as they are booking agents.",1

I'm not able to talk to the customer care agents as the IVR routes me to use the app for any queries/complaints, how pathetic! When a customer has some emergency and needs some changes in the flight ticket, asking the customer to request it via email/chat is not the right approach. Anyway, as per their request, I did it in the app and till now I have not received any update from them. Earlier I was using makemytrip for most of my bookings but I reduced it due to their pathetic customer service. This incident again proved me making me not to use/recommend this website to anyone.",1
1355,"We were a group of 10 adults and 2 children traveling to Kerala on a 6 day tour for 6.40 lacks. The problem started right from the airport transfer. we were promised two vehicles for the pick-up as we were arriving in two batches at 2 and a half hours interval. We had been given the name of the two drivers in advance who were to come to airport to pick us up. only one vehicle turned up making the first batch of 9 people wait. All of 12 were huddled in one vehicle that did not have a luggage carrier. In the evening of day 1 the driver took us to an expensive gift shop against our wish and when we did not buy anything from the shop he started misbehaving, he deliberately parked the car 1 km away from the Chinese net the 2 octogenarians had to walk with great difficulty, No sightseeing could be done. Day 2, the Driver did not inform that the Synagogue closes at one pm and left us at the museum first, by the time we reached Synagogue it was shut we requested him to show us around the place we were staying in backwaters he refused. On our way to Kovalam we stopped for lunch, we asked the driver to put the AC of vehicle on when we started sitting in the car, he refused and said he will start the AC only after everyone has sat in the car. on the Day 5 we had planned for the day trip to Kanyakumari the driver reported 1 hour later than the decided time and informed that the permission from the RTO will take 2 hrs and we should take the boat ride, if we do the boat ride the RTO will inquire our details from the Boat provider, he also showed us the brochure of a Boating place, when we said we don't want to spend the time in sun and would like to wait in a shop called Kairali near the RTO he said in that case we all have to stand with him in the queue at RTO as the details of passenger need to be given to RTO when we did not follow him he abused us and threatened us with dire consequences. We cancelled our visit to Kanyakumari for the day. Make my trip coordinator was informed about the lapses and the misbehavior of the driver and requested for another vehicle so that local sightseeing could be done but another vehicle was provided the next day. Despite spending heavy amount we could not enjoy our trip due to Nonavailability of Luggage carrier, misbehaving driver, non provision of vehicles as promised at the time of booking with Make my trip.",1
1356,"I am a regular customer of Makemytrip availaing various services from them. I have booked cab from their website for the first time and it was a troublesome experience for our family. Firstly the cab displayed in SUV Category are Innova, Xylo but they alloted us Tavera which was priced 1500 Rs lower with local agents. It was a old vehicle having 200, 000 Kms completed. Driver Murugan was very rude, not respecting, didn't allowed use of AC, Music controls. Driving dangerously, continuous speaking on mobile and had a collision with another vehicle on the highway. He asked us to walk 1kms for pickup. He was not interested in taking us to sites of our interest but rather following his own routine and places of interest. I had called MMT customer support but no use after spending long hold on Automatic replies. MMT Cab service is highly not recommended to families who are in vacation mood as it seems they have less control on their cab service providers and drivers are unaware or not respecting terms of booking like Time, Kms allotment. Totally disappointed and was forced to write for helping other families in vacation mood.",1

This people claim to be the best travel agency in sri lanka but guys they are a nightmare once you land in SRI LANKA is when you’ll get to know about them. Make my trip Promised us the below •   Places to be covered-The driver which apple holidays gave did not know the places we ended up recharging for our internet and using google maps to travel to all locations. Because of this one entire day we were simply roaming trying to figure where the places are. They dint cover the places in the itinerary. •   English speaking chauffeur- Since we dint know the local language in srilanka make my trip promised we will have a English speaking driver to our shock the driver knew only one word in English that is “OK” anything you ask he says ok. everyday morning we get ready and wait for the driver they don’t come finally they come around 10:45 or 11:00 slowly and because of that we cannot cover the places in the itinerary .and you call apple holidays or Make my trip both the people will not pick your call and incase if they pick your call they ask for apologies only and they even sent a message “MAM PLEASE ADJUST AND ENJOY THE TRIP” •   Complementary massages and service – we were promised complimentary massages and free entry in few places but not even one we got and the most wonderful part was we even payed for the parking since driver dint have money. •   Discount vouchers for shopping- they said they will discount vouchers for shopping and not even one we got. A Hight of disappointment with make my trip and Apple holidays please do not book with them. we ended in an international place not knowing language spending so much money and got nothing except disappointment.,1
1361,"Kind Attn: Mr Amol Metkar With respect to the three bookings for 5 rooms dated 25th December to 27th December, I am still awaiting response from Make my trip as to why my rooms were released for booking without any cancellation advice from me. With 13 people travelling from various places for a family get together, I was informed on the previous day by wandertrails who manage whispering willows that my booking is not reflecting in their systems. And I was asked if I wanted to cooperate and adjust. With no time left to make any changes to my plan, I had to agree. Please answer me the following. Why my booked rooms were again made available for other bookings resulting in the same rooms booked twice. Why my booking was not on wandertrails records. Eventhough I had booked 4 months back. And wandertrails told me that they will only honor the bookings on their records. And try to work out a solution for me as a token of gesture. In spite of having a valid booking, I had to be at the mercy of wandertrails for their so called gesture. Why I was told by Wandertrails Business Development Manager that my booking has been cancelled arbitrarily by MMT and I have to check out immediately, leaving me with no choice but to cut short vacation. 5 of our families had to make emergency plans to travel back. On top of all this, no one from make my trip bothered to check with me if our stay at whispering willows is happening satisfactorily. Absolutely atrocious experience with MMT and Wandertrails.",1

1365,"I had a bitter experience with MMT cab service during my recent vacation. For a 3 hr one way trip I was delayed by 2 hrs and had to make several calls to several people, MMT, driver and vendor to get my issues resolved. There was initially a confusion on the pickup location in my booking, this was brought to notice of MMT well ahead of time but that was never communicated to the vendor by MMT. The vendor then took me for a ride giving all sorts of excuses and finally arranging a cab 1.5hrs late. Even after the trip started, MMT did not provide the OTP, I was further delayed with the driver halting the cab on the highway and making me pay the toll charges. It took another 1/2hr to receive the OTP from MMT resulting in 2hr delay in my trip. Based on this experience I took Ola cabs for my subsequent trip during the vacation and I could clearly see the difference in service. There were no surprises be it in cab booking, tracking, trip mileage and pricing. I would strongly recommend uber/ola service for outstation or rental services and avoid MMT who don't seem to have any control or responsibility of their service.",1

MMT has offered me with a great discount on a trip that a customer can need, the thing which I like most is their policy of full cancellation refund, refer and earn for a friend signup which can be availed for an upcoming future trip. Customer support system is very good and responsive to queries related to my bus enquiry check-in time.Overall from my side, I rated 4.5/5",3

I was wrongly charged by the driver, As per the MMT the balance amount that I have to pay was less than the actual amount I paid to the driver. When I made a complaint, they have added this/ that extra charges to the final bill and resolved the issue, There is always a discrepancy  what they show on their website and what we get . I have been charged for the parking at airport but drive was clever, he didnt paid parking charges that because parking was less than for 8 minutes, we were asked for the night charges and that was not told to me at the time of booking. Driver did rash driving and I informed the same, MMT nothing did anything about it. Driver taken almost 50 minuets of break and MMT did nothing about it, driver taken wrong route and MMT did is what they have added extra kilometers charges to my bill. What they actually did is they have given a justification about the wrong charges and closed the ticket. again its not MAkeMyTrip .it shuld be WasteMyTrip. Booking ID: NH7123161808991. Booked 2 star hotel at Nasik after reading good reviews on MMT and what we actually get at hotel was 2 star hotel, MMT says .Free wifi at hotel Actually we get: no wifi MMT says: water bottle and kettle at room: What we get: nothing of the above. MMT Says: clean room: Reality: Not actually. How MMT resolved my issue: given a 500 discount coupon for next booking( that is again their favour means when I will book hotel again form them only then I will get discout.clap clap clap) Hats of to .Waste My Trip.",2

Not too many details needed to be keyed in to sign up. > All the different options such as FLIGHTS, HOTEL, HOLIDAYS, BUSES, TRAINS etc are clearly visible hence one can easily choose the option that he/she is looking for. > I am delighted to write this point about the deals and the offers that are available on the website. I am so sure that the best hotel deals will be available only on Makemytrip.com. > The refer and earn program is awsome and yes I have indeed referred many of my friends and I have earned many thousands which I have already used for the bookings. > The Makemytrip.com application is downloadable from both the App-store and the Google Play and that user interface is almost like the same, userfriendly. >  I am happy with the Customer support department of Makemytrip.com as well.

I am a happy customer of Makemytrip.com. The only thing that I would like them to have a check on is the Bus booking services that they provide. I feel that they show less options. Rest all is fine. A definite 4.5/5 from my side.",4

1387,"Stayed at The Pleasant Haveli Jaisalmer from 21st of November to 25th, 2017. They sent a paid conveyance for transporting us from the airport. Friendly and cordial staff greeted us on our arrival. Booked a standard cosy room but after one night the management was kind enough to upgraded our room  to a Deluxe one. It was really a pleasant stay. The deluxe rooms are large enough. The room, washroom  and beds are very clean. The interior of the rooms reminds one of the old Haveli decor with modern facilities. A really nice and aesthetic blend.  Room has an almirah, small fridge, LCD, writing table and a chair. Washroom has a convex mirror and a hair drier, running hot and coldwater.  Housekeeping staff are well trained. Roof-top has a restaurant. Sitting place there is really awesome with a beautiful view of the Fort and the Jaisalmer city. A picture perfect reality of the rooms as displayed in photos on the internet and that delivered to us. The hotel is a little inside the main road and the surroundings are not clean but the interior of the hotel  is kept very clean. The management is extra careful about the comforts of the guests. You don't have to ask for any facilities, these are delivered  automatically. The owners themselves keep on attending to the needs of the guests. Overall a nice stay and a good experience. Recommended to all. Only standard cosy room No. 9 is a little out of place and may be avoided.",4
1388,"People may have good experience, people may have bad one. The one I am about to share here is a weird one. I booked an international flight ticket and recieved the confirmation mail from make my trip with the booking id. Then followed the invoice and e ticket which strangely was of some domestic flight issued on some strangers name but with same booking id. I contacted MakeMyTrip people over phone, over mails but ended in long call waiting and endless wait for useless mail replies. Then I happened to get connected with Mr Shahnawaz( MakeMyTrip team guy) . He was the only one sensible soul out there. Tho he got my booking reference number from the airlines directly but I never recieved my e tickets from MakeMyTrip. This is shocking. 1) how can they alot same booking id to two different journeys? 2) how can that person fly on a booking id meant for international flights? 3) how can MakeMyTrip behave so unprofessionally so as to ignore the matter till date( it's been 4 days now)? Even after talking to me over the phone they are sending me mail stating "" we are not able to connect you as your contact number is incorrect"" I Slam the unprofessional behavior of MakeMyTrip. I regret dealing through them.????????????",1
1389,Booked a oneway cab from Noida for 23/11/17 to drop at Agra. On its website the cars shown are very much clean and in new condition. Since I had booked a SUV expecting makemytrip would send innova or xylo as they have displayed innova only. When the cab arrived I was surprised it was a light Maruti Ertiga. Anyhow I had to travel at any cost. The driver drove at a speed of 130-140 km/hr on asking he replied he has to come back soon. What a service? putting our lives on risk expressway. On contacting makemytrip customer care I was informed the allowed speed is 60-80 km/hr only. Just see how the guy was crazy. Further the car was dirty not cleaned for so many days. Anyways my trip ends safely by the grace of God. I request all not to book cab from makemytrip com as you will not get the cab of your choice moreover putting you life on risk and facing unprofessional driver's behaviours.,1

1396,"Here is my detailed feedback for my Andaman Trip review(MMT Booking ID:NL20827650238) from 24th Sept to 29th Sept 2017. To start with a positive note: While looking for better deal MMT customer care executive are very polite and helpful. Trying to find a better deal for me. Simultaneously I was looking for other trip agency like yatra.com, travel triangle.com etc. Though I was getting a cheaper deal(Difference in price was around 35000 with a similar kind of itinerary.) with them I decide to go with Brand name like MMT so that I shouldn't beat around the bushes for small small thing. With all our expectation from MMT we boarded our flight thinking that everything will be smooth and memorable trip. As per the itinerary I was supposed to get driver detail from the airport pick up. But I didn't received any sms till the day of our Journey. Then I though sms will come may be after reaching PortBlair. After changing two flight we landed Portblair. I was expecting the sms. But there was no SMS about the cab driver info. Then Started the frustration .I tried to call to MMT customer Care they said driver will come shortly but didn't provided any sms or contact details. All the passenger by then already left to theier hotel. We are still waiting at the airport calling the MMT customer care frequently. more than 1 hour past, still I don’t have any idea about whats going on. Me and my family already started feeling low and disappointed with the service. after 1 hour the local coordinator(Vicky) approached with a hand written pla card with my name. I learned from Vicky that MMT gave my info to him in the night around 12 to 1 AM. Some how we checked in the hotel. The plan was for Ross island and Cellular jail. As we checked in the hotel so late we had lost our time. so we could make the visit cellular jail(I paid from my pocket for this where it should be spent by MMT as they already charged for it.) and light and sound show. And all of sudden came to know from Vicky we don't have Macruze ferry ticket for the next day trip to Havelock. This is 100% mistake of the MMT staff. Vicky told me he has all my travel info very last minute so there all ferry tickets are booked and nothing is available. Now My and my family Frustation at its peak. We keep on calling to MMT customer care. No help from your side. Instead you people said you can’t do anything from your side. We are going mad literally. because if we cann't make it today then all travel plan will be go on toss. My wife called to customer care and they(Madhavi/Simran etc.) said ""There is no way we can book a ferry for you today. you do one thing we will extend one more day stay in the same hotel. If you can, do it on your own. Very rude customer care executive"". My wife mentioned “we came here for the pleasure tour to visit the places not to stay in the room with four wall. My home is much more beautiful and bigger than your hotel. Why we will stay here?"" at the same time Hotel reception is threaten to vacate the hotel room as soon as possible as, it was supposed to be checked out at 8 AM and we are there in that hotel till 12 PM finding for the alternative to move out from this hotel. Finally offline I was trying with local vendor/people to get at least the govt ferry ticket(though paid for the Macruze price) so we shouldn't spend another day in the same hotel doing nothing but fighting with MMT customer care people. That day we might have called customer care more than 100 times. The MOST FRUSTATING MOMENT in my life .After requesting locally so many people I could manage the Govt ferry ticket by myself. The local trip coordinator Vicky was very helpful in this regard. Then we boarded the Govt ferry. The ferry is pathetic condition. ""Felt as if slave from Hyderabad being transported to Andaman Jail."" Cockroaches from every corner were. It was stinking and very untidy. Very pathetic condition. I felt so bad and blaming myself that Why I opted for MMT. Somehow we reached Havelock. Then we landed into Sea Shell resort and felt better after the frustrating day so far. By the time we reached the second day was almost over. All plans are gone wrong. No time for the planned events as per the itinerary. Next day it was planned for elephant beach/lighthouse beach with a boat ride and transportation. But nothing happened as the trip guide told that all of them are closed because of Bad weather. If we would have reached 1 day before as per the plan we could have made it. All the money they charged for transportation/share boat ride excursion etc. Nothing happened. Instead of all these we did snorkeling back yard of the same hotel. I believe we paid a premium amount for all these and hardly we did anything. and on the top of it lot of frustration. Some how we spent 2 night and moved to Neil's island. when Landed the taxi driver is asking to his coordinator whether He should switch on AC or Non AC. I was literally shouted and blasted  on him. How dare you asked this question. But more surprises are yet to come. When we  check in Pearl park beach hotel realize that MMT booked a non AC room inspite of confirming with MMT earlier. And above all the hotel owner was so cunning he was asking my kids age. When I said he is 7 then he is telling me he is going to charge extra for the kid. That room was not cleaned. It was stinking. Cockroaches from all corner. Cats also wanted sleep along with us. My wife was screaming and calling to the Hotel reception and saying that we can’t accompany Cat on our bed.  we spend 1 night there terribly. . My Frustration is on the Peak. I don't have any patience left and thought that this is not going to add any value instead of frustration so kept quite. Sadly we returned to portblair next day and we did one local trip ""chidiya tapu"" and next day morning boarded flight back to Hyderabad. By that time I don't have any energy left to Fight with you People Only thing I can do was send you a detailed feedback. And definitely I will discourage all my friends and relative to avoid MMT for any kind of tour or travel. After few days I got a call from MMT support executive Amit for the feedback. when I said I won’t even rate 2/5. Even 2 is very high. How do you expect a good rating with all the painful experience? Then he started explaining the incidents those are absolutely not relevant with my trip. He was talking about some hotel which I never checked in. he was talking all non sense and all irrelevant. I told him pls. wait for my written feedback I am going to send in few days. And I wanted to see what action your going to take with this kind of customer experience. So many places are not covered by MMT(though the premium amount charged by you) because of the timing issue(which you unable to manage, absolutely mismanagement, communication gap) as we couldn’t reach on time in the destination. With my above experience, I will think 10 times before booking any tour through MMT. Learned a lesson for life. Sad and Frustrated Customer Pravat Choudhury",1

1398,Recently I booked air ticket and hotel for GOA. Due to MMT poor customer service they are denying to pass hdfc card discount.and in hotel booking I started booking for two adults and two child but ended with a booking for two adults only.all fault in mmt app. 9415323117 Cash back on hdfc card resolved Thanks a lot but hotel booking log shared with me is incomplete as it is not showing the initial input of date place and members at the start of booking process after log in. I once again reiterate that I booked for 4 members but due to your app problem I got confirmation for two adults only. My budget is limited and I am in a fix as I can not cancel my booking as well as I can not afford extra charges from hotel for extra occupants. I am being forced for the error which is done by your faulty app and therefore it's MMT responsibility to provide accommodation to my kids also. Hoping for a resolution.,2

Neither make my trip has refunded us, nor they mail or sms us about cancellation of 2/11 ticket,  Nor indigo has sms or mail us about cancellation, airline is telling our email n contact number were not having with our booking details, as it was through make my trip. My suggestions to the travelers is to book from direct airline site &  Instead of partial cancellation one should do entire cancellation. Now we are after make my trip for our justice.",1
1400,I have installed an app in my mobile and after logining into the app website says that refer and earn accordingly I have done it I have referred my friend and I got Rs. 4500 and also it said that I can use this cash( as per terms and conditions) for booking the tickets. When I tried booking the tickets as per terms and conditions and at time of payment I am not able to use the wallet. Really stupid. I tried all the possible ways but it was not allowing me to use the wallet. My dear folks this is just waste of space in your phone or desktop,1

Because once you need some clarification you gone man.so plz plz plz keep refrain from it. there is no manner to care about customer as well our value is nothing.  once we booked from there, those people will not hear us back.",1
1402,"Made booking for hotel Sunshine Suites - Hebbal for stay on 11th Nov-2017. Cab driver found after reaching the venue on google map, there was no such hotel. Asked people around for existence of such hotel, but no one was aware of this hotel. These brokers like MakeMyTrip did not even verify before listing if such hotel exists. Just looting money of customers for listing fake hotels. Poor customer service by MakeMyTrip. MakeMyTrip - Earn money, don't loot money.",1
1403,"I had booked at hotel in Delhi. The MMT person calls up and tells me that due to some issue your original hotel can not be confirmed - this they did after sending confirmation Voucher. They provided horrible options of alternate hotels - far away from the location I had booked my Hotel. Spent over two hours talking to MMTrepresentative - first call received at 1804pm and later you claim to resolve by giving sub std far location hotel by 2021 hours. Will never book Hotel on MMT again. I called up the Hotel and they said MMT cancelled, we have rooms available. Unethical business behavior from MMT.",1
1404,"I attempted to book two train tickets though make my trip but its server worked only till my amount is debited and the amount reached their account. After that it sent me the message that it failed to book my tickets and I have to wait 15 working days(3 days from the side of make my trip and 12 days from the side of bank) to get refund. I was able to book the same train tickets directly through IRCTC it few minutes. I suspect the main aim of make my trip.com is to just pretent to service us and to hold our money in their account for 3 days which can give them interest. I would not be the only customer, it would be in lacks from whom they can collect money and make it hold in their bank account so that they could only make profit through holding our money rather than servicing us. What a good tactic or strategy followed by make my trip. It is their mistake who failed to book my tickets that too when there is availability and I lost my amount. Get profit from your service, if you rely on the other tactics to earn money you will be landing in troubles and this earning will not help you for long run .",1
1405,"I would like to share my experience about MakeMyTrip.com I am using Makemytrip around 4 year in this plateform mostly I have booked domestic flight ticket, train ticket, some time booked hotel. It provide me a perfect plan for trip and give me an good offer by which I can't forget it. it is user friendly website as everyone. We can use very easily. They have refund me the amount for which, I had to expend on a cancelled flight. It is true and honest in terms of service they offer. The support staff who refunded the amount, followed me until the complete amount is refunded. The best thing about their website is that it show real time reviews along with the best deal, as per my experience the reviews about the hotels are so accurate as per the rating. i'll always recommend MMT thank you",4
1406,"Once you are done with the initial payment there is no point of contact n these people ll nvr call u back.their customer support number n email id is of no use.their sales dept is very active until u pay the initial amount.i raised my query 3 times on their support id but no response called them up for 4-5 times  but there in noone to pick up the call.they ll simply say ""transferring your call to the concerned person"" but no one is there.seriously bullshit",1
1407,"I have been using Makemytrip for about 3 years now. It has been my go to website for all my travel arrangements. I have booked international flights, domestic flights, domestic hotel stays and international hotel stays with them multiple times. I have always double checked the discounts offered by MMT with multiple websites to check whether the discounts they had offered were valid or not and I have never been disappointed. MMT has always given me the best deals and has never failed to disappoint me. MMT has evolved drastically for the last 3 years, I have used the Desktop Application and the Mobile App and both are extremely user friendly, very easy to navigate and very precise. I personally prefer the Desktop Website because it gives the best deals, something I have noticed using MMT is that you can get better deals on the MMT Website than on the Mobile APP. I have never contacted their Customer Service team on the phone or via email, because I never felt the need to which of course is a good thing however I can't comment on how their Customer Service is. Even with stiff competition MMT has for me been the Best Travel Website ever. I am not saying this because of my loyalty towards them but because they have always proved to be the best in the market. However, no thing is perfect and there are a few things that they need to work on. They need to start updating information about the hotels they list. Location and Pictures for a lot of hotels are out dated. They need to give similar offers on both the Desktop Site and the Mobile App, it just seems unfair. They need to stream line their Client response system, they send too any emails and texts. Finally, MMT has given me the ability to confidently make my travel plans without having the fear of CANCELLATIONS! Cheers to MMT.",5
1408,"I never expected such a blunder done to a regular customer by India’s #1 Travel company, founded by an alumnus of Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad. Due to MMT Team's inefficiency and carelessness we lost INR 40, 526/- and left us in mid-way in foreign country. Here is the summary of misleading information provided in full holiday package to SriLanka. Vouchers provided just a day before departure after giving many follow-ups and reminders. Timings were not discussed for pickup and drop in SriLanka Airport. Timings were nowhere mentioned in provided itinerary. Flight details were not shared with the vendor(Apple Holidays). PFA. Itinerary and flight details are mismatched hence the vendor also followed itinerary and dropped us a day after the scheduled departure. As per itinerary/vouchers, it is clearly mentioned on ""Day 8: Colombo to Negombo with overnight stay, Day 9: After breakfast checkout from hotel and proceed to Colombo Airport for your departure."" Not mentioned in last hotel voucher(Negombo) about the early checkout. As per ""Service Confirmation Voucher"" it is clearly mentioned Pickup date is 14th OCT and Number of days are 9. There was no intimation from MMT or vendor to board the flight as scheduled. We were following the MMT itinerary and Service Confirmation Voucher for our holidays been rest assured that every detail would have been matched by MMT. After calling your emergency 24/7 support team, your executives denied helping in this matter and asked us to book another flight from MMT only by our self and ensured us that they will consider the matter for refund. New booking ID: NN7299720883342. Since then we are following repeatedly but they are not willing to get into the root of the matter and closing our case without fair resolution and not ready to accept mistake done by sales executive(Lok Bahadur). I personally hope you will look in to this matter for inconvenience created by MMT and monetary loss.",1
1409,Today I am going to give my reviews on make my trip.com friends this site really frustrate me because I had very horrible ecperience from this site. Last year I made one room booking from this site when I went to jaipur at that moment they registered my booking and said they booked the room with my name and when I reached there the person who was in reception said they dont have any empty room suddenly it frustrate me really hard and I get angry with that person when I curse him and scold him then he booked another room for me. This is the only reason I dont believe with this site.,1
1410,"Last diwali I have booked bus one day before Diwali for Amar travelers. Timings were 10 PM to 9: 00 AM from Anand Vihar.I was ready to go to Anand vihar to 8 PM n suddenly I get a call from the travler that reach at Kasmiri gate as that bus was cancelled due to fault. When I reached at Kasmiri gate and met with the guy who called me , he get me to a different travel agent office when I asked them why the travler got changed he said it is due to diwali crowd we have shifted you to different bus.I have ignored it n due to excitement for going to home town I forget those movements and sit in the bus finally Bus start very late about 1 AM and there are very few passenger sitting n condition of bus was very bad no charger plug working, ac not working properly, bus conductor charged me Rs 133 extra in between the journey, They have dropped me at Kanpur when I asked the driver then he told me that bus is not full of passenger and we will bring you to another bus of same travel company.All passenger have waited around 2 hrs on bus stop with the conductor but no bus was reached n then finally conductor has asked to sit in Govt road ways general bus and he payed the amount from Kanpur to my destination.Finally I reached at my place at 9 PM means there was delay of 12 hrs that was very painful , I was also got sicked due to long hrs journey n my Diwali get smashed off due to this. After one day when I complained this to MMT then they said they don't get involved in travler  descisions n they have there own terms and condition. This is very frustating from too big brand , don't know for other services from MMT but the bus service is very bad.This was my horriable expirence.",1
1411,"I had to revert to writing this review to check if it just me facing the hassle. For the past few flight bookings, each time, I try to book, I get a confirmation from my bank that the payment has been made to Makemytrip but the confirmation and itinerary is not given by Makemytrip on grounds that payment has not been received. Long phone calls to customer service are also not helpful to the point of being ridiculous. The refund take 5-7 days to come through. Today 11: 59 pm 4th November, I tried making a flight booking, made the payment, received SMS confirmation from my bank, but Makemytrip says they did not receive the payment. When I spoke to customer care, first they said the payment was not received, and after long insistence, he said he will initiate ""REFUND"". if Makemytrip did not get the payment, how did he commit to initiate the refund! And surprisingly, within 15 minutes post booking ""FAILURE"" with Makemytrip, when I made a booking through another travel site, I was able to make the booking and received itinerary confirmation instantly. The customer service supervisor refused to attend my call after the customer service agent was not able to answer my questions. I would take it that there is something fishy going on with flight bookings on this site.",1
1412,"As the word says Make My Trip is mostly focused on travels and journey bookings. Almost all booking is available fro Train, Bus and Flights. Service and support that is issued by the Make My Trip is very genuine and it meets the requirements of the needy.  We can contact them at anytime and the reply messages are given so fastly. That is the only thing which I liked in using Make My Trip. I have a registered account in Make My Trip app and I got 1000 rupees as bonus for inviting one friend to these Website. So with that money I went to book one bus ticket and I got disappointed. At that time only they are revealing that the bonus cash is not eligible for booking the tickets directly. If we are planning to book tickets then through this bonus cash we will get 5% discount. These 5% discount does not make any sense because Make My Trip is taking an amount as transaction charges which is equal to this. At any point Make My Trip reveals this point. Only at the last minute  when we go for bookings, we will understand that. For a fresher who has not used any online sites for bookings these will be a cheating. Many adds are also present in websites which also disturbs our movements. Loading time is less when compared to other sites. We are able to reach the destinations fastly.",1
1413,I have very worst experience with make my trip. I had booked hotel royal mirage morjim Goa through MMT. We booked two for 3 nights 4days @ 4600/- per night. But when we reached there the hotel person had no manners and the rooms r very worst. it was not worth it which amt we paid and they given us one room at upside and another on ground floor near the kitchen and reception desk was. Room was very worst in condition. We all r with family so we decided not to stay here and cancel the booking so we talked with hotel's person he told us that cancel from where you booked so we called customer care executive of MMT that time she said if hotel's concern person saidcancel then we will cancel and refund your amt. Which is 18000/- approx. Then the boy talked with someone on phone and he said cancel the booking and he cut our customer executive call.then we again called that time that person of MMT told us cancellation is possible but you didn't get any refund and again the race of rabit and turtle going on. Hotel person told to talked with MMT and MMT executive told to talked with Hotel concern person. In between this conversation we spend more than 2hrs and my children was hungry and still we was fighting with them. Till we was not check in coz the hotel quality was very cheap we can't aishwaryasingh23 18000/- for this cheap rooms. Then we told MMT executive to transfer our rooms to another hotel if you not refund us our money then they said it's not possible. This option was given to hotel person sudhir who cannot cancel our booking but he also not given positive response to us. Then we leave that hotel and search new hotel for stay but still 11.00 pm We not got any hotel to stay still my kids r hungry and we all r on the road at other state. Actually we trust this fraud company MMT but they broke our trust and give us mental harrasement. Pls give your opinion on it. I will never suggest anyone to book your hotel staying with this fraud company. They lost their Goodwill. Pls think 100 times when you booked anything with make my trip. This is MMT's responsibility to see the hotel quality and then suggest. This is totally financial and mental harrasement with us.and still you ppl told us that y you cancel the booking. We don't know the rules that executive must told us about it.,1
1414,"I had planned a birthday trip to Allepey, Kerala for my friend this September and made all my bookings through the very prestigious Makemytrip website. The very highlight of Kerala is a houseboat and I had booked one through this site as a surprise for him. But who could have guessed that even after one gets a confirmation mail with all his booking details from this website, there is a possibility that the real hotel hasn't been booked for him? So, two hours before checking-in to the houseboat, I call the respective travels and ask them about where to board it. They tell me that there is no booking made by my name. I call makemytrip thereafter, and they tell me that there is, infact, a booking made on makemytrip. They call me back after 10 mins and tell me that due to some technical error they couldn't make a booking in the houseboat but I recieved a confirmation. A technical error that they themselves never realized but were waiting for me to call them in the very last minute. So now, if they had simply told me that they will refund all the money that I gave them, I could have still booked a new houseboat for myself. But they didn't. They asked me to wait and assured me that they will find a new houseboat. Now, never ever believe this website and it's executives when they talk about ""assurance"" because they definetely don't understand the meaning of it. They kept me waiting for the next two hours, and in the meantime I had called makemytrip more than 10 times, talked to more than 10 new executives, explained my whole situation more than 10 times and each one of them ""assured"" me that they will call me back with a list of available houseboats in the next 15 minutes and none of them ever did. So after two hours, this female named ""Chandrima Hazra"" called me and used all her manipulation skills to convince or better say, befool me that there are no houseboats available anymore though they were available two hours back when they had found the glitch but they obviously were very very busy scrolling through Facebook or instagram and couldn't work on such a high priority issue then. Then I talked to a more senior executive who was even better than her and suggested me to find a houseboat locally. So we go to random new cities now and with all the technical evolution we have achieved, we must go find hotels locally and not trust these online websites anymore. You should agree to this when an executive who works there himself suggests so, right? So after perfectly destroying my friend's birthday, they threw a new bait and sadly, we had to agree to it since there was no other choice left. They said that they will refund the booking amount and the discount amount as well as a token of apology for their mistake. So we agreed to this and let it go, The booking amount was refunded in a week and there is no sign of the discount in my bank account yet. It has been more than a month and every time I call them, they give me very innovative ""assurances"" like the accounts team will call me or the executive himself will look into it and call me back in sometime or the lady, ""Chandrima Hazra"", who had fooled me then will get in touch and none of this has ever happened. Which company or bank takes more than a month to transfer money? This website or any other website is not reliable at all and may just leave you homeless in a random new place, neither will  they ever be apologetic at all about how unprofessional and irresponsible they are. I will recommend all of you to go and book hotels locally as I was suggested by MakeMyTrip itself. I have uploaded screenshots of the two very prominent mails since we are allowed to only upload two pictures here. The first one is of a makemytrip official mail which sent me only the booking amount as the refund amount. On again contacting the executive I have mentioned many times in this review, ""Chadrima Hazra"", she sent me a very informal mail which mentioned the full amount that was to be refunded including the discount price. This behaviour looked highly unprofessional to me as she couldn't even draft a grammatically correct email for such an important issue and it was my mistake that I didn't ask for an official mail from makemytrip for this. My booking id is-NH7106263032230",1

We had a 4 days tour from  Hyderabad to Cochin. We had a nice flight journey. Then there we have a local cab waiting for us and driver was also friendly. Hotel accommodation for 2 days is also very satisfying and we also had a nice time in the alleppey ( boat house)  for one day. The good thing about their website is that it show real time review along with the best hotel deals. I recommend everyone to use this app for better satisfaction.",5

1420,"I would like to describe my experience with MMT(which is in fact a huge brand name), provides worst customer service, treats customers badly once the payment is made. Lots of faults and bugs in their app and functionality which they didnt care to accept as their mistake. So, I made a booking for a hotel(non refundable), due to some emergency situation I could not reach on that date, So instead of cancelling there was an option provide to modify the booking dates. I proceeded with the modifying, No notification, No prompts were shown to me, directly booking was cancelled. Its been more than a month now that am following up with CC of make my trip, No response, No call backs, No care for the issue raised. Today wen I demanded to talk with the manager or some senior supervisor, I got a reply back that Its my fault that I tried modifying the booking. So no refund or anything will be provided. I lost like 10K behind this stupid MMT. Now all I can say is Never use MMT, always prefer direct bookings.",1

1423,I have been chasing Varsha who booked our Europe Trip to arrange a call back for Rescheduling my Trip to Europe as my Daughter's Visa got cancelled. Literally entire day me and my wife chased to get one call back. We had Preety calling us for re-scheduling and we provided all the details and she said she will call back which never happened. I called customer care and spoke to Adil and he promised he will arrange a call back and he said he has sent the email to the concerned department. When requested to send the same email to me he said he has sent to my yahoo account which never came which doesn't surprise me as I have this experience for past 2-3 weeks of my association with MMT.com as even your supervisor cheat on people by saying they will call back which never happened. One Mr. Bandesh Mob No. 85270 78739 was appointed as my Trip handler and he never responds to email or even picks my call. He is the most Frustrating support manager I believe you have in MMT. He is just disgusting. The most 2 surprising aspect of this booking was when 1) I requested to Assist in Visa for My Daughter and Wife on 4th October for my trip on 30th October 2017 the answer was due to Diwali coming we will not get visa before our departure and I had to do the Visa process myself and I got the Visa done for my Wife. If I could how come being an agent they are incapable of doing so. 2) I have booked a Europe Trip and no one and I must emphasize no one ever followed up to brief us on the upcoming tour and give support. Zero personal touch in this trip. My booking ID IN1710B9S4496650.,1
1424,I had done a CAB Booking for myself for 22nd October 2017 from Puducherry to Chennai(3 to 4hr journey one way) I was unwell and was down with viral fever. I had opted for MMT Cab bookings as while coming to Pondicherry from Chennai they provided me a good car. I had my booking at 1pm to return home safely to the Airport. But I never knew MMT was going to show me the worst Nightmare of all times. They happend to send me a message(at 12:30pm)that my car booking which was at 1pm shall be cancelled due to non availability of cars!. R U SERIOUS!. I tried connecting them on various numbers but none was working. I tried each and every source as being unwell was making my health deteriorate more but still nothing was considered. Alas a number connected and when I asked them to help me book an alternative they DECLINED! They just kept saying we can't help you. I only know how have I made alternative preps and have got back home. BUt this was UNACCEPTABLE!. I wouldn't recommend anyone to book cabs via MMT. I am a blogger on Tripadvisor I used to advice travellers for booking via MMT. I think I have changed my mode of replies. I henceforth won't ever consider MMT as my travel partner. I better switch to GO IBIBO or Yatra. Once bitten I wouldn't dare to go down that lane again.,1

1430,It's the worst you can do to your travel. I had booked a ticket from MAKEMYTRIP FOR 12/10/2017. First I received the e-ticket. I tried several times day prior to confirm my booking & terminal. But none of their phone numbers work. You will not be informed about the TRAVEL DEPARTURE TERMINAL. you will only be allowed to put a request but you will never get a response back. If you cancel forget about your refunds. THe point system is a gimmick 1st they add extra charge & then reduce it as per your travel date. The hotels everything they provide is false. when you reach your final destination you will realize it yourself but u'll be helpless. I REPEAT AGAIN NEVER BUY TICKET OR HOTEL ACOmMoDATION FROM MAKEMYTRIP UNLESS  u want to really screw it up.,1

This was my bad experince with make my trip.I booked bus ticket on make my trip from patna to kolkata. It gave me pnr number and alltoted seat number. It charged was high extra hundred rupee by the way I was ok with that because I am in hassle. When I reached patna bus stand and sat my alloted seat number. After few minute bus opeartor came near me and said it is not your seat it was booked by me and I had alloted some other person. After lot of discussion I had abandoned my seat. I showed my ticket, the bus operator told me I do not know about online ticket. I said ok book another ticket for me , he said no one seat left. I was amazed. My meeting was held next day.i need to go. After lot of talk I said I pay extra money he said what I can I do there are no seats availble. Then I choose another way.

1436,"I have paid for Indigo Flight E tickets on 1st October miodnight through makemytrip.com.  Rs6924  deducted from my axis bank account.But, not received any confirmation via mail or sms.I have raised this issue in their website, but they mailed next day that it will be rectified soon. I have waited to book air tickets, but they replied that payment is not received. I contacted their customer care number, but the person didnt attend the query that it is not their department. At the same day, I got an sms to my mobile 9645954155 that payment is received. It created lot of confusion. Next day, their customer care contacted me and told, it is not their website complaint, but an error from their payment gateway.He abused me that it is customer's mistake. I wonder how they behave like this much amateur way. I have transacted from their website makemytrip.com and money is deducted from my account. Yet, they criticise a customer without any reason. I have mailed again.They asked bank statement. I have mailed it again. I have attached it in initial query at website earlier. Now 5 days are passed, They are still asking bank statement even after I have send them it twice. I have not received my transacted amount back. I think, this company is totally irresponsible and dont value customer's money. Or they are trying to loot customers in fraudulent manner by pretending. A good ecommerce firm should be able to execute the transaction without error. If any error happens, they should rectify it wthin 24 hours and pay back the money. This is my experience and I think it is high risky for any customer to book e tickets via this company. because, they are not all supportive or helpful. Regards, Sony Joseph",1
1437,"I am a student. I don't have excess money but since we want to enjoy our life we plan our trips based on the limited budget we have. So we planned for mysore and started searching for hotels. I found a hotel, located on the main road at 645rs and astonishingly it had a cashback of 450 rs. I was very happy to get a good room at so low cost. So we booked it, stayed there for a day and came back. When I checked for cashback it had come to makemytrip account. I was very impressed. Then a friend of me had to go somewhere and wanted me to book a room for him since I had cash back. But when I tried to boom the room I couldn't use the cash back. It was limited only 100rs was being used. I was totally disappointed. This cashback is not a refferal cashback to have a limit. I paid my money for it. The next time you see cashback on makemytrip donot get fooled",1

When I contacted MMT, they initially showed that they could help. But I suddenly get a call saying that nothing can be done. I lost an amount of money which was huge for me, spoiled my day and very importantly spoiled my trip. There should be some convenience for your customers if things go wrong technically. Or even if it was my fault to not re-check the dates, some provision should be there. I'm writing this review since this is not the only negative experience I have had with them. I choose to discontinue using their services and would surely advise my friends and family to do so too.",1

1445,"Hello All, Today I am writing my worst experience with MMT. I am frequent user of MMT and never face such type of issue earlier. In month of April, I have booked my flight for family from Kochin to Bali. During that time MMT had some offers on international flights with different Bank Credit Cards. One of them offer was with HDFC bank CC which gives cash back of Rs 4000 on more then 40000 transaction and 8000 on more then 80000. This offer was valid only on every Thursday. As I am carrying HDFC Card, I have booked my flight on Thursday and applied coupon code. On the payment summary page I found msg of 4000 rs cashback. When I went to payment page, MMT given provision of part payment. They asked me to pay 20% and remaining 80% within 48 hours. I made part payment & remaining after 48 hours. Till that time I was able to see my cash back details. After my journey I made call to MMT to inquired about my cashback and they told me to wait for 90 days for cash back process.  I have seen that normally every cash back process taking 3 months. So I trust them and waited for 90 days. Now Today after almost 5 months when I asked for my cash back then they denied. Initially they told me there is no cash back coupon find with my ticket. When I explain them everything along with coupon code then they agreed about the code. But now they come up with new T&C and told me that Cash back is only applicable for full payment. I am not able to understand how cash back is correlating with partial\full payment.  Cash back was given based on total Fare and also on Credit Card. So definitely person can book full\partial payment using credit card. Gress period for remaining payment was just 48 hours not 3-4 month so 4000/8000 cash back will adjust again the transaction. Even at time of booking I have preferred veg food as I am Hindu Brahmin but they have booked non veg meal and was not printed in ticket. I just check food details at time of Web check in and I immediately call them to change my food. Still I loss my paid meal from Kochin to KL as I ask for change within 24 hours. 2 Years back I have booked my USA flight from 2 different credit cards(partial payment) and I got cash back benefit on my both credit cards. So It's really fraud by them. So pls be aware of the cash back stuff by MMT. I have lost faith from MMT and appeal everyone to aware of cash back fraud.

1448,"Hi All, Please do not book your holiday trip with Make My Trip. If you are educated and know to browse better do self booking rather than aishwaryasingh23ing them full amount and after that doing all the bookings by our own. I will share my experience here. As it was our first international trip I thought of not taking risk and done my booking through Make My Trip by aishwaryasingh23ing 59000 Rs. The only thing which went hassle free was Visa processing and transfer from Airport to Hotel. The worst part I faced are as follows. There was no proper communication passed to us regarding the Airline baggage details To connect with a person it took min 30 mins. I have contacted them any times for information but different people passes different info and finally got the reply to check with Airlines directly for more info.We lost around 3000 Rs extra due to this miscommunication. We arrived at the hotel and was really shocked to hear that the aishwaryasingh23ment was not made and hotel denied our entry.There was no direct contact number provided to us and somehow we took new sim and we called the customer care service and informed. Each time we call a different representative will pick the call and we need to tell the entire stories and need to wait another 15 min to get connected to proper department.They kept us waiting in hotel lobby for almost 1 hr feeling embarrassed. Our entire day got spoiled.Finally we decided to aishwaryasingh23 from our hand  and Make My trip representative agreed us to refund the amount. They refunded the exact amount after 3 days.If we have booked by our own we could have entered into hotel without any worries. 3.The itenary details and timings were not provided in advance. When checked for that again they created confusion and asked us to contact directly to different agencies. 4.The day before our return travel as we were no more having trust with these people and as the time mentioned in the pickup voucher and flight timing was different, I called to return pickup agency contact number directly and came to know that return pick is not confirmed as they were not updated with my details. I have given them the details that night as the flight was scheduled in early morning 6 AM and the time mentioned in voucher was 8 AM. 5.As the service was very poor I just made an inquiry regarding the split up of expense actually needed for the journey through different sITES_Company and agencies and came to now that nearly we are aishwaryasingh23ing 20000 for their service charge and getting this worst service. Think twice before you book your trip through MMT. My booking id NL20833680171 and mail id is Siji2809@gmail.com.My Contact number is 7736659357.

Thankfully, we were not ATTACKED / ROBBED / KIDNAPPED(yes, that happens in Moscow in some neighborhoods) - WE WERE ABSOLUTELY HELPLESS THAT NIGHT - we knew nobody, we did not know the language, we did not know the streets, and no taxis / buses wee running at the time, only the metro trains. Thankfully, the night manager of the hotel where we were staying, a Russian lady(fluent in English), was able to help us at that time(around midnight) when we called her - SO, A RUSSIAN(hotel's night manager, Ms Marina) HELPS US, AN INDIAN(MakeMyTrip's Moscow agent Gaurav) DOES NOT!

Had made a booking with MMT from Mumbai to Pune for a cab with booking ID NC750983592412686 for which I got an estimation for 296 kms above which every km is charged Rs.12.5 After the journey the driver told me that the total kms travelled were 382 kms. When I told the executive to check on Google the distance from my pick up location to drop location, he checked and told me to pay only for 322 kms. After some time the executive tells me that he forgot to tell me that I have to pay for 20 kms extra for drivers traveling distance from his place to my place.& told me that these charges are mentioned in their terms& conditions. which is a lie. Hidden charges which they tell u after u finish ur journey. Why should I pay more than what I have travelled? Highly regret of having made a booking with MMT.  BEWARE of MMT!

1462,"Hello friends, today I want to share my review about this site, this is India's most common travel site. This is the only 6site which spend allot for its advertisements, at the end all its advertisement expenses we need to bear as a end customer. Please refer below points for details. Service and support : company has many offices in every city from there they provides there services and support. support function is good, but they always suggest some expensive products as they have good profit margins in expensive products. Information depth : There sales executive provides overall information but they never provide depth information , because they know if you go in deep you can find things by your own. Content : They provide OK OK type content They never go into detail in terms of Hotel details, Insurance policy, Local transport and local food. 4.User friendly : The site is user-friendly which is very easy to operate but content and information is not up to the mark. Time to load : Some times this site take lot of time to download and you may get coding errors. Unnecessary expensive : I found this site is little expenstive, I would suggest everyone before booking anything from site compare other sites to you will find the price differences .",1

1470,"We were on a trip to Arunachal Pradesh in the month of February. We book a hotel through MakeMyTrip at Tawang, Arunachal Pradesh. The hotel name was Ugyenling. We book hotel 3 months earlier than our journey. On that day on which our hotel was booked, we receive a phone call from MakeMyTrip official. They asked us whether we reached the hotel or not. We told them we are on our way to Tawang by our private car and will reach at night. Then they told us ok and cut the phone. When we entered Tawang it was evening and we got a dark atmosphere everywhere. After that, we got a call from there officials asking whether we reached the hotel or not. That time we are little surprised. Because we traveled a lot and no online site calls whether the customer reached the hotel or not. So we told them we reached Tawang but did not locate the hotel till now and we are searching the hotel. Now after asking address to the local people, we entered at a place where the situation is like a blackout. There were no shop which was in open state. There were no house where there is any light. In short there were no light in that place. There were no street light also. After searching a lot we found our hotel. And we saw that there were no one in that hotel . It was completely dark and a lock at the gate. After asking for a lot of time we found the hotel owner. We told them about our booking. They told us that there was a festival was going on at that place. So everyone was on a holiday. And theirs hotel is also closed for that time. And they know about our booking so thay informed that to makemytrip and refund all the money to the site. Then we understand why the site officials call us. They know that the hotel was closed. But they took us in complete darkness. They neither informed us about it nor they refund us any money. How much we trusted them about our tour in a unknown place but they only cheat us. After that we call their customer care number. The officials took the phone after a lot try at their toll free number which was always busy. After knowing our problem they make our call in hold by saying that they transfer the call to their higher officials. That time there were a chilling cold at tawang. And we were tend to freeze. Our parents were also with us. They are old and also feeling tired and ill after the long journey from Bomdila. There we got another hotel at locality with very poor condition and much higher rate but the problem was if we took that makemytrip did not refund us any money. After waiting for 2 and half hours at the chilling cold and complete blackout environment we finally got a call from makemytrip officials. They told us about another hotel at a far place named hotel zaxstar. After reaching there we got to know that they arranged rooms there for us. This was very horrible evening for us. I would suggest please dont trust makemytrip. They are  cheater. This was not the end. The hotel owner of the hotel Zaxstar also cheater. They took extra money with our food bill which food we even not ordered. When we ask them they told us they provide that food to our driver. So we pay them the money. After that we got to know that the driver not ordered anything from the hotel. This was our experience with makemytrip. After that we never book any service from makemytrip.  Please do not trust them. If you book hotel from them call the hotel owner directly to make it confirm. And if you are not able to contact the hotel owner then dont trust only the site. Please call another hotel nearby and if you got confirmation from the hotel owner then only book it from the site.",1
1471,"Hello Guys ! I am going to tell you about the travelling and Hotel booking website MakeMyTrip.com.I have used it for some time and currently also using it. CONCEPT of this is that_ it provides several options related to Ticket Booking, Hotel Booking and Trip Organising as well.On this we can book these things very quick and at very much options but actually the FARE RATE is too much and generally not suitable for someone._ In starting it also provides BONUS POINTS by joing and sharing to others but does not provide the facility to use them efficiently and if can be used but a partial part of them like 20% of them. I have received 750 Rupees while joined but what happend to me I was not allowed to use them at a point and not even partially.So I can say all it is FAKE. SERVICE & SUPPORT is providing through Mails to our Email Id.As it also has app as well so as per portability it is good.That means It is somewhere USER FRIENDLY as well.But only for show up purpose because if they are not satisfying the users like me then there is no worth to join there. INFORMATION DEPTH and CONTENT is there as it shows all the various options avalable related to the ticket and hotel bookings. At last I can say DO NOT JOIN & USE MakeMyTrip. #Not Worthy at all.!",2
1472,"MakeMyTrip.com is the best and the finest website to book tickets online.This site is totally trusted and provides various features and discounts over the tickets.

1473,"MakeMyTrip is an online site which books hotels, bus, flights, and whole trip for you. Be it national or international destination it offers great and cool cashbacks. I booked a bus on make my trip on 02/08/2017 and a hotel in Siliguri. The regular bus ticket costs 350/- INR from my hometown to Siliguri and the room I booked costs 800/- INR/night. I got the bus ticket in 275 INR /- and room in 500/- INR so on total I got cashbacks worth 350/- INR so it was great for me plus I didn't have to visit too many hotels. I just took a taxi and reached my hotel. So this was truly hastle free. People who travel without prebooking know the pain. So try this out",5
1474,I have used this app for my first I international trip . They gave me awesome discounts on my flight tickets and on my hotel bookings. You can use this app to book intetnational hotels also. Refer a friend and get money in your wallet n you can use that wallet money for all ur bookings. Recently I booked my bus ticket and got bettet discount than compared to othet travelling apps,5
1475,"I had booked my domestic flight on 18 june, but for some reason I wasnt able to go for it and initiated the refund process on 23 june . As per guidelines, the cancellation fees applied and I was to be refunded my amount within 7-10 days. After repeated reminders and having a word with make my trip team, I was assured of my refund within 2-3 days. The whole gruesome procedure kept on repeating and I was given false hopes on each time, I had a word with team head of their after sales service staff and grievance cell. Its been more than 50 days, but they havnt even initiated my refund process through first stage as submitted in screenshot taken through make my trip app .The kind of pathetic and redundant services, make my trip provides makes it a worst and the most undesirable platform to book tickets. Such a big comapny has failed my expectations on every level and highly recommend not to book anything through them, if you dont want to have an ugly experience. 0/5 my review for them",1

I HAD ALSO PAID THE MONEY FOR THE SAME. BUT MAKEMYTRIP FORGOT TO CONFIRM WITH THE AIRLINE. MISTAKE . MY CLIENTS WENT TO THE AIRPORT IN THE MORNING. THE AIRLINE SAID THAT YOUR TICKETS ARE NOT BOOKED. WE CALLED MAKEMYTRIP. NO ONE IS READY TO HELP US. WORST SERVICE. NO ONE PICKING UP PHONE CALLS. WE LOST OUR FLIGHT. MY ALL CONNECTING FLIGHTS ARE LOST. ALL HOTEL BOOKINGS LOST. WE WERE NOT ABLE TO CANCEL ANY BOOKINGS. TOTAL LOSS OF 700000 INR. TODAY ALSO WE ARE CALLING MMT FOR THE SAME. NO ONE IS RESPONDING. MMT IS SAYING IT IS YOUR MISTAKE. WE DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO.

1479,"Recently we had an opportunity to travel to Shimla & Manali through Make My Trip. Our  experience with Make My Trip is not great but forgettable. We advise tourists  to avoid Make my Trip, if possible. Mainly service is very poor. They charge you for  AC Sedan car & then switch off AC throughout the trip make your life difficult especially if you go in summer . Your feed back has no effect on them & they don't respond to your problems. There are other good tour organizers like Yatra .Com, Cox & Kings etc. We regret having gone through MMT",1
1480,"I have booked flights, trains and buses many times on makemytrip. This time however, the experience was not the same. Reference ID: [170729-001882] I booked a flight through makemtrip from Kolkata to Ghy which cost me an amount of 7176 rupees. I had applied a coupon code for students and they said they will offer 10% discount for students as cashback after the transaction after I submitted them student ID via email. Its been a week since I contacted them but alas no responce from their side. I feel cheated as they said they would provide the cashback post booking. Horrible experience on MMT. Hope it does not happen to anyone else.",1
1481,"I selected Makemytrip holidays for my Eastern Europe trip for parents. I wanted a conducted trip for my parents where they will be taken around and their every need catered to by a constant tour manager present with them. Make my trip agent pushed me to take ""elegant Eastern Europe trip"" On conveying my concerns that my parents are senior citizen who need a guided trip, the agent assured me that the trip he is offering is completely guided, He said there will be tour manager to cater to all their needs. He assured me that once I drop them to Viennna airport tour will be taken care of by tour manager from there on wards. There will be a whatsapp group created so that other co passengers travelling with them can be in touch. He also assured that tour manager details will be shared a week before the travel. With all this assurance I was happy and went ahead with the booking. Then one week before tour I waiting for the briefing call from them "" there was none"" also there were no whatsapp group! there was no tour manager! they simply provided us with vouchers for transfer from one city to the other! there was no tour manager or co passengers! My parents were on their own in foreign land not aware of the local language! If this is the trip I wanted for them I could have very well booked the hotels, transfers and hop on hop off services myself online! why did I need Makemytrip for that! I booked with them for service which the failed to provide! They are not fit to be called number one! I was given fake information and duped by makeMyTrip! The worst experience ever!",1
1482,"Hello everyone, Makemytrip.com and MakeMyTrip mobile app have surely came far to become one of the most trusted and finest Travel Booking Startups in India. I have been using MakeMyTrip for past 2 years and since then it has never let me regret up on any deal I have booked from them. Service and Support - Makemytrip offers a 24x7 customer support where they will help you with your problems. I haven't been in trouble with them so I cannot exactly tell you how there service is. Information Depth - There was time I used to book flight tickets with this website choosing my own seat preference but now a days I can't see that info there. Other than this I don't feel anything wrong with the information they provide. Content - They provide booking of Flights, Hotels, Trains, Holidays and even cabs now. Overall, I liked there content. Time to load - As I told you they have come far ahead in the service they provide and this was a problem earlier that the site and app took time to load, but now it's solved and I don't feel any other website provides this kind of speed in travel booking. Other features include Refer and Earn, I have earned around 7000 from them by just referring 4-5 persons and you can use this money later for booking. No other site in this segment provides this feature, So MakeMyTrip is all you need for any sort of travel booking. You can see these screenshots provided by me to refer how refer n earn works what the home page looks like.",5
1483,"The reason why I like this website is really simple. It shows you the cheapest. Sometimes even more cheaper than the own airlines official website. They will give you extra discounts and great deals like pay 50rs extra and your flight will include option of free cancellation which is great for frequent flyers. For more, I was travelling in Europe for last 2 months and I used to book  3 star hotel for the same price for which my foreigner friends were booking their hostels. This website makes bookings for discounted price and makes invoice for the real price to show in hotel. This means you pay the discount price and still gets a high quality hotel. My first experience with this website was extra ordinary. I booked a 4 star hotel for just 205 Rupee ( less than 3 Euros) for one night in Poland capital Warsaw. After this, wherever I am planning to go next, I use to look on makemytrip 10 days before and almost booking rooms for 900 RS to 1500 RS for standard twin room, which means 450 ruppes to 750 rupees for night in 3 star hotel. After half trip all of my friend wants to know how I was getting this much good deals and I told them about this website and now all of them are still using it to book hotels in their own countries. They still says how can one get a room in this much good hotel for this cheap.  This was my experience with this website. Thanks for Reading.

1486,Well me and my friends were planning to go shimla Manali and Dharmshala on Sept this year and for that we booked all our hotels of the above destinations from MakemyTrip. The best thing about MakeMyTrip what we found that they provide us great discount in each and every hotel we have booked for our trip I searched many website for hotel booking at affordable rate but among all MakeMyTrip is the best and The best thing is their website where we found whole range of hotel of that particular place from cheaper range to higher range very categorical they have sub-assumed in their website which made us easy to find hotel in our budget we have booked Two Hotel in Shimla One Hotel in Manali one Hotel in Dharmshal and Two Hotel in Delhi and all cost us around 9000 for 12 days trip in total after booking all the hotel I called their customer care to reconfirmed whether I need to call all the hotels for my re confirmation but they simple ask me that same has been sent to respective hotel about my booking so I dont need to call again well its feel good that when all come in handy and you dont need to do things own your own beside that their service and support and very responsive which I found and most and fore most which I asked customer care agent about the cancellation policy they have cleared all my doubts about its how I get my refund and do I changed any thing for cancellation everything so hoping to have good service in my trip same as well from the hotel which I booked from MakeMyTrip,3

1488,Horrible experience with the travel website. They just cheat and harass. I booked a bus ticket on the website from Mumbai. I got the eticket with PNR number on my email. When I reached the bus pick up point with family and waited for 45 minutes the busoperator said there is no booking on my name. When called make my trip customer care he said to wait 24 hours to resolve my complaints when I was standing on road with my family. This absolutely cheating and harassment they are doing to customers to make money. Don't relie on them and don't do the booking.,1
1489,"It only gives the information of lots of flights, but I don't feel its better to book. Few points for booking: 2.Frequently it changes its price, makes confusing. 3.Improper/fake offers given: I got a offer with HDFC credit card for using first time but it never refunded any amount, though I was having scrren-shot after applying the code successfully. I  called customer care but not resolved. Service is too bad, they used to close your complain without informing. Main point: when you check price will be bit less but while booking it gets increased lo ike anything. I hate this when I saw a message poping out as the cost increases due to most filling seats. 6.huge price difference while final booking. Most of the times MMT increase its price while you are about to pay, reason is they have limited seats on a particular sector for low fares. Never check multiple times for a same flight ticket, mmt used to increase the price based on visit. I want to suggest people to book tickets directly from the airlines websites it will never cheats you.",1

1493,"My family members like traveling a lot. So, we always need a helping hand as to where to book the tickets from. MakeMyTrip offers an easy and cheap way to book flight tickets for any place you might want to go. The things I like about MakeMyTrip are: It is a fast accessible website which is user-friendly and easy to use. The website also loads at a pretty fast speed. The prices available on this website is way cheaper than any other flight booking website. I booked a ticket from Delhi to Ranchi in just Rs. 1800, which is far less compared to any other website as I compared it with many of them. You can book tickets 5-6 months ahead of the present time, and check the website daily as the prices fall down greatly on some special days. In addition to flights, you can also book hotels, buses, cabs, and trains at a pretty cheap price and exciting offers. The service and support provided by the website are also very nice. The company will reply you immediately if you have any queries related to the website. So guys, next time when you plan a journey, make sure that you book your tickets from MakeMyTrip.",4

1495,"I made this booking and have this very strong feedback for makemytrip and the hotel which is plain cheating: At the time of the booking on the initial screen on mobile the hotel price was much lower but the actual charge was much higher by as much as think 1500Rs if I remember right. This is plain cheating where you promise something and charge something at the final payment page. Most people won’t notice that. I specifically made a room with breakfast booking but between makemytrip and lemon tree they said it is a room only booking. I was better off booking some other hotel using some other portal than the cheats at makemytrip and lemon tree. The hotel staff was non courteous and unhelpful. It is as if they are fully trained for the cheating modus operandi and didn’t care much. The hotel itself is undeserving of a Lemon Tree brand. There is hardly parking, the room floors have shopping areas on the left side of the lift lobby. It is as if you are staying in a railway station with all sort of crowd and hangovers loitering around even at mid night. The hotel has no driver room / amentias for drivers for a touristy place Jaipur. Glad I had booked only for the night and got out of the makemytrip / Lemon Tree cheating trap the next day. Promptly moved to another better hotel that I checked out first instead of going by the rosy pictures and review at makemytrip that for the most part are managed. Sad that portals have been taken over by these slick gimmick and cheats.",1
1496,"I have done bookings in the past, which was fine, then I started doing tour bookings and experienced horrible service, worst ever trip, so I stopped doing booking. After long time I did a tour booking with them and got a good and decent booking done. Now I did flight bookings and I do get points added, no rewards, and on top of it I get the customer care calling me and bring rude with me over the phone and hanging up. Horrible customer care. I explained more than 10 times that I have not received credit of points and rewards, but they say I received which they show for a years back booking. The company is horrible in service, as they have mass bookings and make the money, they dont at all care about service. It is a clear sign of cheating customers, now its been almost a month, and yet not received any update, they only say we are doing it, but no updates at all. One of the biggest cheat in the hospitality industry. No response yet from the customer care, from here or anywhere else.",1
1497,"I was looking to book a hotel Dona Julia Goa from 18th July for 2 night 4 pax. Checked the price of standard room which was showing 910 per room. So for 2 nights should be 1820 and for 2 rooms should be 3640. Whereas on next page when I proceeded with the booking it gave me the price of 5824 out of nowhere+ 416 MMT service charge. When I had a chat with the advisor online he didnt understand my query. When I called up service team, the guy I spoke to said hotel has increased the price and they have added the taxes and asked me to check with the hotel once I reach the hotel about the break down of the cost and still if you do not get the answer get back to us. That's what I did at the first place, when i'm booking hotel from MMT they should be having the answer about the taxes the hotels are charging. On chat asked  the advisor to transfer the chat to Manager 6 times he didn't do that nor helped me with his managers email address when asked for.  My question is simple. I dont mind paying 10000 also but I need a complete break down on the price and taxes charged by hotel or MMT. And I never got the answer for it. Still I had no option and had to book the hotel. Just hoping my trip will not be spoiled as the start is this.:(",1
1498,"Horrible company, pathetic management, biggest frauds in its sector, mmt has failed badly this time. I want to file a consumer case for these reasons- Using my money and not giving e ticket for 18 days. Cancelling my ticket without my permission Lying about comments done on calls. Not standing by to the commitments done. Deleting call records that were in the favour of customer. Cheating customer by dragging the case everyday by saying 24 hours, 48 hours etc. And not solving it ever. Delay in refunds. Worst management ever.",1
1499,"My ticket was cancelled itself without prior notice. Here are the details:- This is in regard to booking id- NF2263194459133 The ticket was booked in the name of Divya Garg, which got rescheduled and informed I would like to bring it to your notice that my office meeting was scheduled at 1030 hrs on 30 June and another meeting at 1400h on the same day. When I reached at around 0515 hrs the Indigo counter I was informed that my booking is invalid and fresh booking is required. To my shock,  It was very unprofessional and callous behaviour from a reputed firm like MMT that no advance intimation was given. In view of the same I was forced to make a fresh booking at the airport ticket counter to reach Chennai at the earliest. Moreover, after my efforts the earliest ticket available was departing from Delhi at 1100 hrs. Because of this mismanagement at MakeMyTrip end I was put in a embarassing situation in front of my clients. Owing to the same I had to incurr a loss in my reputation, time and money. Following are the details of the damages caused by the lack of professionalism displayed by your team: On the spot flight booking- Rs. 10370( copy enclosed) Meal charges- Rs. 700. Defaming and inconvenience charges- Rs. 10000. Its been 7 days to this matter and there is no solution to the situation and its more than 4 days there no concrete answer to my mail. Another example of lack of professionalism from your end. I would not recommend to anyone to book via MMT. It had really given me bitter experience. There are definately other better portal available.",1

1501,Never go through MakeMyTrip for your flight booking. There are so many hidden charges and Panalties while cancelling or rescheduling your flight. Lots of problems I have faced.  Automatically my hotel room was cancelled without any reasons. I have spoken to cc but no use really I am very disappointed this like behave . I booked a flight tickets on 22th June 2016 but I tried to cancel my tickets due to some reasons but they are not cancelled my tickets and they are provide a link which had received not responding. I am really fed up. VERY BAD EXPERIENCE WITH MAKEMYTRIP SITES SO MANY PROBLEMS IN THIS SITES. THANK YOU,1
1502,"Highly disappointed  with the service. Pathetic experience. I was booking hotel Deccan Serai, Hyderabad. On the front page it shows cost Rs 2419/ night per room. Just then I downloaded the MMT app with a referral code which gave Rs 1200 in my MMT wallet. Then I opened the same hotel - front page it shows same cost(Rs 2419/ night per room). Then when I clicked “book now”, price increased to Rs 3410 (how?) and wallet money deducted 800(now it was Rs 400 left after deducting Rs 800 from Rs 1200) and there was one code which I applied to get Rs 300 discount(on applying this coupon code it showed code applied successfully) but I was charged Rs 3500 finally(again how?) . On the fare details page I was shown hotel cost Rs 3281(even after applying Rs 300 coupon code) and MMT charges Rs 219. Since it was necessary to book a room in that hotel, so inspite of this I booked a room and just after the booking, when I viewed the same hotel again this time final total charge was Rs 2899(with no coupon code and wallet money not being used). Seriously MMT thinks customers are fool? Lots of hidden charges. No transparency in fare details. MMT now just wants to make money and nothing else. I raised a complaint for the issue, no response, escalated the compaint still, no contact nothing. When I tried calling for that issue they would always say all our members are busy. But the same time I called for a flight booking issue, member available(how?) I mailed also many times still no response. That is very disappointing from such a company. Would never use that app again nor would recommend anyone. I have given so much time to write this complain on quora so that atleast people will read and know how badly MMT  treats some issues. I feel cheated and wasted my money. The wallet money and coupon codes are extremely fraud. They are now on a money making business.",1
1503,"App which they developed is very buggy(faulty) and I have to pay more money cause of there messi app. there no option to negative otherwise I will give -5. And after searching other option found that we will get more discounted packages. Never use this app for bookings it wrost you will frustrate once you do any booking, you can not find your bookings in your trips section. cleartrip, yatra or other local service providers are best than this app. Others never gives false commitment. and customer care is very worst they only make you fool every time you need to explain all situation to all executive. after 5 days conversation(every time I called them) I finally feel that they are only doing drama nothing else and for cancel package now I am bearing 35% of total package(which is around 15000 to 16000) and it high for me. instead good and discounted package I got loss and frustration. Now uninstalling app for self satisfaction I can not do anything other.   Celebrity like Ranveer and aliya should not promote fraud company like MMT. #Thiefmytrip #MakeMeTemper",1
1504,I booked a flight from make my trip for 13th aug'17. But I got a msg ticket showed for 8th aug'17.

When I got the msg I called MMT customer care they said you have 30min you again book your 5 tickets which cost 30k n we will charge 1800rs and refund your remaing amount how can you give such bullshit offer and what is the surity they will refund my money back. they are not ready to accpt thre mistake and they are even saying that we can see in our system you didnt even search any flight for 13th aug'17.

Getting discounts in real is not possible for flights and for hotels too but with makemytrip we get gift vouchers to get cashback or offers which are better than other online or offline travel agencies, The only thing makemytrip should improve is their customer service which is the blunder and they hardly attend calls once I had to wait 30 minutes to get connected with customer support, but I ignored due to their other services. They must improve onlt this part nothing else.",4

Never knew that MakemyTrip works in this fashion.  This will be my first and the last booking through MakemyTrip. Do not advice to book flights though MakemyTrip. Bijesh,1
1507,"Makemytrip is very useful website. Makemytrip.com app availabel in android and ios. It is very useful for travelling. In this website book travel ticket like bus, railways, flights. In this also book Hotel room. This is very useful website for booking. This website service is very good and secure.",5
1508,This is my good experience with make my trip they r the best service provider in the market. I travell every time with makemytrip booking. It is bus or train they provide satisfied service. When I was travelled from belgaum to udupi the ticket price with insurance was 665/- rupees I had bonus signup balance and referal bonus 1200/ u can use only 10% of ur bonus for every boking thus I got 60/ rupees off and I applied 'busmob' promo code which got me 120 rupees off. In 485/- rupees I have travelled. Now every booking I getting such offers. Customer support is very nice best to go with make my trip,4
1509,"NH7106441850330  is the booking ID for Jaipur made via MMT I had made a booking for Jaipur in January 2017, since I had already landed in Jaipur I had to book a hotel. Now there were many options from the local to other Travel website but I choose MMT When I searched for MMT assured hotels I found Hotel Rockland and restaurant which is close to Riddhi Siddhi and may say approx 18km away from the Jaipur station. Well the Room that was allotted to me was in the ground, they said all other rooms were full hmmm I took that with a pinch of salt. The room did not had any ventilation and AC was working alrite not like an experience. When asked about the site seeing arrangement, they suggested me OLA. Hotel in a place like Jaipur is suggesting OLA now that is not a good service - Ofcourse they could have give me more options Now come the height of them all . I ordered a Chicken Dish some rotis rice and we were a couple, in the morning when room service gave me the bill I was shocked Shocked, yes I typed that twice. Chicked dish costed me 1200/ when I questioned they said I had ordered it has full and not half. Now I dont understand why would  I order full for two people and also it was inhouse restaurant they know this particular room is occupied with only two people. Now whenever  you make a booking from MMT assured hotels make sure they provide free breakast which I assumed as most of the Travel website do provide free breakfast MMT do not Photos shows about the Rockland and restaurant is false, they was no resto bar in the hotel MMT has rated this hotel very high so I am bit surprised do we all belong to the same planet cause I had the weirdest of experience. I had reviewed the same Hotel on the official website about the hotel, there is no courtesy email or call BAD very Bad So Friends, please make sure you check and confirm the details when you make a booking via MMT On that note Raga Signing off",1
1510,"Booking ID NN7302718573162 I had completed my onward flight and wanted to prepone my return flight, the app showed a refund amount of 42k while the ticket was 58k. I called the agent asked for the charges to prepone, and got a reply saying 28k plus price difference. Then I asked if the amount(42k) reflected in the app is genuine even after flying the onward flight and I was told it was genuine and the same amount will be refunded. I ended the conversation by saying I will go with cancelling through the app. I cancelled my flight on 3rd june The refund was supposed to reach my account in 6-7 days which didn't happen. when I called to check the progress I was told the amount was not genuine and I'll get around 13k of refund. I raised the issue to the supervisor(spoken to around 2 or 3 of them) and was told I'll get the amount that was promised after validating the calls. I was told the issue will be resolved in 48hrs which then went to 24hrs and still goes on with 24hrs every time I call. It's been 15 days since I cancelled my flight,  12 days since I'm calling for the progress and all I hear is wait for 24hrs, 24hrs and another 24hrs until 18th June. Really horrbile service. Fake promises. Totally fed up calling everyday. Frustration is reaching limits Can someone tell me how many more 24hrs will I have to wait. Update: 19th june The supervisor I spoke to says I won't get any refund and I will owe 2k as the onward fare charges were 61k and the validating team has refused to pay up the amount promised i.e 42k. Now what should I do. Firstly the team is making fake promises. Secondly they are not consistent on the refund amount which changes every now and then. This is makemytrip which can also be termed as fakemytrip. Never believe these fakers",1
1511,Would like to thank customer support team for helping me to get in touch with my relative who were in thailand few days before. I was unable to contact them but mmt support team helped me out to contact them. However could you guys plz minimize the ans time from 20 minutes to 10 min.20 min is irritating.but overall im happy with the service provided by the team.thanks,5
1512,"Harassing Customer - No Clear Policy, worst service and full of Technical Issues Customers - Please do not book Hotel Summit Swiss Heritage Hotel, Darjeeling or any Hotel of Hotel Summit Swiss Heritage Hotel(specially with Make My Trip). Worst Service, No clear Policy. If you Booked then your money will be captured. You have to Stay or loose your Many in any Case. There is no clear policy of Make My trip and corresponding Hotel Summit Swiss Heritage Hotel. When I was booked the hotel on 05-May-2017, at the time of booking the MakeMyTrip App was displaying ""Free Cancellation before 23-Jun-2017 12:00 PM IST"". But we received the Voucher with 15 days before cancellation policy however, I have to stay and already planned to visit Darjeeling so it did not matter for me. But now policy has again changed/displaying that the Hotel is again available with ""Free Cancellation before 23-Jun-2017 12:00 PM IST"" but in my case it is 15 days. If Hotel's has 15 days cancellation policy then how can MMT displaying or given only 3 days Cancellation Policy on 16/17/18-Jun-2017? So there is no synchronization between Hotel and MMT. As Television is broadcasting and it is already in News that since last 7-8 days(on 18-Ju-2017) Darjeeling situation is very Bad and dangerous for visitor. So other customers and Hotels are cancelling their Booking. But here MakeMyTrip and Hotel - Summit Swiss Heritage Hotel both are harassing me and both are transferring their responsibilities upon each other. MMT saying there is no update and cancellation/refund will depend upon Hotel and Hotel saying the all responsibilities are for MMT. I am continuously in touch with MMT(Hotel was not picking up call on all 3 numbers mentioned on Voucher and Internet). MMT has no information about Darjeeling Issue and asking me to wait till 18 then 19 and then 24-Jun. No body carrying here for Customer, customer life is not important for MMT and Hotel both. Both are caring only about the money which they already stolen from customer on false cancellation policy or Issue in MMT Website/Technical Problem on APP. Now, I do not have much time to waste(already wasted approximately 3 Hours on Phone). Please keep my Money with you. I do not want to go with MMT and Hotel. And wanted to other customer to be aware and do not book anything from MMT. There is no authenticity and Moral. Just for making money and harass customer. Worst service.

1515,"I will never book my flights with the website any more. Search page showed price as Rs1250. with in couple minutes by the time I confirmed my ticket it went upto Rs 2465 and the reason they gave is that I should have watched the change in the price carefully in every page while booking. Well lesson learnt at a good cost. Customer service worst - Within seconds I reached out to them to help me cancel the booking and they simply cant help as its my mistake. To crosscheck where it all went wrong - I went back to the search again and saw the price is indeed changed. Now when I try to book(just after 10mins after my first booking) the grand total is only Rs 1890. Was soo unlucky in gambling in this site as the prices change every sec and it happens that in the whole day only the time I actually booked was the worst price timing. And there is no way they will either match the present price nor help me cancel. Well again they somehow can do all that if I pay rs 225 for ""Zero cancellation"" during my original booking. The customer service conversation was so reckless that you feel like a cheap customer after paying double the amount to what you paid. Thanks MakeMyTrip. I will never need your service again. Your service is not as sweet as your commercial Ads. Wish you are spending more money on customer service than on Ads.",1

1517,"It is an app , which I have been using from a long time and belive me its not at all good . Compayering to other apps it does not stand any way near. Though it gives a lot of offers and stuff but does not a very use full one. Tickets are way more expensive then other sites or apps . Hotels are very expensive almost double the prise of original hotels . As I visited my local hotels which was near by . Prices in real are less but in makemytrip it is just the double. Recently app reveled their refer and earn process and they where giving like 600 INR to 2200 INR  for attracting more people to come but it was also use less it the money in your make my trip wallet can't pay  the full amount . You can only pay 5% - 10% of the the total amount . And even the with the high prices you must have to think twice if you are a person like me. The way it( app) looks is pretty cool but looks does not matters when the purpose of the app does not full fill . May this information helps you . Thank you",2
1518,"This review is just to inform about the actual service of make my trip gift cards. Yes I was glad to recieve a make my trip gift card worth Rs.2000 from one of my friends. He just informed me that it would definitely assist me during my upcoming trip to Secunderabad. So, soon after I got to recieve his giftcard, I was pretty glad that, I would get a to and fro bus ticket from Vizag. Then comes in the actual surprise with all the shitty terms and conditions which says -it can only be redeemed after three days of purchase and the most important one was that they don't allow to get the money in the gift card credited in the make my trip wallet. Only  flight tickets and hotel bookings can be done through that gift card where no on-going offers will be applicable if we decide to make use of the full-fletched gift card. This is yet another shock for me and for a person like me who never travels in air and never need to stay at a hotel outskirts, what's the use of having a gift card when there's no chance of purchasing bus or train tickets. The value of money will be same right? Then why doesn't make my trip allows the user to access also the bus and train tickets through the redemption of gift card. Dear company Please go through my review and kindly take a look over it. I would be pretty happy if the money could be added in the MMT wallet. Also I do find the prices of buses a bit high when compared to redbus.com",2

1522,"We paid extra to book refundable and flexible tickets. As we could not make it to the city of departure during the return journey, I tried to cancel or modify the tickets as it is mentioned can be done till the 0 hour of departure. When I called makemytrip, the agents were not even aware of what was mentioned on their website and refused to change or cancel them, as it was less than 24 hours before the flight would take off where as it's clearly mentioned that till the 0 hour I could modify them will a nominal charge. They kept making excuses after excuses and told me I need to wait for a week if I want to go back to India with the same tickets. Being left helpless in another country, after being on call with them for 7 hours that night, I had to book another ticket to come home. Since then, I've been calling them everyday but all they do is keep transferring the call from one person to another . Now they say I cancelled the ticket after the flight took off which is a lie, they are looking at IST whereas the flight was in east European time. A travel portal to make a mistake like this is a joke! I'm not going to let this go. You'll have harassed us enough. I also have a voice recording of one of their managers admitting its their fault. Consumers wake up and avoid this company which makes promises they can't keep and then keep lying so they don't have to give you your money back.

1526,I was fan of OYO room mobile app and I thought that MakeMyTrip are just spending money on marketing using Alia Bhatt and Ranveer Singh and many more. But I have faced poor service and too high priced hotel rooms while booking with OYO rooms and I start using MakeMytrip app. I have found out that I can get cheap price hotels using it compare to other app. You can really find cheap hotel. but always compare it with other apps. which is really hard to do. but do that.,3

1530,I would like to share my view on Make my Trip Phone App. In my opinion its one of the most user friendly phone app I have come across. I wanted to book hotel for my solo trip to Igatpuri and I was very much confused with so many online portals and giving various discount and offers. I have actually sat and compared the cost of various hotels on different portals and what I observed is the cost showing on MMT is the cheapest of all. Finally I decided to download the application on my handset and I was very happy with the information and the various offers they were providing making it worth our time. So the time what we are spending is not a waste. I have got various hotels at the 50 percent cost along with cash back in my MMT Wallet which I can use the next time I do the booking. I am very satisfied with the app and I would recommend it to any one and every one. Thank you Sharda Dubey,5
1531,"MakeMyTrip(MMT) team was extremely helpful! I have always used MMT for booking my tickets and I had no issues at all. However this time something went wrong while the name was being entered on the ticket. I entered my surname wrongly while booking the ticket. I booked my flight with Jet airways and the airlines refused to make any changes to in their system, which meant that my ticket would go to waste and they asked me to book another ticket. Through this entire process MMT had been trying to pursue Jet to make the changes since it was a typing error but Jet airways did not budge. I had almost given up hopes, but MMT team did a brilliant job in following up my case with Jet airways. Within 42 hours they somehow convinced the airline company to make the changes and got me the same flight! I'd especially like to thank Bhavna Tiwari and Deepjay Patel who were so very helpful through this! Thank you so much guys! I really appreciate your efforts! Keep up the outstanding customer service! Like I mentioned you guys have won me as a life long customer!:)",5

I waited for 30mts, called back, Other person took the call and asked me what my complaint is?.i told her too about the problem and then she asked me to wait for 30mts. I waited 1hr. Called back. Then 2 times my call was purposefully hanged after confirming my no:.then Ms.Swehal attended the call, she finaly gave me another option, when I was to confirm the call got disconnected.after that I called same happened he who took the call disconnected.then again called back, then Mr.Ravi took the call and he too started saying that I have to the confirmation from the hotel which we have booked that its sold out!, crap. Then I again told the whole story and he told that there are lots of formality so will call back tommorrow 10am. I am really feeling hopeless. And pathetic that I booked through make my trip!

1536,"We booked a resort - Recluse Resort(or whatever you want to call it as it wasn't even close) in Coorg for long weekend in May'17. We were family of 6 with senior citizen parents, and one 3 year old kid. On reaching the place, the Hotelier Punit completely refused to give the rooms even after showing CONFIRMED MMT hotel vouchers and we had spent as much as Rs 30000/- for two days for two AC rooms. The hotel guy said he blocked all rooms on 21Apr only, and still the booking was available in MMT website on 24Apr. On the same day, we made several calls to MMT but of no use(everytime they said some concerned person will get back in 15 min but nothing happened). Our whole trip was wasted and MMT didn't make any attempt to resolve the issue. Worst part is, we are till date struggling to get refunds for the rooms and in the calls, MMT agents ganged up and advocated for the Hotelier! So, people take a lesson and pedge never to use MMT for any booking as it is an unprofessional and FRAUD company. Readers, please don't go for the 4 or 5 star ratings of MMT here as most of them look fake. Mouthshut and readers both should look for booking ids and identify genuine reviews.",1

It also provides feasible options ( calander chart) for cheaper combination of dates. 2-3 times I didnt got cash backs in my MMT wallet. I contacted them. they were very supportive and they transferred the cash back fo my bank account in 2 -3 days instead of MMT wallet. And it also offers customised packages. in that you can add or remove destinations or you can give name of the destination and than they will make itinerary for you.i really like this app.,5

1543,"I have come back today after Guwahati-Shillong-Cherrapunji trip. It was a disturbing trip from date of booking(NL 20834457236). Mr Hardik(Hardik.Utwani@makemytrip.com) helped me in booking process. After booking I used to get a mail and SMS everyday regarding confirmation of my home pickup address. I informed Hardik about it by mail. He advised me to ignore. Surprisingly, after indefinite number mail and SMS there was no home pick up cab for us. I informed Hardik again before starting my journey without any reply and I arranged my own There is very poor planning from your team regarding Shillong sightseeing. How could you miss Elephant falls, live root bridge, cleanliest village of Asia( Mawlynnong)? We gave our driver additional Rs 5k to cover that. You enlisted  some unimportant places and missed the best one. The biggest disaster was at Cherrapunji. We had a booking at Kutmadan resort. It was located out of locality nearing Bangladesh border. There was no other buildings apart from this resort. When we reached there, we came to know that there was no electricity! It was completely dark.We could not find any other guests. It was so unsafe to stay in absolutely dark lonely place with my wife! And there was no mobile connection also. Hotel authority said that their generator was not functioning and no nhassurance of electricity! Hotel team was really reluctant to our queries. I immediately came back to town and called Hardik(my contact person) . He asked me wait for 2hr(6pm -8pm) and wait for their reply . He assured us that he had already informed the involved authority. But there was no call from MMT team. In the meantime, I arranged a separate hotel on my own and then called MMT . After 15 minutes MMT team( Hemant.raina@makemytrip.com) called me back  and assured to reimburse the bill and it is still pending. You are basically useless in emergency! I have to arrange my own! I have also travelled to Kashmir and Bhutan through MMT. Always there was a local contact person to help. There was none for this trip! Now you tell me who is responsible? Is it Hardik for his poor trip mAnasultangement or the whole MMT team? You presented us a disturbing painful holiday.",3

When I called at 9 this morning, Jet airways said very clearly that all I had to pay is close to 18k for 5 passengers if they had to rebook the tickets for the 8 pm Flight. I had to call multiple times to Mr.Devender and only to hear back from him that he had to wait to hear back from the airlines booking team. BY the time, I heard back from his manager at 12 noon, the cost went up and ended up requesting my relatives to book a fresh tickets from delhi to Chennai that costed us 50k. Just because, I trusted you guys, I had to pay 50k… If I had done  booking myself, I should have used a common sense to have a good break in delhi knowing that the Jet flies from a different terminal. I also requested on April 4th to see on why makemytrip booked tickets for my relatives with a very short break.( please refer my email dated April 4th). Makemytrip folks blindly said that they couldn’t get any availability on other flights.It is so funny that my relatives took the spice jet flight at delhi( 235 pm) which I would suppose makemytrip should have booked at the first instance. Why one would book the connecting flight from Jet when you are fying from srinanagar to delhi in Spicejet? These are the things Makemytrip should have considered while making booking for me. I have no idea on why you guys booked at Jet when there is a spicejet flight available at 2:35. I want to bring to your notice that I was totally upset with the response that I receieved from Devender this morning…Inspite of me calling multiple times from the airport, all I heard from him was just absurd responses…I was expecting makemytip reps to give me confidence rather they were very arrogant today. This is unacceptable after paying 3.5 lacs for a trip. Actually, me, my wife and my kids are good with flying back to Hyderabad but it was for my in-laws who are aged and their grand children who are 4 and 9 years repectively who are stranded at the Srinagar airport with no clue since all the booking was done through me. I lost complete trust from my in-laws and it was shame for me to leave the young kids stranded in the airport for hours together. If I had not spoken to you guys, I could have managed talking to the airlines and made the rebooking with less penalty…but I trusted you guys and it not only costed me 50k but also I lost trust from my family who insisted me to go through cox and kings but I made them to go for makemytrip. I have made many travels myself but never been ditched like this before.Please dont do any booking with makemytrip",1

I personally use this app to book flight tickets, bus tickets, train tickets, hotels or holiday packages with good offers. Makemytrip is more useful for frequent travelers where all bookings can just be done on a single click. But now a days lots of advertisement pop ups are appearing which is bit annoying along with what I have noticed that if someone books hotel for 3 nights then he has some restrictions over discount and and same is eligible when he is doing 3 separate bookings. The real time seat availability should also be improved. Otherwise I am quite satisfy with the service. They always send the PNR numbers on time just before departure of the booked Flight, train or bus. Give it a try, it's a complete tour guide with exciting offers.",3

1550,Pathetic and Completely unexpected behaviour:  I booked a flight through MakeMyTrip(IXJ-DEL) today for a SpiceJet flight timing @ 3:45 pm. However once I made aishwaryasingh23ment; I got a confirmation and e-ticket for 1:15 pm flight instead of the one I booked. Both the flights have some fare though.  I immediately called MakeMyTrip customer within less than 5 minutes of booking to report the issue and to my surprise I was asked that MakeMyTrip has logs to confirm that I booked for 1:15 pm as if I was doing for the first time and asked that it was my mistake. I reassured/confirmed person that I did select 3:45 pm flight and both flights even had same cost and even cross checked before moving to aishwaryasingh23ment page. I even highlighted that it could be system bug but the customer care agent had exceptional customer service skills and company values to hold me wrong again and ask that I need to aishwaryasingh23 additional money if I need to get onto that flight since fare has gone up by that amount. When I spoke to Airline; they specified that I need to talk to MakeMyTrip since I've booked through them and prize of flight have gone up. I am somehow not happy with the practice MakeMyTrip & Airlines is following without realizing; how bad customer experience it leaves with the person. I was surprisingly left with no option than to hung up the call after 30 mins or so. I'm completely disappointed with this instance and feel like cheated by MakeMyTrip and Airlines without accepting that it could also be application bug or may be airlines cost for 3:45 pm flight was bumped up during booking and post getting the aishwaryasingh23ment I was put on 1:15 pm with same cost. Somehow both the parties were not willing accept this and asking for more money towards difference of fare to offer me the option that I actually opted for. I would never do any business with MakeMyTrip and SpiceJet here on and want to highlight this issue to others as well.,1

1559,Booking I'd - IN1607B4S1193828 Last year I booked Karla trip with them. Every thing was fine until last day but last day when we reached airport to go back we come to know that the ticket is cancelled because the airlines stopped their services. These people did not know the ticket was cancelled. After hours of call(that keep passing the ball to different teams) they said that you go by bus and we will reimburse everting. After that we somehow got bus and reached Bangalore. It was horrible night. Later when I sent them bus tickets for reimbursement they simply denied by keeping blame on airlines. Not given me back single money. That was pathetic. I lost almost 11000/- including airfare. I suggest don't go for it because if something goes wrong they will never help.,1
1560,"Heyy Guys, Today I'm sharing my experience which I have done in the previous year with MakeMyTrip. MakeMyTrip is the only one which is good for tours. If you have a plan to go anywhere and your friends are agree with you then you can go to the member of MakeMyTrip. They will tell about your tour where you want to go like Manali, Nainital, Mclodganj, Or any Holy place. They will help you by tell you something about that place. They also provide to go with you on your tour. They booked hotels or fooding restuarents or anything else by their own but they charges some money according to the fooding or restuarent. They booked the best. Service of MakeMyTrip peoples is very good to talk. When you trying to open the site it takes several seconds.

1561,"Booking ID: NN7301818790724 After being disappointed twice, i'd highly suggest not using makemytrip ever if you want to plan a peaceful vacation. It's a pathetic website with whole lot of crap and bad mathematics solely with the intention of CHEATING customers Booked a family flight ticket to DXB and the total on the page after discounts and partial payments showed up as 37000. Got an email from MMT confirming the same with a link to balance payment. Clicking on link the next day shows that we owe 39000 instead of previous confirmed amount. This is also the last day before the tickets will get auto-cancelled and customer care has no damn clue of what happened. they have to check with other dept to get back to me and can't tell me if this ticket will be good till THEY get back to me. inspite of their confirmation email, the lady from customer service is reading terms fineprint that was never shown and enforced on the website, that the discount is not applicable if there's netbanking payment. can't website enforce this if it's the case?",1

1564,"I booked my trip with mmt around year back, for ooty, mysore, coorg.  I joined the trip as well, But when I reached first destination i.e. Mysore, my wife could not cope with weather there, and we had to abort the trip and return back home. MMT advertises and encourages full refund for ppl who in advance pay money to them, In case of cancellation because of medical or any other emergencies. But In my case, these guys just paid mere 7.5 k back, and rest money they shamelessly said can't refund. Another strange thing I found is, they don't have any strict policy behind, making booking or making refunds, it just upto the person serving the request.  Anybody who is going to use MMT for future trips, please beware and don't pay anything in advance, they ll rob you .",1
1565,They are horrible. Thet almost ruined my trip to leh. As soon as the Leh trip start date came they told me I have to book my own flight till Delhi and I paid them for the entire package which includes flight to Delhi. The team were not responsive. I had to threaten them to take the matters to the court  n then they confirmed by booking just one day before. They spoiled the mood. Not trust worthy.,1
1566,"Our tour to Srilanka was for five nights and six days, arranged through Make my Trip, Chennai office. The MMT  executives, particularly Mr. Syed  were very nice and responsive. After noting down my requirements-mainly to visit Trincomalee temple-MMT suggested a package which included Dumbulla caves, Sigiriya Fort, Kandy Tooth temple and Colombo city. It was only a land package, ie, air tickets were booked by myself. We started on 22-03-17 early morning and returned on 27-03-17 night. First the plus points: All the four hotels booked by MMT  were excellent and worth the money.They were budget hotels, but perfect for night stays. Breakfast and dinner were included and hence no hassles on food. Three of the four hotels kept kettle and coffee/tea sachets in the room, which was a great help for people like us who are used to take coffee at odd times. Since only the two of us had booked on these days, a separate car-Nissan Bluebird- was provided with the chauffeur-cum- guide who could speak in English . He was always punctual and stuck to schedules.Smoothly drove on the decent roads of Srilanka, on all the six days. Enjoyed the visits to all the places given in the itinerary as per schedule.Pleasant overall. Now the few minus points; All the midway restaurants where the chauffeur  took us for lunch and tea, were quite expensive, by Indian standards. In one such restaurant, one litre of mineral water was charged 180SLR whereas it was available in all shops along the road for 40SLR. Just for two cups of tea, they charged us 500SLR, which shoud'nt have been more than 250 in any other decent hotel. The shops shown to us were also very expensive . also lot of bargaining was involved, which put us off. On our repeated insistence, he took us to the local market in Kandy which was quite lively and  cheap with plenty of varities.Unless you visit the local shops and markets, you will never get a feel of the country. Otherwise, all the star hotels and expensive shops are one and the same all over the world and nothing really Srilankan in them. The package included two nights stay at Kandy, which we felt was a waste of time. There is nothing much in Kandy which could'nt be covered in a day. The second night could have been booked at Yala or Galle and a trip via the picturesque Nuwaraelia and Kadhirkamam would have made it complete, though at some extra cost. When we tried to make the changes through the agent at Srilanka, he said that it was too late as they have to rebook the hotel and we have to forego the payments made to Kandy hotel. .This could have been avoided, if some flexibility had been built in, or atleast the local agent had discussed with us before finally booking the hotels.A little extra cost would have been perfectly OK for such a trip via Nuwaraelia. Few Tips: If one has limited time and want to cover all major attractions, MMT is a good option. Better discuss with their staff in detail  before finalising the plan. Also  do some research yourself   and make appropriate changes to their packages  suiting  your needs and tastes. MMT  packages offer both inclusive of air ticket as well as exclusive of it. I would suggest to book the air travel ourselves .There are  substantial variations in the  cost of airtickets from Chennai /India  depending on the days of travel Better to finalise the flight tickets before deciding on the exact dates of commencing the tour. If one is a budget traveller like us, better avoid the expensive restaurants which do not really worth the high cost. If someone is from Tamilnadu, better ask for a Tamil speaking driver.which will make communications comfortable. The entrance tickets to all the attractions are quite high.At most of the places, cards are not accepted. The best course would be to use the ATMs of major banks like Commercial Bank, which offer reasonable exchange rates. I feel about 40000SLR may be adequate for  lunches/tea, entry tickets to the attractions and some minor purchases for two persons in  a package of six days like ours.(ie, excluding the package cost paid in advance to MMT) It may be noted that entry rates for SAARC countries are roughly half of the rates applicable for other countries. At some places like Sigiriys fort, they wanted to see the original passport to give the discounts applicable for SAARC. If not passports, atleast carry some Govt. ID proof for verification at the ticket counters. Avoid talking politics . discuss everything else. Srilankans, in general, are very nice and helpful.",4
1567,"Would like to share my review about holiday package taken from makey trip. Had taken a package for Jodhpur Jaisalmer Bikaner. First Jaisalmer hotel Sanjay villas was given which was a third class hotel surrounded by local residence and dirty  outside, roaming pigs .It felt like living in a local mohalla.next in Sam dunes Iwas given li.ra camp which was disaster half of the camps were not there only  four five tents were there which were torn and in bad shape. Service was also vvey inferior . Bikaner same type. They charged a simple thali for as high as 600 rs and a bottle of water for 50/-. Actually I felt I was looted by make my trip. So I would advice or to go on such cheated online websites  .Instead go on your own. It would save some money and will get good choices o. The spot. When I personally inquired about hotels I was staying they were all below 1000-1500 per day . So please avoid MakeMyTrip  and go and explore on your own",1

1569,MAKEMYTRIP is one of the leading application for managing tour and travel right from right from your doorstep to the desired landmark.

In spite of having entered every detail correctly, the data went wrong to the airlines which is the mistake of make my trip.

1577,"Hi I am using make my trip for 3-4 years for now and till date I haven't received any offer which stands up to its words. Every time there is some hidden meaning in thier offers. Recently I have booked a ticket from pune to delhi. According to their website when you refer your friend then both of you will get some discount  while booking a flight through MMT. It was not mentioned on the website that it will not be discount which can be directly used in the form of money but they will give you reward points while at the time of giving offer they have mentioned that you will get some amount of money in your account. Only  because of this offer I have taken so much pain of downloading the app and registering over it but in the end it was a complete waste of time. I have got only few rewards points and that too I can't use at a single transaction. Worst policy ever. I am really fed up of MMT. Moreover no one was listening to my concern when I raised it at their portal. Most of the time their customer care people were not aware of the current discount which are applicable so I have to explain the complete process to every single one of them. After a month of discussion they have closed the ticket with out even asking me whether I am satisfied with them or not, I am certainly not happy with their service. In the end it all boils down to when they have to take money from you then they will be like we are the best and please use our service we are giving this much discount and once the customer bought their service it is like they don't know you. Pathetic service. This is recent incident which I am sharing over mouthshut. Thank God some has started this kind of service where common people can speak their concerns and atleast will bring some loss to the business of the concern person. MMT sucks!",1
1578,"MMT is now filled with looters and deceivers. It is becoming a conmen company.  The modus operandi is they will book your ticket after gaining your money, later the flight gets cancelled because it wasn't really booked at all. then they will avoid giving the refund.  they will try to divert you here and there. Complaint against them has gone to the government and in fact several court cases are being lodged against them. Their MD avoids meeting the public complainants. I have lost around 20k, and other people I know similarly Please try to avoid MMTrip.   In fact Cleartrip is much better and very fast.  Try booking directly on airlines website.  Avoid Makemytrip at all costs because you can lose your hard earned money and peace of mind.",1

1580,"I am a member of Make my Trip(MMT) since Jan, 2011. I got an excellent service since then. In case of flight booking, hotel booking whatever else s I blindly believed MMT. But recently I don't know what is happening with this company. I booked a Kashmir package ""Charismatic Kashmir with Gulmarg 6 nights"". After booking transaction some Error was showed. Around Rs. 70000/- was debited from my bank account, but booking was not confirmed. After a number of phone call I did to MMT call center, they were unable to trace my problem. At last 2 days before my leave started I have to go personally to MMT office in Ernakulam, Kerala. They took my reference number and assure me it would take at least 2 weeks to get back that payment to my Bank account. Then I had to book another same package for another Rs. 70,000/- approximately. I requested them that it will create financial problem at Kashmir. They told they were unable to do any alternatives. After reaching Srinagar, as per schedule station pick up and drop to House boat(as I booked for Houseboat with extra pay for 01 night) was there. But I  had to arranged my own. When I contacted MMT customer care they gave me some Local number which was not reachable. My full day enjoyment, all in went in vein. In J&K all post paid sim was not allowed. It was very difficult to call my driver. MMT Ernakulam also replied they couldn't do anything. Seeing me in a great depression in Houseboat, Boat owner helped me to trace MMT local office mobile number and arrange vehicle as per my package. The next day when a permanent driver came to me, he replied he was not been given for any plan. After reaching Pahalgaon as per Package there was no booking for hotel. It took 2 to 3 hours communication from different MMT office. I became very angry after seeing this type of service. It was really pathetic. At the last of my travel, I was not happy with the behavior of driver also. Driver was purely local and serve with MMT but always talking against MMT. I think MMT management is mainly responsible. They don't have the idea of itinerary, time scheduling, planning in advance, tour structure. For the first time I planned a tour with MMT, and I think this is the last. Anyway I think MMT is perfect and limited to only for flight and hotel booking. Thanks",3

1582,"Hi, I have booked a ticket from Kolkata to Bangalore but after making the payment, I discovered that the destination and boarding point has interchanged and even the departure date also have been changed .It has changed to 5th Mar instead of 7th March . Transaction ID:NF7264385847007 . I have booked a ticket for 7th March from MMT only. I hoped that they will detect and able to resolve the issue . But now they are telling that according to logs it is my fault . I have double checked my entry before proceed for booking . I am a regular traveler of MMT . but after this incident, I have lost my faith on MMT aap .  one of MMT associate has told me that they will come back on this issue but that didn't happened .",1
1583,The best part of service is you can quickly book the tickets .you can check all available hotels flights and bus. But for whenever you need a support you have to wait for more time sometimes call gets cut.you have to be patient. You money will deduct immediately after booking and if you cancel you have to wait for 7 working days. You have to keep on following until you get back your refund. Bonus point and offers are complicated. For example if you bonus of Rs 500 it doesn’t mean you have 500 off on you ticket. It’s just 10% of your 500 is Rs 50 only.And you need and in few offers you have to buy ticket of certain amount i.e. Rs 5000 and above. These all offers are sucks Best part you will get it all time and with commitments I like the app design and useful and easy to use. Best part is you can see prices difference according to days. Website load time It takes too much loading time in the beginning and booking process sucks.Takes more time than any other app or website.,3
1584,"I wish there is negative star rating. make my trip server is down for last 16 hours. by the time am writing review. rather than admitting they continue wasting customer time. I booked trip for my wife and daughter.  as per policy ticket was fully refundable and 450 detectable. travel plans changed within 12 hours and we tried to cancel ticket. booked on mid night 19 feb and try cancelling 20th evening. we booked online and tried cancel same way. website was down and continuously spinning in cancellation area. after hours of trying, I wont let us to go. next day I tried again and they ask for big cancellation fee. I was seriously, ending up calling customer service and after wasting hour, they did not admit their website was down and they are on fault. I had video of website down and cancellation area not working. but still it was our fault. customer service was rude. cant cancel online, then called them and they are not able to cancel and give me confirmation because their system is down. admit it man its your fault. over all experience was horrible.",1
1585,"My Air India flight AI771 from Kolkata to Bangalore got cancelled on 15th Feb by the Airlines. I had expected Makemytrip to process refund automatically when the flight was cancelled. But since no refund came, I had sent mail to MakeMyTrip for refund Reference id: 170218-000521. But now Makemytrip is saying that ""the airline is unable to provide us with the cancellation status over the phone(I wonder why?). Hence, we request you to provide us the stamped document with the applicable refund amount mentioned by them."" My question is why makemytrip is not e-mailing them and asking them for confirmation? And since the flight was cancelled by Airline, ain't I entitled for a full refund? Why they are asking me to go to all the way to the airport to collect some document? I am telling Makemytrip that I had recieved SMS from Airline regarding cancellation, but they will not accept that as valid(wonder why?). Since Bangalore Airport is far away from the city and the bus ride is not cheap(I will be spending a portion of the plane ticket here), I am requesting MMT to suggest something so that I do not have to travel to airport. I had great experience with MMT till now but this experience has effected my opinion about it.",3

This app is great as it provided me exact information about the availability of flight or anything which you wish to book your ticket through Make my trip. In Kolkata I booked a room using Make my trip. And I got my accommodation for 2 days very easily. I appreciate this app because it offers to saves some money through their discount on every ticket per person. Service and support is also good ad they provide you exact informartion. Now and my friends are planning to book our ticket through MMT offer Thailand in summer. Thus I prefer you to use MMT.",3

1592,"There have been many like me who have been booking hotels on MMT in pursuit of Pay at Checkout facility offered on the site. The site also says that there will be no penalty if you cancel a booking before a certain date. But then this statement is not true. I canceled just one booking where I went for Pay at Checkout and that too much before the deadline. However post that action of mine, I am being denied availing Pay at Checkout facility. It has been blocked and now I have to pay in advance. This has caused a lot of hassle and plus I believe this is cheating by a company of such repute. When you conceal certain things, it is not done. Moreover, this policy of MMT is ridiculous; its a joke since it can well happen that people have to cancel bookings on genuine grounds. If what has happened to me is not the penalty then what is the penalty? I am kept guessing by MMT!",2
1593,We have been using makemytrip for over a year and have been promised reward benefits. I can't begin to share the number of calls we have made and their customer service is awful. I am not exaggerating when I say that we have been put on hold for 30 to 40 minutes on each call we make. more often then not they hangup on you as they cant address the issue. when you ask for an escalation they promise a call back within 2 hours and of course its been 8 months and nothing yet. one of the most frustrating experiences of my life. the contact centre executives are just not capable of managing this situation and are really not interested. I was trying to book 6 international tickets but have now gone to yatra.com that offers better fares and rewards.,1

1597,"On Jan 18, 2017 I was comparing for a flight ticket for cok - dxb sector on omanair in their website and on MakeMyTrip.com. On Oman air site it was around 28000 for one adult and one child of 4 years. On make my trip it was 26000+. So I started completing the details in MakeMyTrip app and at final stage opted for "" complete by phone "" as I wanted to get window seat and to select my choice of meals. When I called MakeMyTrip, the agent picked the  call and started taking the details like my email ID and mobile no from which I was booking the ticket(through app). The agent kept on checking the flight and other details and then came online and asked me ""shall I proceed with booking."" I told yes and asked him to confirm the final price. He told me it's around rs 20000. I was surprised that I'm getting ticket at such a low rate. Then he said it's for one person. I asked what is total and he said it's 40000 rs. I mentioned to him it's showing 26000 rs in the MakeMyTrip app. He said the fare has increased suddenly and asked me to refresh the app to get the right price. I refreshed it and got price of rs 40000. I immediately understood that they have manipulated the data to my mobile phone to reflect the rate as the Oman air website was still showing rs 28000. I then told I do not want to proceeed and then booked ticket on omainair site for 28000 rs 1 adult plus a child. im a marketing consultant and am aware that it's possible to manipulate data to app if you know the phone details. Otherwise there is no way the price can suddenly jump 50% from market price. I'm sure they would be cheating many unsuspecting customers. MakeMyTrip surely cannot be trusted and as a company lacks in character. A company that survives on gimmicks only. I wish there was option for negative rating. My advise is to check always the price on several sites before you buy anything online. There are endless options to dupe you online if you are not vigilant.",1

Till date(7th Feb 2017) I haven't received the amount to my card and it is still lying in the wallet. There is a withdraw button in the wallet which returns an error. many calls and emails haven't resolved the situation as yet.

When I called them up immediately to correct it they refused to refund my ticket!  They said I just had to buy another one!  Any other airline or booking agency would correct such a mistake, because they are obligated by LAW to do so to make sure that mistakes like this are corrected!  But this one refused to!

I liked the services and facilities provided by MakeMyTrip.com and will surely book my travels here onwards! The mobile app of MMT has a good and informative interface, I recommend that they should increase the hotel details a bit because it would make it easier for the users to differentiate between the hotels easily and make a quicker decision. The offers and discounts of the website are real money savers but I found a fact that there is nothing too different in the offers sections than other sites like goibibo or yatra. Same price hotels and deals are also found there and also offline, so MMT should improve here to attract customers! Website and app usability is high and useful for quick travellers.

1624,"Dear Travelers if you are looking for a some roller coaster ride with awful surprises and disappointment  on a funfilled planned trip then opt for Makemy Trip. They wont let you down. I would like to share my experience about MM T in brief.  Me along with 4 of my friends had booked the package  tour to Thailand. Everything went fine till the payment was made but the itinerary was provided to us just 24hours before the departure with hardly any time left for us to plan anything for ourselves(That was a hint to my rest of trip). We  were supposed to check in at Pattaya Hotel at 6 AM as per the itinerary. We managed to get to the hotel only at 7.30 AM due to some delay in VISA processing. This was the best part, Once we arrived we came to know the Hotel was booked only from 12PM. All the excitement about Visiting a foreign country was crushed right there. What was MMT thinking their customers would from 6AM to 6PM?(Its too early to even for a sight seeing) . The travel agent did not pick our call either and we were just stranded for hours before we could receive any call from the travel agent. Upon receiving the call we realized that it was just a Ghost on a call because he was of no help and we ended spending our money to book a room until 12 PM. We were hoping for not to have any such ""Shocking"" surprise element Upon reaching Bangkok, However MakeMy Trip doesn't not fail to keep up its consistency in making things ugly. We got into a Hotel which was seriously with no windows. The rooms were not even the half of the Size of the rooms we stayed in Pattaya. The worst part was we had our rooms in the 6 floor which was NO SMOKING rooms. we did not want to dare the hotel authority coz having puff could make you cough 2000Bhats which 4000RS. We had to shuttle between the courtyard of the Hotel and our room to Smoke. Finally just when we had put up with enough of unpleasant stuff there was another surprise. We did not have baggage charges paid for us. Even if it was not part of the package at least they should informed us when had the briefing done by the Travel agent to all the MM T tourist in Bangkok. Makemy Trip never seized disappoint us in the entire trip with there carelessness. In spite of all these hassles we did have a good time(by doing things without MMT assistance), Thank you for that. Over all you did not MakeMy Trip. Hope to see improvements and pay attention to its customers. Giving 2 STARS as we reached home safe! Regards, Unhappy Customer",2

1630,"I didnt book any of my booking with Make my trip, But I must say they are the worst travel package provider. I requested for Himachal trip . they dont even customize the package all high rates with no logic. I also told them that I can cut few places from the itenary still they didnt change the price and they mentioned taxes have increased it will be now much costlier. We should stop seeing the make my trip ads on TV, 60% off and bla bla . all fake . its the most costlier web-site good for rich people like Malya . Yatra.com is the best provider . they know what is the meaning of customized package . I requested the make my trip people to include places which I want to visit which is possible from their end they mentioned but they didnt do that . I wanted to visit Delhi, Chandigarh, Shimla, manali and Amritsar . They didnt add Chandigarh in the itenary saying that you will face distance issues.Please include Dalhousie in your visiting plan . the agent itself is not understanding the meaning of customised package . they dont even revert back to our queries. I have to open multiple chats with them to get a response . they will give you few places to visit with costly hotels and less sight seeing places .Highly disappointing .This was the first time I wanted to book my package with Makemy Trip but thank god I didnt do this big mistake .",1

Now on my Andamans trip, one day before my trip starts I get a sms from spicejet that I need to pay extra for my luggage whereas such expenses should be covered under the entire payment done from my end. Even if I had to pay extra, their executives should inform us before booking such flight. Such nonsense management not expected from them. now when I am calling to answer and resolve my issue no one is bothered to resolve",1

They have website and app as well which is a great stuff. They are designed very well and easy to use. I love Make My Trip and recommend the same to everyone who is ever planing to make any kind of trip anywhere. For me, they are best and I only plan my trip with their assistance.",5
1637,"Andaman is a great place to visit but Makemytrip made it look the worst place ever. They have a worst support team. The tour manager they have looks so suspicious and sometime are very rude. The problem started in the first day itself. They gave us a worst hotel which they claim to be a 3 star property. All kind of illegal activities happen there and you can find bunch of guys boozing in every room. There where very little family. The guys in the next room where boozing and I noticed it. 30 min later I saw someone ringing the calling bell and I came out to check and there was no one. This happened again after another 30 mins and I made sure to open the door soon this time and noticed that someone from the next room locking the door with a hurry. I don't want to make it a issue and we left the day for sightseeing. Once we came back in the night and this repeated again twice. I got pissed off and called the manager and asked for a different hotel or I am going to police. He said he can not give me another hotel and the hotel manager kind of warned me saying you go to police the problem is for you. My wife was worries and she told to avoid talking further with them as we will leave the next day. Next day morning we had breakfast and came by the time the tour manager told us to be ready. All of a sudden he asked me where is luggage? We are checking out of this hotel and moving to havelock island. We were shocked as he did not inform anything about it and when asked he told he already informed. He told the car will wait for 2 mins and if we are not coming in 2 mins they will leave. We ran to the room and just dumped everything in the bags and came. Worst thing ever. Even a local travels would have organised things better with just 60% of what MMT would charge. We left for Havelock and that is when we started feeling better. The hotel was okay. The water games were awesome. We just started getting into a vacation mood. We spent 2 days in havelock and the moved to Neils. Neils was good too. The hotel was very good. But the food was bad in all the place. Last day we moved back to Port blare and was forced to stay in the same hotel where we had the worst experience. We had no other choice because they denied to give us a different hotel. I was waiting to leave the hotel for flight next day morning. Thankfully we did not have any issues this time. My advice is don't ever use MMT for any tour packages. Use MMT only for Flights book etc. For tour,choose a travel agent reffered by your family or friends.",1

1640,"Myself Dr. Bipul Agarwal planned my new year in Darjeeling and Sikkim through MakeMyTrip. I have never expected such poor performance. Their performance didn't seem to reflect their name in travel and tourism. MakeMyTrip executives started ignoring me after receiving the second installment. They always kept me on hold.In the following days, they didn't even try to contact me. I am mentioning thee name of my travel agents Swati Sharma and Krishna Patel. They committed for 15 kg baggage through SpiceJet. But they ditched me and I need to pay a lumsome money for my baggage. I was with my family of 6 members. You cannot imagine how difficult it was to manage things out there. They made a foolish itenary. Hotels that they booked showed poor performance. They made very poor arrangements for the breakfast. I even missed Nathula which is main tourist attraction. I am disappointed. With such poor performance they won't be able to survive in domestic markets of travel and tourism. At last I suggest the director of make my trip to improve their domestic services before entering the international market.",1
1641,"I am using Makemytrip from last 4 years. Initially it was used for hotel bookings and then for flights as well, they have one unique funda of makemytrip wallet in which they credit good cash backs with every transaction.

Each room night was worth for 3500 Rs, I am very happy with the norms and the prices available on makemytrip, it is really better than yatra or goibibo. Not only the prices MMT also have biger reach in hotels on every Indian cities. Pros:- Reasonable prices Cashback feature is really appreciated Free room night vouchers are awesome. Cons: Makemytrip is really bad in the cancellation of the ticket part.they really gives nothing many times. Customer care services are every late, and takes many days to respond. I would suggest for every frequent fliers or hotel going person to try makemytrip's services, You will be amazed to see the benefits to customer given by MMT. From my side its 8/10 rating for MMT.",5

1647,"I had recently purchased ticket from make my trip from Jaipur to Indore. Since there is no direct flight make my trip suggested me a flight combination for my trip on 27th December, 2016 Air india:AI-492 Jaipur to Delhi at 1:30pm Indigo:6E-436 Delhi to Indore at 4:50pm Since the air India flight got very delayed and finally reached Delhi at 4:40pm I was unable to catch my indigo flight to Indore. I spent nearly two hours from 1pm to 3pm calling MMT's service center but I was kept in waiting for an indefinite time after which my Phone was abruptly  disconnected and any further connection was made unreachable. After tryin few more times a random advertisement was played and the phone cut again. This created a lot of problem, I had to go by next flight and pay for it by myself in spite of already purchasing from make my trip. This was traumatic as I had to go through the entire airport security again which in Delhi is just cumbersome! This package was suggested by MMT and they should take responsibility for this nuisance and should reimburse me for the trouble they have caused me. I recently talked to a person who collected my feedback but she was absolutely unable to understand my problem .Moreover she blamed me that I did board the 4:50 flight! When I disagreed she forced me to talk to Indigo personnel with who I didn't even have any problem and also kept me on hold for nearly half an hour. After I told her to forward my complaint to a senior authority she agreed after around 2 hours of non co-operation. I was supposed to receive a call from someone within 24 hours but it has already been more than 2 days and I know if I let this matter slide they wont even attend to my calls again!

1651,"I thought that makemytrip is a genuine website which provides haslefree services to customers, now only I found out they use all the technological things to cheat the customers in the name of cashback .they just use cashback to lure the customers apart from that the cashback is one of no use, its just like pinch of salt for the remaining bookings we can use. I got some one 1400 rupees as cashback but I have to use the cashback I have to travel 13 or 14 times to use the cashback. they will make sure you dont use the cashback or else travel lot of times to use the cashback. book with other sites like paytm, you can use the cashback for all the purposes. Simple dont use makemytrip cashback, pure waste of time and money. Make my trip better make joker a symbol for your website as you make the customers like that",1

1653,"Make My Trip has completely ruined our Dubai Trip Experience. And thanks for that. Below are the issues which were faced by us from the date of booking. We had done Dubai Trip booking on 7th of December for 4 Nights 5 Days(21st Dec - 25th Dec) through Make My Trip. We made full payment for trip by 8th December. In spite of making full payment they did not give us air tickets and travel vouches till the last day. Only after continuous hours of calling at their customer care and sending emails to their executives we received e-tickets on 20th December one day before travel date. Going through tickets I found that they had made spelling mistake in passenger name while booking flight tickets(i had provided passport copy at time of booking). I had to again call executives and run after them to get it rectified. If this was not enough. We again got taste of Make My Trip service in Dubai also. 23rd December was booked for Desert Safari. And below things followed. 1- There was delay in pick-up by 1 1/2 hours, schedule pick-up time was 2:00 PM and pick-up was done at 3:30 PM. 2- No message was passed that there would be delay in pickup. And we kept waiting for car at hotel reception. Travel Agent would say car will be there in 5 min and hangup. 3- Our car was shared with other passengers at time of pick-up and drop. When it was a private transfer. 4- At Desert Safari gate we were again made to wait for another one hour for 2nd car to come and take us inside. 4- Due to late pick-up we did not get even 5 minutes of Dune Bashing and also missed sunset. 5- We were again made to wait for 1 hour at Desert Safari gates for drop at hotel. 6- Next day again we were made to wait 1 1/2 at reception for car to come and take us to Miracle Garden. This is the kind of service Make My Trip people provides to senior citizens. And on top of that Make My Trips(Senior Executive - Service Delivery) was more worried about his Travel Agent getting upset. As I was calling Travel Agent continuously. He blindly believes on statement given by Travel Agent and says nothing like this happened. It seems for(Senior Executive - Service Delivery) his Travel Agents are everything. If you are from middle class family and can't afford Dubai trip every year, I would suggest you don't go with Make My Trip. Thanks MMT for spoiling our once in a life trip.",1

To make our life even harder these idiots did not even ask what our date of births were and they made up our date of births to make the reservations and when it came to checking in with airline online our details from the passport won't match and it would not let us checkin.

Now the issue was that this wallet money had expiry date and when I called them multiple times requesting that they remove this restriction since this was my money and not any cashback anymore but they refused bluntly. Now on top of that the cashback amount expired 1 month earlier than what was mentioned. Also I came to know that I can use only 5% of total transaction amount from this wallet.

1667,"Hi All, This is regarding the Sri Lanka Trip me and my parents had taken from 8 Nov- 14th Nov 2017 with Make my Trip and Apple Holidays. MMT ID 160914032422 VR NO 20160913117 Booking ID: IN1609B6S1763513 We are really really upset with the way the tour was handled by both the companies. I am discussing some issues with you on this page. Apple holidays had got our whole itinerary wrong- All this confusion just before we begin our trip. The driver in Columbo told us that he was given another itinerary earlier and had just received the new itinerary when we met him. The First thing the driver told us was-'this new itinerary given to me- all fail! "" Thats how we started our trip- knowing that the iternary we were following was all wrong and inconvenient. We book from Make my trip because we believe you guys are experts at planning and making iternaries. If you have no experts dealing with Sri Lanka, you should have let us know. We had paid MMT add on expenses for 3 tickets for the following: Elephant orphanage, temple of tooth, cultural show, Botanical garden, Madhu river ride, Turtle hatchery, sirigiya rock, dambulla cave temple. a. Madhu river ride, Turtle hatchery(why was money taken for these 2 when we were not even going to bentota?) b. since India was a part of SAARC countries, tickets to some of these places are 50% cheaper than what was paid by us. When I asked the driver about this, he did not co-operate and neither did Apple Holidays- saying that they would not divulge any information about the tickets to us. We spent the rest of the trip thinking MMT and Apple Holidays have duped us taking the extra money. what I fail to understand is: Apple holidays rep calls me to ask me how my trip is going. But when I do have a problem, they ask me to talk to MMT and they cannot help me. These two big companies do cannot communicate to each other to make someones trip better/ or allay their doubts? Or am I supposed to keep calling each rep back and forth my whole trip? I still havnt received any mail stating the actual expenses of the tickets- or any refunds, and its been a month since I have informed MMT rep of the same. Pathetic! CHAUFFER: a. we were not, at any part before our trip, were informed that there was only one driver. b. At a lot of places- our driver would say-'this is the first time even I have come'. He did not know ways, timings or any information about most places. We did not want a 24/7 tour guide, but atleast someone with information about where the hotel is, or the local areas could be appreciable. Either he did not want to share information with us or he really did not know. c. The driver told us he would be on duty 6 am-6pm. and he would leave the hotel only after/at 8 am. If this is a rule, why was it not mentioned to us before in the emails? so I believe we had paid 3000 SL ruppes to watch the cultural show, but the driver insisted that we go to the gem museum. We kept saying we had no interest and were getting late for the cultural show. he left us no option- saying that we would get the tickets only if we went to the gem museum. so we found out that the gem museum gives free tickets to apple holidays to get'tourists' come and buy their gems: the driver Sam informed us Had we not paid for the cultural show already? so why force us to the gem museum? what kind of business is this? I dont know what confusion the driver and apple holidays had about liptons seat, but the driver was so angry that he was not going to be paid extra for those additional 18 kms, that he left us mid way telling us that cars are not allowed to go beyond.( we later found out from the guard that our driver had asked him to lie to us- Sam the driver did want to go further. so he told the guard to tell us that no cars allowed beyond that point due to construction of road.) We got off and started walking towards liptons seat. What amazed us that we kept seeing cars, mini busses pass us, going up. It took us more than an hour and a half to reach the top. Both my parents have had knee operations done and fell extremely sick. My mother- with the exertion- had started bleeding right in the middle of the mountains. When my father called sam to come at least pick us up back mid way, he faltly refused. This incident and what my parents had to face through I will never forget. If the car was not hired to go up liptons seat, we should have been informed before we began the journey- not midway. Sam himself had no knowledge about the place or the way- he realised in the middle of the drive that he was not going to be paid so he asked the guard to lie to us. We are very very hurt with this kind of lies and behavior. We de not have time to plan our vacations so we ask big expert companies like Make my trip to plan vacations for us. Not only did we loose our time and energy, we are taking very bad memories of MMT, Apple holidays and your hospitality.

1670,"I had a booked a bus ticket from Hyderabad to Nagpur from Make My trip, Pooja Travels, the bus operator, a sleeper class luxury bus. I was informed 2 hours prior that the bus will not stop at my selected boarding point. I agreed to which and I reached the boarding point as instructed before the time of departure. I waited helplessly for the bus for an hour than I tried calling the operator but no response, I tweet about it to make my trip and in few mins I receive a call from the operator called'Rafiq' who informed me to come to ""Medchal seven star Dhaba"" I agree to it. I look for auto at my stop at Paradise fire station, to understand that Medchal is somewhere 25km away from my Paradise fire station.i check taxi aggregators like ola and uber at 11:30 only to understand that travel fare to that point is more than the bus ticket due to surge pricing. I take another bus leaving later, few mins after  I receive the call from the operator'Rafiq' asking my whereabouts, after informing about the taxi fares he informs me to come in the same bus to Nagpur and the bus is leaving.  I question him why didn't the bus pick me up from Paradise Fire station, he says we tried calling you 20 times but call was not connected. I reiterate on this as I didn't receive a single call from the operator, I was waiting at the stop since 10 pm. One can't expect any Network issues in Hyderabad. After a long heated discussion he says there will not be any refund which was never the topic. But due to this experience I had to face a lot of trouble to reach my destination that too after a very hectic weekend. My only concern to make my trip is have trust and speak with your customers too, if needed take the operator and customer on conference call and understand the facts related to the issue. If a travel site like make my trip cannot manage this they shouldn't promote it as they only cause agony to another person who books trusting the goodwill of the service provider. This was my first bus booking from Make my trip and hopefully a last one. Make my trip is more concerned with Operator First policy.  I am sending the screenshot of my uber journey from my hotel to the stop where the operator informed me to come. Timing is mentioned on the screen shot for validation. Instead Make my trip and the operator which says I didn't arrive at the stop at the mentioned time.",1
1671,The Make my trip site is the worst travel site ever. It hangs very frequently and the option to change the bookings does not function. I normally use other travel sites which are so much faster and any changes can be done in seconds. Compared to those site MMT seems to be in the dark ages. Very heavy site and unnecessarily over complicated site. This is a complete avoid travel site which does not allow you to change your bookings at all. On a broadband connection this site has taken me 3 days and several attempts to just get to the page of choosing new dates and then it hangs. I would seriously recommend a big avoid for this travel portal.,1

1684,"In course of our tour in Arunachal Pradesh in October 2016 we stayed at Dirang for one night at Awoo Resort, which we booked through MakeMyTrip. We booked 4 deluxe rooms at the Resort and the payment also was completed. After two days, I received a phone call from Mr. Aloke Das who told me that unfortunately only 2 deluxe rooms are available on that day. He also told me that he would talk to MakeMyTrip about the matter. Within two hours I was informed by Mr. Das that as they respect their good relation with a valued agency like MakeMyTrip and as the rooms were booked through MakeMyTrip, they have arranged to transfer our booking from 4 deluxe rooms to 4 suits and we don't have to pay extra for that. The suits were really beautiful and we really paid the charge of deluxe rooms(Rs. 2500/- per room) instead of the charge of the suits(Rs. 4500/-per suit). The stay at Dirang was thus made more comfortable and enjoying. The courtesy goes, certainly, to MakeMyTrip. Thank you, MakeMyTrip.",5

1686,"Normally, I do not go for travel websites and stuff as I rarely rely on them. Few of my friends  already had unpleasant experiences with them. However, last month I had to book a hotel through MakeMyTrip.com, as I just did not have enough time to browse through the internet. All my fears regarding a poor experience with a travel website came true with MakeMyTrip. I went through the website and decided to book a 4-star hotel for my visit. The pictures of the hotel looked great on the website. However, upon reaching the hotel, everything was the opposite. The hotel infrastructure was similar to that of a 2-star hotel. MakeMyTrip.com executives told me that the my hotel would have all the facilities like Wi-Fi, LCD television, Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner and other such facilities. However, apart from the LCD television, none of the above facilities were provided to me in the hotel. When I told them that MakeMyTrip.com has all these facilities listed against your hotel's name, they simply said that they do not know about that! In fact, the management of the hotel denied any tie-up with MakeMyTrip.com! Upon my return, I complained about this fact and asked for the refund. Needless to say, I was not awarded that! The executives stopped taking my calls and responding to my mails. Finally, I had to reach the branch to get everything settled. In sum, I would advise you to go through their offers, especially their listings carefully and inquire thoroughly before making a booking.",1
1687,"With very heavy heart, I am writing you this mail for an extremely bitter experience with my travel booking through Makemytrip.com with Air Asia,  a SCAM being operated by Make My Trip & Air Asia Airlines jointly. This is regarding my daughter(Ms Monika Mittal) and son-in-law(Mr Kanwardeep Sing Gill) visit on their Honeymoon by Air Asia Flight No. D7-183, PNR-TEWJPS from Delhi(DEL) to Denpasar(DPS) on 4th Nov'16(Booking ID NN7302313791711). This ticket was booked via  HYPERLINK ""https://MAKEMYTRIP.COM"" MAKEMYTRIP.COM and while booking the flight only trivial details like passenger names, meal and seat preferences were asked from them. No details pertaining to Passport was asked for. On night of 4th November'16, after reaching Air Asia Check-in Counter at IGI, they were not allowed to board flight D7-183 due to the reason that one of the passenger's(Kanwardeep Singh Gill) passport had less than 6 months validity upon arrival in BALI. If the passport validity of 6 months was a prerequisite for boarding the flight to BALI, why Passport details such as Passport No. and Date of Expiry was not asked for, while booking the ticket. Make My Trip has specified all the VISA and Passport related rules on their website, but there is no mention of such rules on the MMT App. I have snapshot evidence of all this to validate my statement and same shall be produced at appropriate time and forum during legal proceedings, if need arises. MMT App does not have all these details, and MMT is promoting to use their App for ticket booking(with 5% discount), clearly prove their malafide intentions of minting money from customers. This is beyond doubt that the so called budget airlines “Air Asia” is taking advantage of the innocent Indian Passengers and minting money by incomplete information on their websites and applications jointly with Make my Trip. They won't even provide the reason for not allowing the passenger to board the flight in written, even after asking multiple times. They simply put every passenger who they don't allow to travel under No Show List. I believe they also charge certain penalty on the passengers on any next ticket booking for No Show Passengers. This was not only loss of our hard earned money to the tune of INR 1.5 Lakhs, which was spent on all the bookings, but also months of planning which they had put in for a once in lifetime holiday. The trip which was supposed to bring happiness to them, left them in misery and hurt. I will request the legal authorities to look into my case and these companies may be asked to compensate for my financial and emotional harassment, and should be taught a lesson that they don’t cheat the customers in future.

What a sarcastic way to handle a customer by a leading travel agent in India",1
1693,I use it's app for making my hotel orders and I found it more affordable and cheaper then any other apps. It is excellent in its service they provide good hotel with a little money and give many discounts . Not even this they provide complementary breakfast also which is very good. I used it almost 10 times and always prefer it . There app is also very easy to use and is handy . They have many good options for hotels.if you are going with your family then I recommend it to use the make my trip app. They have good hotels everywhere and in every cities. I recommended it to my friends and they also found it good and nice. And thanked me for sharing it to all.,5
1694,"Made a flight booking with MMT(Booking No. NF7291686653388). I was intimated that the booking failed due to technical reasons and that the amount of Rs. 13242 would be credited back to my account in time frame of ""upto 72 hours"". Called their customer service and 16:53 and was told that the incident was a one time glitch and would not happen again and to proceed with the booking again. I then made another booking(Booking No.NF729168665556) and the same problem again came up and the same ""solution"" was offered. So now after being duped of approximated 26k, I was told by two different supervisors(Mr. Vishal Desai & Mr. Mohammad) that the standard company policy irrespective of the amount of money involved is same that people have to wait until they get their money back. I was also told that apparently warning them that they leave me with no other option than pursue the matter legally and also putting it on social media for negative publicity is a threat by me against MMT. Simply put the MMT people should stop putting up customer service numbers because at the end of the day if  the only help that the customer service agents can give is to reiterate the company policy then why do we need to hear them. Just give us the company policy fine prints to read.",1
1695,"I have booked a 6 Night / 7 days package( 2 adult & 1 child) from 20 Oct 16 to 26 Oct 16 for coorg, ooty & kodikanal with booking reference ID IN1607B4S1179750. The booking done in month of July 2016 well in advance to get a best deal for hotel & flight booking. Problem starts when two days before departure got a SMS from airline about our flight got cancelled, when we brought this to their notice, MMT simply asked us to pay extra amount for new flight booking as their argument is MMT is not responsible for any flight cancel(how being a customer we are responsible for that), being a such big(claimed to be no 1) portal for flight & hotel booking they could not able to make alternate flight arrangement, I lost advantage of booking holiday in advance by paying extra money. MMT has given the itinerary during our travel, but it was not at all realistic we could not able to visit two important places at coorg due to lack of time 1. tala cauveri 2 bhramagiri peak. The property selected for stay at coorg was 4 star property as per MMT, but it lacks many ways, the toilet door handle was not working need to use screw driver to close & open the door, breakfast options are limited, only one person working as caretaker, cook, front desk manager etc. No responsible person available at property to take decision in emergency. How it can be rated as a 4 star property? when we reached hotel landline & wifi not working as there is no mobile network that was the only mode for communication. Many surprise waiting for us when we reached hotel in ooty(Mount & Mist according to our booking) the manager informed us the booking was not confirmed from MMT, we keep on calling MMT representative from various department to resolve our problem, it took MMT 3.5 hr to confirm the booking in other hotel(that to with repeated calling), we have to comprise to other hotel for our stay, as could not able to get accommodation in selected hotel which we have chosen post checking reviews & its location. we have missed all these things with opting for another hotel. MMT do not have a dedicated tour manager with whom customer can get in touch in case of any emergency. customer need to keep on calling various departments or their toll free numbers for resolution of the problem(that to explaining everything again & again to different persons). seeking refund for Mount & Mist hotel booking, we have made booking 4 months before travel date & paid money to MMT well in advance. I have paid for what I have selected & not for any compromises. we hoped for the best & memorable travel experience from MMT but unfortunately ended with bad experience with MMT.",2

1702,I booked my flight from Bangalore to Jaipur via Delhi 1 month in advance in Makemytrip app. I have to be in Jaipur on 11th november by 4.15pm. They changed the del-jaipur flight timings few days before the journey and are refusing to give full refund or provide alternative options and said I have to pay the cancellation fee too if I cancel it. Their excuse is that they will provide alternative option only if flight delayed by 2hrs and not 1hr. Bloody cheaters. Makemytrip is washing its hands off saying the they can't do anything if airline changes the flight timings! Now I have no option but to book another flight when I dont want to AND pay the cancellation fee too. Now I do not trust both Makemytrip and SPICE JET as they simply dont care about inconveniencing customers.,1

I have not initiated any cancellation. Their Mr Balu promised to have it checked and arrange a call back from supervisor - which did not happen. Though as per MMT they made an attemt to call and my number was busy(I have no missed call on my mobile today) On chsing them again, a Mr Gaurav first states that cancellation has been requested by me. When challenged to share the IP address from wher cancellation was done, he back tracked and said his vigilance team would check and revert in 24 - 48 hours. This is the second time I am facing issue with MMT. I urge them to follow up and have my ticket re instated OR share the IP address from which cancellation request has come in. I see this clearly as a fraud. I was conned, because the fare shown on the MMT site was not available on any other travel portal. - I am updating this review after the promised 48 hour time line given by MMT and their Ms Ritu(on mail). Ms Ritu, yesterday said, she is on leave(21Nov) and would reply today(22Nov2019). She does not respond to her phone and I have not received any revert on my mails or sms sent to Ms Ritu.

1708,"Hi, My Name is Sachin Karare and I have by mistaken booked a Hotel ""Astoria Residency"" in Ooty via MakeMyTrip.com for 22-Nov to 23-Nov, 2016 instead of 23-24 Nov. When I was booking the Hotel, I have seen Complete refundable amount till 2 days before the checkin. these are the below 3 Booking ID's with total amount of Rs. 4590/-:- NH2102832343055 NH2102932347723 NH2102932343875 So I cancelled the hotel and booked the same via MakeMyTrip.com for 23 to24 Nov, 2016. but when I called the customer care, he said that the amount is non-refundable as per the company policies. and also he said even you if you shift the dates there will be no refund. I have dropped an email on the same concern, and then I got a call from Gujrat of one of the Customer care executive'Mr, . Venkata "" and he genuinely said like this was an small issue and could be sorted out in the 1st time when you called the customer care. Then again he said, I will get back to you on this issue, which didn't happened. Now I got a call again from Customer care and this time again the same thing, there will be no refund on the amount. Then I have sent the screen shot of the MakeMyTrip App which have so many screen shots of Guaranteed Refund, which actually didn't happened in my case. After so many discussions on email chains. One of the executive called me and they said MakeMyTrip has agreed you to pay 3 coupons of Rs 1500/- each, But he didn't mentioned that only one of the Scheme can be used either of MMT voucher or these one of the 3 vouchers, These vouchers are of no use and cannot be combined with any of the offer. Overall they are making me Fool everytime, that they are looking into the issue and will sort out this and that, but now they don't want to listen, and everytime they interrogate why you have not taken the Screen shot, ( there should be one more advertise where MakeMyTrip mention:- please take screen shots while booking, so I would have done it earlier) Everytime I call customer care, I have to tell the entire story which is really time consuming and harassing to hear the same excuses form them. They always talk about refund policy but what about the Flaws in their website, which on the one hand shows Guaranteed Refund and then we receive vouchers with No-Refund policy. I am still awaiting for a good reply and actions from MakeMyTrip on this public forum. I want my money back not these Vouchers which are of no use. I have all the e-mail chains and all the proofs. which I have already sent to MakeMyTrip. Also I have heard recently MakeMyTrip is aquired by GoIbibo in news. Seems like my Money will be gone. But my next approach will to consumer court, I will not tolerate this cheating and will fight for the right thing.",1
1709,"Hi friends I used their service in last month where I wanted to visit another state on Dushera and I found the hotel rooms were not available for those specific date when I started searching on google I found the Reviews of Make My Trip and I contacted one of my friend he also recommended me. The worst part was I was not aware about the cancellation of the policy I was upset the amount was not refundable when I booked the hotel with a wrong place when I made a called to customer care they said it is not refundable at lease while cancelling the policy they should have informed me that the amount is refundable. The best part was I said to give them another chance luckily I got the booking in another hotel with a low price which was unbelievable when I contacted the hotel if we book direct what will be the cost per day, He replied me but the difference was 60 percent higher rates so I got the discount of 60 percent so I was very happy to get the discount which I covered the loss amount from my earlier booking and I got the vouchers too for next booking so I am happy and I started recommending this to every one.

1712,I had made a booking in a hotel in Vizag for my aged parents from MakeMyTrip website. They had to catch a flight the next morning around 6 am for Bangalore. When they reached the hotel the management denied any such tie up with makemytrip people and even rubbished the physical proof of the booking. My parents had to face humiliation and were harrassed. After that I called the contact mentioned in that site but that person denied any such link with makemytrip and hung up on me. I was really tensed as it was around 8 pm and my parents were tired feom a long journey. I had a talk with the hotel management and they offered a small room as I was not getting any hotel elsewhere at that time. I accepted. Then when I call makemytrip cust care they tell me that they have already checked in. When I told about these harrasment they just said they will escalate and nothing happened. Really a very bad experience. I have tried OYO many times and found it more reliable than this rubbish site.,1
1713,"I planned for a 6 night 7 day trip to Manali with family. It was perfectly planned and executed by makemytrip. Very much within budget that I had planned. The place where we stayed - Hotel - Holiday B&B had a very supportive, welcoming and caring staff. They will be the most preferred partners to stay. Indigo flights were on time and the entire vacation was very well executed by makemytrip. However one very bad experience with the transport services ruined our vacation. The transport service provider was - The Global Tourism, based out of Chandigarh. The driver(name - Sunil) was extremely rude, chaotic, moody, misbehaved, ill-mannered and completely customer disoriented. Even after repeatedly informing the owner of the The Global Tourism, there was no change in behavior. As customers we got stuck with the driver for the entire vacation period as there was no option to change but to live with the problem. I would recommend everyone that while planning vacation for Himachal - Shimla or Manali vacation, pls do check with Make My Trip on the transport service provider. If it is The Global Tourism then take your own bet and also do look for that the driver allotted for the vacation should not be Sunil. If planning for a vacation with Family, then he can be one person who can ruin the entire vacation with his misbehavior. I strongly recommend the owner of The Global Tourism to take some action against the driver.",4
1714,"There was an App based promotion going on. Being guided by positive reviews online, I logged onto MakemyTrip website to book tickets for Kolkata for Saturday(next day) morning flight. Some offer was flashed on the website asking visitors to book tickets through the app and get rewarded on future travel bookings. I opted for next day morning indigo flight scheduled for 7am and when I selected the flight and went onto payment, and afterwards received the booked itinerary, it was for JetConnect 2am flight. I am afraid booking on the app does not allow the luxury of having screenshots to be able to confirm to you that booking was done for Indigo flight scheduled at 7am and not Jet Connect flight scheduled at 2am middle of the night. Does it not sound ridiculous to you? why would I be crazy enough to book a 2am flight at 9pm(only few hours before the flight time) and cancel it within 5 mins? These 5 minutes were obviously spent trying to reach the crazy call center personnel as everytime I would select domestic departures, the call would end up with the international department. Moreover as I reached the right personnel they asked me to call up the Jet people myself and cancel the ticket. Is it not makemytrip responsibility to cancel it as it was booked through their App? I am still waiting for my full refund. Hope this review alerts future users about the strange working ways of this company.",1

It’s been more than that no reply yet. Amazing -We did not get the update regarding rescheduling I mean customers are fool asking you for rescheduling amount their executives do not find it important to check the reason behind any process. -Telling us points which were not at all discussed on calls.

1720,I Struggled to get my booking done. and when I paid the token amount got a revert from you that I have to pay 15% to get the booking confirmed despite of the fact that the booking is for next year; I have informed your agent as this is a group of 38 people and I will make the rest payment is next 2 months But the reply was the same; booking cannot be done untill 15% payment. I had an opt to book with some other travel partner which I did and I am asking for my own money; I dont understand how tough is it to refund the money; as nothing was booked. I have given 6-7 reminders to your agent but I think you guys are deaf dumb and even blind as I havent got a single reply. What I claim today on this forum is not built over one incident but series of incidences. Your customer service is the shittest ever. other online marketplace play a fair game unlike you. I had given a UTR number which is of no use as per my bank agent the refund is not yet processed and might be reversed; however your busy employee cares a damm about their customers you just know how to loot customers,1

1722,"Booking id NL20827233342 Makemytrip may be a very good website for flight booking, but has a very confusing holiday booking system, I had booked  a holiday to jaipur from 8th to 12th oct and the tickets came for 11th, on calling the customer care, after 7 days of follow up, they tell me that when I changed by blr to jaipur flight from 11 20 pm to 5: 30 pm on 8th oct flight, it reduced 1 day and the return ticket was changed automatically from 12th to 11th, and they said they couldnt do anything about it When I ask if I cancel my return flights only and what will be the refund I will get, they took another 3 days to tell me cancellation charges only and not the amount I will receive as a refund. I think makemytrip is just basing in the glory that they are the number 1 site for flight bookings in india and do not really  care that customers are what makes them no.1 and should focus on the same. Anyway, I will not be booking my next holiday through MMT, I will definitely look only for flights from Makemytrip.

However I have to shelve Rs 1500/- at hotel. Then I logged a formal complaint. They closed the call at least 5 times even after agreeing Hotel has agreed to refund the money.

1726,"One of the worst service provider ever I have interacted with. I had booked ticket 2 months in advance for my senior citizen father from Kankavli to Mumbai(NU270421765236880). On the day of departure the operator switched of his mobile(only contact provided) and was untraceable(Priyal Travels -(8433921712). I called up customer support 3 times between 7:30 pm(Departure time) to 8:45 pm. Ever time I got answer that my case will be forwarded to concern team and someone will call me back. My father(62 yrs) stood at isolated bus stop for nearly three hours without any help. Is this what you call makemytrip experience? To this day I have not got any apology or call from Makemytrip.com, only mail I got is my ticket is cancelled and I will get refund, that also less than amount paid(error again said by customer support).",1
1727,I am many time use Oyorooms for hotel booking if I travel alone. I am first time use Makemytrip.com last month when I gone to New Delhi with my family. I am going to other city for business purpose and payment pay by company but I face more problems in New Delhi hotels in room booking. I am already book plan and hotel at my home before 6 day of journey. I got sms for conform room but after reach face some problems about room booking. Finally we got room after waiting 2 hours.,1
1728,"I have been using Makemytrip website for booking airline tickets and hotel bookings for the past 10 years and experience has been pleasant.  I made the mistake of selecting hotel+ flight package for my Hyderabad trip from Bangalore to Hyderabad from 2/9/16 to 5/9/16 and got the booking done. I was to stay in Lemontree hotel in Gachibowli in Hyderabad. Due to some unavoidable reasons, I had to cancel only accommodation in Lemontree. When I called the callcentre, I was informed that I have to cancel the entire booking and rebook and if I cancel, I will loose the entire amount I had paid, lock stock and barrel. Thereafter I made an appeal to Lemontree management who also said that no money can be refunded. I sent a mail to makemytrip and I got the final reply on 3rd September confirming that no refund can be paid. They had helpfully advised that I could cancel the hotel booking only without any refund. I informed that if no refund is going to be paid, what is purpose of cancellation.  If I were to do my flight booking with air india, which according to the screenshot of Air India, I have preserved, was Rs.2570/-. Total amount paid by me to makemytrip  was Rs. 10127/-. So hotel booking cost was Rs.7557/- for 3 nights without breakfast.Today I checked on the hotel site and found that  room with breakfast is available for Rs.3350 per night. These are the amounts I would have paid, if I had booked flight and room separately. I did point out that in the terms and conditions, no where it is written that one has to loose entire fare and the room rent if any change is required but it is the policy of makemytrip and policy is more important than the customer even it is not told to him.  One has to remember that fare includes service tax and airport charges also. My booking id is NP2802454829139. This experience has been published only to inform netizens not to get carried away by this flight+ hotel packages and check before book.",1

1734,"Just wanted to let everyone know that I had a wonderful experience with Makemytrip.com do my entire land and domestic air for my month long trip to India. I am a professional travel agent in California with 25 yrs experience and India is my home country. Yet I wanted a local agent in India to take care of my hotel & car bookings because I know how things work in India. Moreover, I was taking my Italian husband for the first time in our 13 yrs of marriage and I just wanted him to enjoy the best of India and be blown away. My first contact was with Bhavesha Sharma, head of their CA offices. She was completely professsional and detail oriented and knew exactly what I needed from her. We started planning this trip in December 2011 although travel was to commence on 3 Apr 2012. Yes, it does take a lot of advance planning if you plan to go for one month to 10 cities and have zero problems! Bhavesha put me in touch with her team in Delhi, namely, Rajat, Rupjyoti and Uttam, all of whom practically held my hand throughout the trip, they were that thorough. I received the best prices at all the Taj & Oberoi hotels, car rentals in every city and domestic India tickets. I prepaid everything and received completely detailed vouchers for each hotel and car company. Everything went without a hitch. All the hotels had received payment in full upon our arrival so check outs were painless. Also each hotel was informed of our check and check out time and early/late arrivals and departures were requested for as needed and everything was seamless. A Makemytrip.com rep greeted us at every city with car and driver ready to transport us. I was worried about the first driver who was going to be with us for 7 days from Delhi to Jodhpur but Umesh driver was such a caring soul, he was simply a delight to be with! He even called us long after his services were over to enquire if all was well! All the other car and drivers arranged by MMT were professional and extremely good at their job. They took us to all the sightseeing sites and had a good knowledge of the city. Most importantly we felt safe and in good hands. Once again, everything was prepaid so no hassles when signing off. I recommend renting cars at the ""At Disposal"" rate meaning you don't have to count miles or hours or overtime. At the end of the day it made more sense and worked out to more or less the same as counting but without the headaches. In my personal and professional opinion, MMT is an excellent agency. Yes, there were lots of emails back and forth and every detail was dealt with. Yes, you need to ask a lot of questions and do a lot of homework but it's all worth it in the end. In a country like India where things can go horribly wrong and even seasoned professionals like me need local help, you absolutely need to work with an Indian agency and MMT is as good as it gets. My husband and I have travelled all over the world but to hear him say that this was his best trip ever, simply made my day!",5
1735,"Make my trip by far has been the best in convenience and quick bookings but there is just one thing that I didn't like. The make my trip wallet is quite misleading.

1741,Hello friends! I am going to give my review on this particular site known as make my trip. It has it's app also known as make my trip so  undoubtedly it is very easy to operate and their offers seem to be so attractive as well at first place but once you start promoting it with the thought that you would be earning more in my wallet but the fact is they have so many terms and conditions attached to it which are totally illogical and irrelevant.they don't allow you to book rail tickets with my wallet. What if you do not have an airport at the destination so it is just irrelevant travel site.,1

Also when we call at their call centre for such issues they simply say that we are unable to help you with this.

1743,"Hi team, Just wanted to share that my Leh Ladakh trip with MMT was fantastically well planned & was amazing. I am writing this feedback because when we were looking at reviews prior to trip we mostly found neutral or negative comments for most operators. However, our experience was exceptional and worth sharing! Good choice of local travel partner, however I would suggest a presence of MMT as well on such tours(just as a backup option):) Our driver/guide/photographer Mr.Tashi was waiting for us outside airport with a board. Best part was that he was dedicated to us for the entire period of our stay and we did not have fresh faces everyday. He was very friendly and a skilled driver(no rash driving). The Himalayan tour operator Mr.Sugam came personally to meet and greet us and took care of smallest of our requests. It was truly a wonderful experience. One suggestion, you don't need to visit donkey santuary and Leh palace. leh palace is very dirty and not preserved/smelly. Snow lion Hotel staff ijaz, Ali, Balu, Basu and Mr. Gupta were awesome too. We were given choice of room to select from and every nite dinner and morning breakfast was as per our choice. Food was very delicious and tasty that we don't even get such nice food in Bangalore. Overall a very good experience. I will surely use MMT service in future for my holidays. Regards, Anand",5

1748,"For hotel bookings I've always trusted OYO or Trip advisor. Once accidently. I used Make my trip's portal to book a flight ticket. That was one BIG MISTAKE that I committed unknowingly and was unaware of it. Due to some unavoidable reasons, I had to cancel my flight reservation and called the customer care for the same! In a few hours I realized that the Management is Sitting there to DO NOTHING! They don't consider our urgency and don't understand the situation of the consumer. When struck in such situation, a customer has no other option except for calling the management but What if the Management deliberately puts your call on hold and does not even try to rectify the problem! My call was put on hold atleast 4 times and a minimum of 30 minutes hold each time until I finally endup hanging up the calls! When I tried reaching them via mail, the only response I received waswait for a working day until we resolve the problem But next day the problem persisted. It took a few days of exertion and irritating conversations to finally get the refund! I don't know about the other facilities offered by the portal but FLIGHT RESERVATION IS A NIGHTMARE ON THIS PORTAL! I hope this review was useful to you. Like, comment and share if you found this review relevant. Thanks!",1
1749,I.ve booked from MMT several times and this was one of the few times I made a mistake of booking the bus from Make My trip through bus operator VRL travels to be stranded in Mumbai and incur additional costs of 4k for stay.My bus was from Mumbai to Vadodara- 11.30 p.m. I get a call at around 8 stating that bus is cancelled and to top it off that I should get the refund my going to the bus operator. The person dint have an idea on what service meant. However at 8.30 I get a msg from make my trip stating that bus will arrive at 11.30. however the number given is same as that from which I got a call.  I call back the number and a different person say  the bus will be there. So I make the mistake of believing the- based on my previous positive experiences.  Arrive near the location of bus and there are all shutters closed of bus operators. Call the number again and they say the bus is cancelled. Speak with VRL travels and they ask me to cancel the ticket and I shall get the refund. This undoubtedly is most unprofessional. It's probably the last time I.m booking from make my trip at least for buses. It's left a bad taste especially searching hotels in the middle of the night and incurring another 4k for stay and plans made in vadodara,1

1766,These executives are the most idiotic creatures that I have ever met. They are excellent in bluffing people. They promise you to give a 3 star hotel and finally give you some place which is similar to dumping yard.They have no courtesy to attend the customers calls when the customer is actually in need of help. They simply block your calls and not bother to respond to the mails too. Bloody cheaters promised to refund some amount and when asked upon now are acting like thieves. I recommend nobody should book their package from MMT.,1
1767,I brought 2 tickets of Mumbai to Riyadh via Qatar.I was about to proceed for the payment just before that I got a call from my aunt saying that there is no such flight on that particular date.I was shocked.If I would have paid then I would have to wait for 15 to 20 days to get my money back after banging my head on their customer care center.,2
1768,"WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED. Flight ticket from Mumbai to Chennai was booked on September 2015 and flight got cancelled due to Chennai flood. As flight was non operational, the full refund was suppose to be credited to my account. But that never happened inspite of the Flight service(Spicejet & Go air) has reimbursed the full amount to the agent(Make my Trip) on the 3rd day of flight cancellation. Make my trip after 3 months after doing rigours follow up started crediting my amount in instalments(Don't exactly know the reason behind doing in instalment). Its been a year, even around 2K is pending and ever time I call, the statement I get from the service is "" your case is escalated and amount will be credited within 3 working days). Its open way of flicking customers money. If Make my Trip is genuine, they atleast need to revert after seeing this post. Regards, Rashmi Jain",1
1769,One of the worst sites to do booking and they will not refund you your money and even the response from the helpline is not at all good. The payment was made from the bank account and the refund has to go on the same account upon investigating it was told that the payment was done from some timing account and the money is put back there whereas I don't have such account so where should I find my money. Horrible experience as they don't refund u ur money.,1
1770,"Makemy trip.com is one of the best site online platform.I think makemytrip doing a great job. makemytrip very economical. thequality of the service also good. I have great experience while booking a ticket through online.we can book online tickets for rail, flights road, and hotel bookings.The site & offers they provide are very good.I have been using make my trip since a long time.they offer good quality hotels at a affordable price. Makemytrip made my trip super awesome.Pls Use This Site.",5
1771,"Makemytrip is the best and awesome I thought I share my experience with mytrip.com. I have never booked a flight ticket so I googled a bit and there were a lot of recommendations that momondo is the best place to find tickets at a good price. So with momondo there where a few good options(considering flight time and price) and it directed to Mytrip.com. I honestly thought that if momondo is trusted, so mytrip.com seemed also like a fear play. The price was 230. When I started booking, there was also a 15 fee for Mastercard. I also chose the option for 7 to change or cancel the booking with no extra fees. I wanted to read some information about ""Terms and conditions"" about the pricing. The information page viewed and error page and that they are fixing it.",4
1772,"I am using this website since few months.MakemyTrip provide various offers time to time for flights booking and hotels booking but the main attractive feature is travel package they provide huge discount on them when we try to purchase separately not getting so much discount. Makemytrip user interface is very intuitive and it has all the possible sorting features to select the flights tickets to match the requirements and the fare calendar is very useful if we have flexible travel dates, it clearly states which flights are hand baggage only or Otherwise. Over in this site.I had an opportunity to book my excursion to Banglore by means of make my trek and it ended up being a stunning outing and tickets were done and all that much precise, general an incredible booking website and I should prescribe all individuals to pull out all the stops on the off chance that they need to book their outing through on the web. Its helps creating accounts with IRCTC which is very useful considering how impossible it is to recovery your lost IRCTC accounts. The only problem I have with them is the transaction fee they charge for making any flights booking payment Which is quite high at Rs.200.",4
1773,"My My trip Cash back program is totally worthless, they erase all amount in your wallet after 2 months. I would suggest to everyone if you are booking through Make My trip don’t  consider any cash-back thing. I am having bitter experience of it.",1
1774,"I made my last journey with make my trip from which I get 60% discount in hotels which I booked and also get discount on bus tickets.

1775,Make my trip is a my first choice when I plan a vacation. I have planned for a vacation to Thailand and Malaysia in February 2016. The service they provided is awesome. They came to the airport to pick us as soon as we arrived pattaya. The thing I liked well about them is their hospitality and their detailed introduction about the country how to behave in new country their passion of living and what are legal and not. I haven't expected that from them. they come to the hotel every morning in time and lead us to various destinations. I said this because we planned for a trip in first quarter of 2014 with other agency( i'm not interested in telling the name). That was not so fair as this one. I haven't seen any of the above mention accomplished heartfully. Pros: 1) Well authorised holiday trips. 2) Good customer service and costumer friendly(they tell every minute detail of the package) 3) Excellently designed interface of the Website Cons: 1) Flight tickets are a bit higher than competitive websites.,5
1776,I have sone booking through makemytrip and I have applied coupon code it was having some 300 cashback I have sent mail even after 3 days this people not responded . I am really not going to book any flight ticket from this website it was the last time I have done lots of domestic and international booking from different site 3 or 4 times I have done it from this site. One more thing if you are navigating through cashback site also this peole never gives the cash back So there is lots of option out there for booking dont book with this guys you will get the benefit of zero. So find some other alternative before booking from this people.,2
1777,Never ever trust them. I opted for Mauritius group tour package. Booked worst possible hotel which didnt have hot water n gave tap water in bottles filled from our bathroom. Promised sunset cruise and candle light dinner but didnt provide it but instead gave shitty reasons at the last moment. Rude tour guide in Mauritius. They didnt have any representative physically present in Mauritius. Seaside holidays is their partner who are biggest crooks n rudest guides ever seen. Makemytrip never helps/replies to ur email if u r in trouble in abroad and Everytime their partners asked us to approach them as we paid to makemytrip and not them. Worst idea if u r approaching Makemytrip for ur honeymoon trip! Please do urself n ur spouse favor and approach somebody else. They ruined our lifetime experience!,1

1781,"Once you visit the website of such an agent, you will have to enter the details of your travel and your contact information. Once you do so, you will be given a choice of airlines that meet your requirements - on a single page. You can make the comparison of different airlines just by glancing through one web page. you should be aware that there are many scammers in the world of Internet.

I again changed dates in same fare bracket and again this happened. Surprisingly after half an hour fare appearing was for 5780 and this was purely bluffing technique adopted by MakeMyTrip that when you finally click for payment fares are revised abruptly for higher amount. More astonishing fact that when I left MakeMyTrip site and gone to Skyscanner I find fare more less for 4000 and when I opted for a flight for same dates opted in MakeMyTrip site, I was shifted to Delta Airline site who confirmed my tickets for around 4000 rupees  which I immediately booked.

1790,"This is regarding my recent tour to Singapore. Very second day I realized my mistake that I booked a package from MMT. That feeling got more intensified in the days to come. Second day there was a city tour followed by Santosa. After the city tour is done we were waiting for the next pickup. In the last minute they(luxury and MMT guys)  told us that Santosa tour was not part of our itinerary. After a lot of discussion and conversations and after I was pissed off doing so. giving proofs of my booking they said there was an error and they arranged it for 19th as I had a spare afternoon, which I kept it for relaxation before the trip ends. Day 4, pickup for zoo happened at 7.45am which is too early. Well we reached zoo, the driver gave me zoo tickets but the breakfast with orangutan was not mentioned anywhere. I asked the driver he was very rude and said you should have it at your hotel. I told him I would not take the tickets without breakfast as I had paid for it. He was again so rude and said he was leaving. I then talked to the local MMT person. She said it is not a part of your itinerary. Again. I said I have paid for it and it is a part of my itinerary. after so many conversations over phone she said ""if you had booked go and have breakfast we will refund the amount "". We went to the restaurant where the breakfast was being served. They said if you have not booked earlier we couldn't help you. Not even a single table was empty. They refused to give us breakfast. I had to beg saying that I have a an infant with me and he is very hungry and we didn't have anything in the morning. I was standing there around 40 min to persuade the manager at the restaurant. As we didn't have anything in the hotel we were very hungry. The. Around 11 a. m(we were done with the breakfast after so many requests) I got a call from MMT person he said there was a system error. You can understand the pain we faced and we have an infant with us. I had to make so many international calls from my mobile phone, I had not taken any international plan as calling was free from our last hotel. Again a huge monetary loss. As MMT knew that we were traveling with an infant how could they book a ticket with twin bed. this is ridiculous. and sheer carelessness. The difference in the hotel charges is only s$10, if you book a king sized bed. The booking done in the parkroyal hotel was twin bed without any crib. again I had to beg but they were full so  couldn't give me a room having king/queen sized bed. I got the vouchers only a couple of days prior to the vacation I missed reading part in the voucher. But you being a tour agency, you did not care about that. how could you do that. I could not sleep the whole night. As it is impossible to sleep on a 3x6 bed with an infant. So I missed jurong bird tour next morning. Luckily I got a king sized room next day. Again. Again pathetic service The check in timing of Hotel parkroyal is 3 pm but the voucher mentioned 2  pm. Again we have to wait one more hour. This is some kind of fraud.",1

1795,Best part about make my trip is that they ought rightly say that they are the cheapest in the market and not once or not twice but multiple times I have been proven wrong. YES in some cases they do provide low rates stating that it is fully refundable but I would advise u to think before u get into the trap that they lay out for you cause they can change the details as soon as they have made the sale. For example I had booked a flight tickets for 2 for two-way journey but later on I get a call from the airline vender stating that the flights was non operational hence I cancelled my flight tickets staring the same. Now when I cancelled my ticket on the app I got a refund amount was stated as about Rs 9524 ( for which I did not get any form of confirmation) but later I got a message stating that a refund amount of Rs 6528 for which I wrote a mail to makemy trip ( after trying to connect with them on phone multiple times with no luck of speaking to any one) asking for an explanation on this. Today I get a call from Sheetal saying that the flight is in operational status. Now u can guess what would be my reaction on this. When I asked her few simple question for which she did not have any answer for and told me to speak to the airline vender. I guess any one who reads this would agree with me that if you are booking. A trip through a travel agency u would want them to take care of any kind of situation. But MakeMyTrip loves to play the blame game saying that the airline vender won't pay them so MakeMyTrip will not pay. This is just a simple example of what this company is able to do. With their customer. I just hope that this is very help full feedback for all of you. My only advice for all of you would be to do your through research before u do any payment with this company and not to do the mistake I did. Best regards,1

1797,These peoples fraud. I booked a hotel through them on 14th July and I paid through my Cred824it card. Then using those card details they deducted money twice.yesterday I got call from my Cred824it card company by saying that if I made 2 similar aishwaryasingh23ments to Makemytrip or not. I was amazed and denied for it. My bank department suggested me to talk with billing department of Makemytrip before filing dispute. I did same and what these idiots gave me the reason that I booked 2 hotels at same day and same time. And as hotel booking dates has been gone so they can't refund my money. Now am in the process of filing dispute against this fraud with my Cred824it card company and filing police complaint against this.

1798,"Never used such apps earlier as I prefer exploring the hotels & flight booking thru websites. I tried first time MakeMyTrip app on mobile & found its very helpful booking best & cheap accommodation during the Goa Trip. First hotel I tried is Pastina Resort in Dona Paula, Goa. Got it online with very reasonable price but had fear that hotel may be not good as compare to pics shown in the MakeMyTrip. When we checked in, it was too good, spacious n neat & love it at first sight. The hotel staff was also very helpful & provide the info about Goa also. Stayed it for one night & next day moved to another hotel which we booked online using MakeMytrip app. It was very cheap & hotel found to be very spacious, good & nearby Calangute beach. During the four day trip, we stayed in different hotel, all booked thru app & found very cheap, spacious, clean & good. Also got credits when my friend downloaded it in his mobile which I got the added advantage. Next time, this would be my companion to book the hotels online thru app using my credits also. I also did my flight booking using this app & got the good deal as compare to other sites/apps. Not sure whether other found it good or bad but for me this app proved good for me during my trip & can recommend to anyone without a doubt. Hope other would also like it.",5

1800,I have been travelling a lot from the past 5 years. And to be honest I have used MakeMyTrip to perform around 80% of the total bookings. According to me this site is very user friendly and is easy to navigate via all the sub links. Making is payment is also very easy and the most important the payment gateway is safe and secured. I also love the various offers that I can see on the page that tempts a lot. I also had some of the bad exoerience with this site. I will say that please do not try to book the train tickets via this site because you will be redirected to IRCTC official website and also there will be an extra convenience fees. Plus the refund process will get delayed if the trainb ticket was booked via this site as I have already faced the same issue. Also the Customer support needs to be improved as the agents need to be trained more throughly. Rest everything is fine with this site. I will rate this as 4 out of 5.,4
1801,"I thought of booking a hotel for my Nainital trip online. I checked few of the Hotels on MakeMyTrip and then settled down for the one. However, at the time of booking I was feeling like they are a bit costly then they should be, then the thought strike to my mind that this may be due to the peak season in Nainital and I ended up booking one. Day after that I was discussing the same with my friends and get to know from him that the same Hotel is available on another website at much lower prices(on the same dates, website like GoIbibo, and Yatra). Felt like losing my money and ended up spending around Rs 800 more for the booking of Rs 3000 hotel. So, I will not at all recommend the hotel booking from MakeMyTrip.",2
1802,"I have been a customer of MakeMyTrip.com since very long. I got to know of this website through search engines while booking tickets. I have been using the website for booking flight tickets and hotels. They have great offers on Flight+Hotel bookings. Being a Payback customer, I also get to redeem points and get rewarded for every booking. Booking tickets is very easy with the filters. Also the payment is hassle-free and secure. Now they have apps which has made even more easier to save your personal details and booking details. MakeMyTrip sends the tickets to the registered email-id in pdf format which you can just saw in the ticket counter for Pass. Till now I haven't experienced anything of regret. The best part is that they even provide customized holiday plans according to your choice of dates and activities. They have proper guides who get in touch with you initially with the itinerary and price lists and then lasts till you get back safe from the holiday. They make sure to book with them again.",5
1803,"Make MY Trip is a site with great features and is very user friendly. I used this portal as I travel frequently for my business purpose and have been using it from over 2 years regularly. Initially I found the site very helpful with attractive offers. Off late I find that the rates are hiked and offers given, this is what I experienced with some hotels which I booked through MMT ultimately not giving me any benefit. Also found their prices high when compared to other portals in many cases. The convenience charges are exorbitant goes upto 6-7% at times which is ridiculuous. Recently a booking done by me was confirmed and I received the confirmation mail, I was unassuming that I will get the eticket soon, which generally have got in all my other bookings, but in this particular booking even after getting the confirmation mail from MMT and my account being charged with the amount, I did not get the eticket. After few weeks when I needed the eticket, found that MMT had not issued the eticket. When enquired with the call centre( the most pathetic call centre service that a portal of MMT's stature can have), they said the booking was not made. I provided them with the proof the confirmation mail and told that the amount had been charged to my card, they say the booking is not done and they refunded the amount back, I did recieve the amount after few days, but was not informed by MMT that due to some technical glitch, the booking is not completed. When I needed the eticket, I call them up and then they inform that there was technical glitch at that moment. there was no communication from their end till I called up. Our program totally got upset and had to re book the tickets at a very high price and had to change our plans and make reservations at the hotels at astronomical rates. Everything was thrown out of gear. All this because of the fault of MMT and they have the audacity to say that it is not their fault and nothing can be done. Till we transact with them, we are their valued customers, but once any issue comes up your requests are thrown into the garbage.Such is the attitude of their team. It is already more than a week of continuous follow up their team through phone, mail, social media and they are not responding now. Also found a interesting thing with MMT on one or two occassions, that if you are registered user and when you are login using chrome browser, in the normal mode you will find a higher rate and when you use the incognito mode, you will find a lower rate if you dont login. So can we assume that registered users are being made fools this way(Note this has happened only on few occassions so am not sure) The main reason I suggest that you either dont use MMT or use it with great caution is they dont take responsibility for any mistake from their and this could totally ruin your trip/holiday. The rates are higher in most cases when compared to the other portals especially the hotels. The convenience fee charged by MMT is exorbitant. Many times the displayed rates are different and change to the higher side while trying to make the booking. The after sales service is so pathetic that I have no words to describe. My friends had earlier suggested not to use this site, but now I have experienced it and so am quitting as a patron of MMT and also will suggest to my friends to uninstall and not transact with MMT unless they are willing to take the risk of spoiling their plans. *PROs: Good Website, User friendly CONS: High rates, High convenience fees, Pathetic after sales service, High risk factor using this website, it can ruin your holiday if any issue is there as you are stranded and no help from MMT* Good luck to the users.",1
1804,"This was my first and worst experience with MakeMyTrip, 1) I was not able to book online, so I had to go for offline through makemytrip-agent 2) I did not get any discount shown on website, in my Case Price shown on website for my package was 9K, for 3 persons it should be 27K plus 8K discount/offer for online. But offline I had to pay, 52K no discount, almost double of what I expected with promise that package has been upgraded to better service/hotels. What I got for this high price was so bad service, first pickup-service, driver dropped us to wrong destination wrong hotel, after wasting 1.5 hours we reached correct hotel, which was actually very 3rd class hotel, (I dont know what do you provide for lower package), customer support was too poor, it took us almost 2 hours, to connect, explain and finally reach NO-CONCLUSION, they said we don't have choices, so we had to go ourselves out and book another hotel, it was another 3 star hotel, much better and with reasonable price, but our whole day was totally wasted, we could not go anywhere same day, it was already night and we were so tired. So we did practically nothing, just rest. Please stop selling packages if this is the level of service you provide. I tried to give my same honest feedback on their FB wall, but seems dont let it published. Sad:)",1
1805,"My experience with MMT is amazing and i've been using this always while booking THE GOOD 1) Website is user friendly 2) Variety of hotels and proper information of the place 3) The Payment method This site is best for selection of hotels and you would definitely love it .

In my opinion make my trip is best site to book a flight ticket online . As they are selling cheap ticket as compared to another sight.Travel light - avoid bulky suitcases and unnecessary items I have never seen my father travel on business with a bulky suitcase. He says it is easier to utilise the laundry at the hotel, than carry around a heavy suitcase. He always carries basic clothing, medication, toiletries and important documents in little pouches to keep them organized. One thing he never forgets is to check the weather to wherever he’s travelling to, so he’s not stuck without a jacket when it’s snowing outside!Ask the people at the local company about the time it takes from one location to the other, so you can plan accordingly.",4

The basement was very cool in terms of games like pool table, table tennis accompanied with sounds system. I have visited Jaipur many times but first time I felt that I was staying at lovely and happening place in Jaipur. Now talking about interior of hostel including Kitchen and bathrooms were neat and tidy and walls were decorated by good paintings . Its was reasonable and a good accommodation to stay in Jaipur. Let me share a amazing and rocking moment as it goes, On the eve of  festival i.e. HOLI I celebrated in same hostel with so many tourist which was quite interesting and enjoyable time for all of us I literally felt that I was playing in my own house with my friends although I was very far away from my home and the more enjoyable part was that the Hostel staff arranged lovely party which was brilliantly managed, systematically arranged which was covering all the requirement of the people who were staying there, so I could not stop myself to capture that amazing, brilliant, unforgettable, inexperienced, Rock and roll etc moment of my life for this beautiful moments of my life I specially thanks to Tanay, Sunadar, Govin and Kathrine who all are belongs to RHH team. see you soon all next time at same place.

1808,I booked a ticked from bangalore to kolkata with jet airlines a(non refundable ticket). Due to certain unavoidable conditions I happened to reschedule my travel. Make my trip came up with another additional charges for reschedule with indigo and after the amount was debited from my account the system showed up a beautiful adorned html page which said that my booked was not confirmed . After calling up the support guys I was informed a jet ticket cant be rescheduled with other airlines . I still dont understand why did they come up with all other airlines options and even route me to the payment gateway when the reschedule with other airlines was not possible. All said and done I asked the customer care guy to refund me back the extra money which they debited . I was assured of a refund within 6-7 working days since then it has been 12 working days and customer care people beat around the same bush telling we have escalated the matter to our supervisors. This has been the most disgusting experience ever and I donot recommend anyone to go for mmt . They simply block ur money without any prior information in their app!,3

Pathetic service and these nonsense and useless  shitty needs to get noticed son for the protection of customers. Furthermore, the cancellation charge from the airlines was for 3 passengers as the journey and return were a single booking. MMT charged for 6 passengers where it didn't even deserve a single penny.

When I checked my account there was no date set or displayed. I even shared the screenshots with MMT team and I was promised that if this is an issue from their end then the milestones will be credited to ne xt cycle. After countless number of followups with Jcky Chauhan and his team all I get to hear is promises. They are so shameless that will will lie to your face. I am highly frustrated.,1

The quotes are sent by mail and can be discussed with their personnel over the phone. The employees are very helpful and will give you various quotes as per your requirement. I had recently planned a trip and asked for an estimate. I was given various options to choose from as per my wish. All types of plans with different prices and days were provided. All the bookings were done by them and I had to just take out prints and show to the hotels. The driver was waiting for us at the airport and we had no problems whatsoever. Certain discount offers are also provided by the site from time to time which makes the trip a little cheaper. I would always recommend the site to everyone and would definitely use it for my next trip.,4

1820,"We had travelled by makemytrip to leh on the 21st of May and returned by 29th may. It was one of the most horrible experiences we had. Ours was a flight only with a hotel at Delhi package which was booked under 2 booking I.Ds. One as a flight from Bangalore to Delhi return. The other was a booked as a holiday package booked from delhi to leh and return on their chartered flight with one night stay in Delhi. The ordeal of booking was never ending with the bookings delayed so we could not get the hotels we wanted. A package that was promised and  after payments were made, we were told  that the hotels were no longer available so we will have to choose another one. Finally we reached leh after making arrangements for stay on our own. The return flight from Delhi to Bangalore at 1:00 Pm was booked without baggage option and we were told we might have to pay Per kg. So it was expected that we shell the amount. How can anyone be so stupid to think that the luggage would be left behind during vacation and we will be travelling with only hand baggage. This is the fare That was not the end. On reaching the airport we realized that the agent booked us on 1:00 am flight from Delhi to Bangalore when our chartered flight from leh to Delhi was 9: 00 am in the morning. We were expected to travel from DELHI TO BANGALORE EVEN WITHOUT THEIR CHARTEREDT REACHING Delhi. Our repeated calls were shuttled from one department to another saying they are not responsible for it.We were stranded for 6hrs at the airport facing lots of mental stress and trying to get the issue resolved. Finally we did current booking  paying an an exorbitant amount from our pocket  inspite of  paying  makemytrip Lakhs of rupees for our holiday package and travelled home. We were told we would our money would be refunded once we provide the booking voucher and boarding cards. WE HAVE done the same but it’s a month now that makemytrip has not got back to us by mail or phone and neither refunded the money. The mental harassment and the torture have made our trip a nightmare. It should be called as MAKEMYTRIP A HELL AND NOT MAKEMYTRIP MEMORABLE.",1
1821,"MakeMyTrip is an astounding idea for the individuals who loves to go, as they guarantees to improve their experience even at an unmatched value bundles. Be that as it may, does it remain constant for all class independent to spending plans. All things considered, to my family, me and my companions the experience we had at efficient spending plan venture, whether it be inn booking or be it making a trip to another destination inside the nation is not all that pocket well disposed or at neighborly sticker price. In the event that in the event that it ever offer you at season, the lodgings or resort's are beneath bar in contrast with what were shown in their official site, makemytrip.com. Numerous neighborhood resort proprietors had additionally said the holidayportals do it frequently particularly to the exceptional occasional rebate customer's. I question to them(makemytrip), for the sake of markdown fair(mela) isn't they harming our trust or they couldn't care less about financial spending plan clients. We were frequently compelled to arrange lodgings at higher cost at the premises by inn chiefs, as the prior inns booked by means of makemytrip doesn't worth staying at numerous cases with family.",4

In case if it ever offer you at season, the hostels or resort's are below bar in comparison to what were displayed in their official site, https://makemytrip.com. Many local resort owners had also said the holidayportals do it quite often especially to the special seasonal discount customer's. I question to them(makemytrip), in the name of discount fair(mela) isn't they hurting our trust or they don't care about economic budget customers.  We were often forced to negotiate hotels at higher price at the premises by hotel managers, as the earlier hotels booked via makemytrip doesn't worth staying at many cases with family.I always had a bad experience in most case.",1

Pros • Very well laid out app which covers most aspects of your travel like hotels, holidays, flights, trains etc. • Unbelievable cashbacks and best deals. I once booked a Rs 4500 night hotel for Rs 125 using my cashbacks generated on previous travels and flights. although deep discount deals are getting rarer these days. • Reliable app - all my bookings were honored by hotels. I'd like to mention that with Goibibo my confirmed booking was declined by hotel without any kind of official communication whatsoever and I landed up in deep trouble. So for your safety always choose makemytrip. • Widest coverage at most locations. • Lowest price alert and other such innovative app features. Cons: Could not find any, works like a charm for me.",5

1827,I had a bad experience with make my trip. I had booked air tickets from the web portal. The transit time between the connecting flight was less so I asked the customer care people that how can I reduce the risk of missing my connecting flight.

I repeatedly told him that I am not asking him to intern-vain make my trip to do any thing but they can at-least provide me guidance about how can I minimize my risk of missing the connecting flight but they did not understand. After this I mail to customer care department but I did not receive any reply. It is also difficult to contact customer care on the phone numbers given on website because if you have booking then only your call will be contacted to customer executive or else the call will get disconnected after advertisements.The toll free number also works the same.,1

We are regular customer of MMT and associated with MMT more than 7 years. On 18th Jun 2016 I come to know that my wife has conceived and really it is not advisable to travel in such hilly region. So I called MMT on the same day and told about the condition but have not received any reply for 2 days. After two days I have snnt a mail and again called the agent and inform about my wife pregnancy case and requested to change my destination anywhere in India or abroad. But the agent informed me that they do not have any policy to refund or change of location for pregnancy case. Till now MMT have not given any ticket, hotel confirmation as they have the policy to give all travel document only before 2 days. And they are not ready to refund for a genuine medical emergency case much before 15 days. SO THIS IS THE end OF MMT IN MY LIFE. IN-SPITE OF MANY OTHER BAD REVIEWS WE WERE ASSOCIATED WITH MMT FOR SO LONG.IF I WON'T GET REFUND I WILL FILE A PETITION AGAINST MMT FOR THEIR RUDE ATTITUDE POLICY AGAINST PREGNANT EMERGENCY CASE.",1

1845,"The package booked was North East delight with Lachung -Summer special Premium package. Inspite of being a premium package, the vehicle provided was Trax traveller which is no less than a goods carrier vehicle. Though it was mentioned that amongst the travellers were people aged 60 and a baby girl 6months old. The air tickets were given at the last moment after several follow up calls. During the Gangtok to Lachung travel, the roads were blocked and my family had to spend whole night in that vehicle with no food and water supply, with some unknown passengers in the vehicle that make my trip team had clubbed without our consent. My parents already having blood pressure problems could handle the situation and my mother had a panic attack.Baby girl started facing breathing problems.

Not a single person helped in such critical situation.There could have been a loss of life in this case, but fortunately the locals helped.All the attractions spots were boring and the package was just a mere waste of money and time. The other travel companies have a better itinerary.Also, when we tried to lodge a complaint for the same, the employees just keep on transferring the call from one department to another. They just keep beating around the bush and no one pays attention.Extremely careless employees and worst service ever.Please readers do not ever opt for Make my trip.",1
1846,"Started from Airport and mini bus booked was smelling like hell. At time of checkout hotel asked for money for extra beds - which was pre-booked in package. Bus driver doesn't know the address of hotel for a journey of 250 km took 10 hrs. Reached Ooty where only one room was book - Pre-booked 6 room and paid for that. Asked for 3 star hotel, given 2 star that also without AC. Gave extra payment of 1.5 lakhs and still wating for refund from 11 days.

We were placed on numerous calls with MakeMytrip Custome care and Hotel owner and finally after a lot of discussions and request from hotel management we agreed to manage with three rooms provided we get refund on one room. We have called your customer care several times and every time we were told that your amount will get refunded in 7 working days and the amount comes to Rs2030. finally when I wrote on Facebook, they initiated my refund but just of Rs101.

1856,"I was planning a family trip to Port Blair, so I wanted to book air tickets from delhi to port blair. I've heard a lot of makemytrip so I tried to book from there. It was showing 72000 for 4 people which was a good deal at that point as other sites were showing up 75000. So whenever I tried to continue my booking either it raised the amount to 80000 or transaction failed. I tried may times but to no use. Makemytrip's app amd website is good, providing good details but I faced some problems on flight bookings. Though I booked 2 hotel rooms from MMT which was a good deal for me. I would like them to resolve that issue.",3
1857,"Hi, I booked my ticket from Delhi to Chandigarh and it has been cancelled by airlines due to time change by airlines. And it was on may 4th 2016, also I got a cancellation request from Make my trip after 4 to 5 follow ups with MMT. Attached both screenshots from MMT and Airlines Cancellation receipt. Never ever go with Make my trip, they dont have proper hold with Airlines and their customers. We never interact with Airlines for any reason while booking, but when time of cancellation they are requesting to go to Airlines office and get refund. This is really insane. The online complaint form thing does not work either. Tried posting a complaint and service request 6-7 times but received an error message repeatedly. Basically there was no way I could cancel my booking and I lost my money. I am disgusted with the customer service of make my trip that boasts of brilliant customer care.

Every day I am  calling customer care center, explaining my issues to n number of folks, arguing with them to get the things and requesting to share at least draft itinerary but  in vain.

Entrance from moongla main road for the property will give you a feel of local meat bazar type feeling, moreover they dont have parking arrangments any body who will stay in this property he/she need to park vehical on road side which is completly unsafe( no guard). If u book this property from any of the travel site& after that ask any local support to propert owner if needed he will ask u to talk to agent or company who booked ur booking.

1861,"Recently I visited Paris and London along with my family, using Makemytrip's customised package where they were providing transportation from India to places+hotel accommodation+ Hop on-Hop off site seeing tickets+ entry tickets to two attractions at each place+ visa assistance.  I must say that the sells person was very good and and prompt.  Visa assistance was also very professional.  After making the final payment I received all the vouchers and tickets 4 days before our journey, that is when I realised few  disappointing points as below: (i)   I was confirmed at the time of booking that they are not providing any departure drop off at Paris and pick up in London as the departure station(train) in Paris and arrival station in London will be within a walking distance of 10mins maximum.  However, on receipt of al the vouchers, I discovered that although their commitment for Paris was true but for London, the Hotel they booked was 6 miles away from station!  Although I requested to make a change of arrange a pickup, Makemytrip did not do anything sighting last minutes changes not possible! (ii)  All the sightseeing vouchers and entry tickets were provided for a single day.  How can someone cover all the places in one day and moreover when we were staying there for 3 days!  I again requested them to split these, but they came back saying not possible. In the bargain, I had to spend lot of money additionally, to make our trip comfortable and visit all the places of Must See, which was initially planned to be taken care by Makemytrip, as per initial discussion!  What I found un-professional here is that after getting full payment only they confirms the hotel etc. so you have nothing in your hand to negotiate! I have the above two disappointments for my short 6 day's trip, however, these two points only can make a hole in your pocket.  I now think for my next visits, I have to doubly sure, what is being committed and get it in writing in advance, before paying off the money.",2
1862,"I have been a regular customer of MakeMyTrip. My family and I have so far found this travel website one of the finest so far, meeting and in many ways exceeding all my expectations till date. Services have been prompt, travel advise genuine and overall the friendly nature of the staff have been extremely satisfying. Be it Shillong, Pune, Hyderabad or Bangalore, MakeMyTrip hasn't failed me in any way. At first I was a bit hesitant about online transactions, and that meant going to their office in Calcutta with their extremely professional employees taking care of my needs. I dont go to their offices anymore, from the convenience of my home I book tickets and plan journeys online. Thank you so much guys. You all deserve a pat on your back for the excellent service. No wonder this company ranks amongst one of the top employers in India.",4
1863,"Make My trip really sucks! Booking through Make My trip is more like ""Make your own trip, but pay me for that"". We had booked China package with MMT in May 2016 and it was a TERRIBLE experience. I would request or warn all the readers to not book with MMT. STAY AWAY from this travel arrangers. They are extremely unprofessional Truly speaking their services are limited to taking money and it ends at that point later on it is left to small tour operators which they engage in foreign counties After this no customer care service works. There is no complaint cell where one can register his grievance or escalate the matter. I am giving day by day account of our trip in China We paid initial amount and for next 50 days there was total silence from MMT. They woke up after we told them that its high time they take action for our VISA. In fact some people in our our group had their VISA delivered on day of travel! When we asked for air and train tkts in China we were told it will be handed over by their partners in China but local tour operators never handed over the tkts. When we landed in airport.there were no pick up organized because tour guide was waiting at wrong terminal So group of almost 28 tourists had to wait at Beijing airport for almost 2 ½ hrs. Two ladies who came alone from Calcutta via Bangkok  had to take taxi and go to Hotel and to their horror they were told by Hotel reception that they don’t have booking in Hotel . IN PUBLIC INTEREST - I WOULD LIKE TO SAY DO NOT GO WITH MAKE MY TRIP FOR YOUR TRAVEL SUPPORT.",1
1864,This app is very good and service is also very good and I got discourse also so I can say I love make my trip. And customer support is also very good. And I got best deal also and nice hotel and nice food also with AC car so I will give 5 star to make my trip.,5
1865,MMT is good for booking not for rescheduling or cancelling. Most of the time one can't log in to their site easily to cancel. If u call Cust Service no. You will get rep only after exhausting 60%battery on ur mobile min 35-40min. They don't have enough people to serve. Being 7yrs old Cust of MMT finding too many lapses in their system and Cust services off late . Website not interesting and user friedly. Cust care services over phone is only fast for booking takes hell lot time for existing booking. Avoid avoid these people. Too much business minded not service minded.,1
1866,"It is one of the most reliable sites for travel bookings . It is very reliable and customer friendly . Refunds are not time taking and you get multiple discounts in hotel and flight bookings .The customer reviews are all genuine and you have hundreds of hotel and flight options to choose from. They also offer some holiday packages however, I havent tried them yet but plan to utilise them in future. The make my trip app is very convenient and easy to use .",4
1867,MakeMyTrip has got good reputation so I prefer to order bus from it. From Delhi to Jammu in star bus volvo ac sleeper but at the time of departure there was a local sleeper bus instead of volve ac sleeper bus. If they are not having such services they should edit the details they provide to their customers and stop fooling customer and spoiling customer's mood and trip. I just did't expected this from MakeMyTrip such type of service.,1
1868,"I have made a small booking with Hotel Sonar Bangla Kolaghat Medinipur for 2 nights for my family from 10.06.2016 to 12.06.2016 vide booking reference no NH2P114424889178 through  Make My Trip on 21.05.2016. This is my first business with Make My Trip. In the hotel confirmation voucher of Make My Trip, it is clearly written under ‘Hotel Cancellation Policy’that Free cancellation is offered till 09.06.2016 upto 02:00 p.m. There is no other condition written in the slip which even remotely disclaims the above note. Due to my father’s sudden illness, I am obliged to cancel this booking. I have cancelled the booking on 30.05.2016. But to my surprise, an amount of Rs 4213/- was imposed cancellation penalty. This is a clear violation of your terms and conditions and an attempt to befool your consumers by violating your commitment. I have made so many bookings earlier with Agoda, Cleartrip, Booking.com etc on several occasions. Last year also I had to cancel my Aurangabad booking with Agoda and no violation of contract was there. If I had to pay penalty for cancellation of booking, I would have made my booking at the Hotel office directly. I have chosen your website only for the free cancellation policy. Otherwise, there were other sites offering the same booking at a lower price. Imposition of penalty is a blatant violation of the Contracts Act and I request you to refund the penalty. Your publicity of free cancellation with Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt is deceptive and they should also be held respobsible for such deception.",1
1869,"I made my booking through makemytrip.com for 7 days 6 nights to Pattaya and Bangkok, Thailand. Overall I felt quite disappointed with their service, going back on commitment, hidden cost etc. I will give the overall experience 0.5 star due to following reasons 1.    Flight ticket – Trust me you can i.  cheaper flight ii. at better timing(not at odd timing) on your own than what is recommended by MMT MMT will tend to recommend you costlier flight at odd timing. 2.    Food voucher - a.  In the name of Indian food, many travel advisors(I saw MMT, Kesari etc.) book the same hotel like Great Punjab in SOI 13, Bangkok. Not sure why because there were at least 5 other Indian restaurants in the same vicinity. May be the restaurant was charging penny to these travel companies. b.  The travel advisors take Indians like herd(a lady carrying flag and many following her is a common sign) to the restaurant c.  Hotel treats travel advisor customers like second class citizen. Even the entry for travel advisor customers / group booking is not from the front gate but from the behind gate as if they have committed some crime. d.  The restaurant i.  gets extremely crowded – long queue for self-service(travel advisor customers are not served; others get served) ii. AC hardly works – you will profusely sweat if you have got some corner table iii.    provides poor food(Rotten / spoiled /burnt vegetable/ dal etc.) iv. and poor service(long wait time for refill of rice and chapatti) we paid 9101 INR for 5 days’ lunch / dinner, which amounts to 1800 INR per day for dinner. I guarantee that in similar amount(or probably lesser amount) you will get much better food and service. 3.    Booking experience- a.  MMT is quite prompt when it comes to taking money. There advisors won’t mind you to call even at 12 midnight b.  Once money has been taken they become elusive. They won’t respond to the email, message etc. MMT leadership is another farce who will never look into any reported issue. c.  MMT hires ITC in Thailand. It may happen that MMT would mention that on day X there will be visit to a particular location and ITC can handover different itinerary to you. In the MMT voucher, it mentioned Nong Nooch on 23rd whereas ITC mentioned it on 24th. d.  ITC staff will say, I am just the worker not the owner, you please call Mr. X … e.  If you have done your own booking seeing MMT didn’t organize anything in any given day, you might get into trouble of handling ITC. We had booked SIAM Niramit on 24th seeing no activity by MMT on 24th. I had real trouble just because ITC arranged something on 24th. In fact, our whole family had to go in wet clothes from Coral Island to Nong Nooch village on 23rd because ITC told they won’t be able to make arrangement otherwise even if we delay by 10 minutes. A bus is going that side and we need to go in the same. f.  MMT / ITC will not include best of places like Royal Bangkok palace, Ancient city etc. but will include travel to Gems factory. As if you had gone there to see shopping places only. g.  In the beginning MMT will tell you all sightseeing included. But later they can give you ticket and ask you to make your own arrangement for travel. It has happened to me with Safari world. I was given email, which states Safari world & Marine Park with lunch+ transfer+ tickets – x amount . Whereas later I was told transfer is not included.",1

Our hotel experience till Sikkim was excellent but when we moved to Darjeeling in Hermitage Resort, suddenly it became worst. We were in a group and booked 3 rooms. The hotel rooms were worst especially bad smell surrounding the rooms because they dumped all their hotel wet cloths near the rooms at 4th floor. After checked in, I immediately complained to their manager Yogesh, instead taking an action, he asked me to check out if I had so many problems. This showed how they were unprofessional. Even I requested them to change our rooms but they didn't give any heed. Even hotel was not equipped with basic facility like WiFi and mobile network coverage in it rooms. This was very disgusting and unmemorable experience from MMT and worst hotel Hermitage Resort. Please be aware while booking package tour with MMT.",1

1875,"I am wrtiting this review after writing the following complaint to MMT officials and have been waiting for response since 23-May I am extremely disappointed and was cheated by the services I got in our trip to North –Shimla, Manali and Delhi. My booking Agent - Tejas Gajjar MMT Booking ID – IN1603BOS309742 Following are the concerns: 1)  Day before we were to travel 12th May we got a call from transport point of contact saying we will get Swift Dezire to pick us at Delhi airport. I have paid extra amount of 7K+ for upgrading Dezire to Innova and it was not reflected in the records. I had to call at least 4-5 folks to get this corrected. Till 10 PM in the night I did not get confirmation that we will get Innova for our Trip 2)  When we reached Delhi airport, we saw that Innova given to us was not in a proper condition and the same reflected in the way the driver handled the car. He drove slowly and switched off the AC as we reached Himachal. It was very hot 40+ degrees and we requested him to switch on AC but he did not though it was not a GHAT area. As roads were under construction and lot of dust and pollution outside we faced lot of challenges without AC and windows open 3)  When we reached the Shimla the breaks of the vehicle were failed and we had to carry all the luggage to the uphill where our hotel was positioned. I think you will understand the pain we have gone through after a journey of 12 hours walking up hill with the kids and luggage. 4)  I have then called MMT support to ask for replacement of the vehicle and NO response of the complaint I made. 5)  Hotel rooms were very congested and were not sufficient for 3 Adults and 1 kid. 6)  The whole planning is not appropriate and the iterinary was not done according to the plan. a.  Day -1 we were planned with Shimla local sight seeing, as we reached at 9PM when can the sight seeing happen? Travel of 10 Hours b.  Day – 2, Driver was every time mis guiding and made us pay extra amount to get into another travel saying Innova cannot go through Kufri hills. No drive to Chail as per the MMT plan c.  Day-3 we had to start at 6AM(No break fast was availed as travel time would not have been sufficient if we had break fast) and again we were misguided by driver. I think he got lot of connections with local vendors. Made us shop at some shop where we spent 9K. Travel of 10 hours d.  Day -4: As per MMT plan we were supposed to go to Manikaran, Driver suggested Rohtang pass though there was no entry approved. He charged extra 3K for taking us to Ghulaba was the near point to Rohtang. He took us to Solan which was on our request. e.  Day-5: As per MMT plan it was supposed to Naggar sight seeing. When we asked about Manikaran, he said road was damaged and the same hot springs are available at vashisht temple. Hidimba temple also was shown. Though there was parking available nearby to Vashisht and HIdimba and lot of cars were seen near by the places. Due the vehicle condition driver was leaving us to the fartest possible points where we had to walk at least 2-3 kilometers TO-FRO to reach the car and the points. f.  Day -6: Driver asked us to leave by 5AM as it would take time to reach Delhi. This day we were supposed to visit Vashist and Hidimba and enroute to Delhi Driver insisted that MMT plan was not accurate and travel time would be at least 13 hours. We again skipped break fast at Manali hotel and started to Delhi at 5AM. g.  Day-7: Driver told as it was hot in Delhi and nothing much was to be seen during the day. If we paid him 12500Rs he would take us to Agra and Madhura. He promised that he would show us Akshardham too on the same day. He also told that as diesel cars were not allowed on Delhi roads and another Innova car with Petrol/CNG would be sent to us next day. We paid him the 12500 and visited Agra(TAJ) and Madhura and nothing in Delhi was covered and driver promised that we can start early at 7AM next day and can cover everything on the same day. h.  Day – 8: we were supposed to start for Delhi sightseeing as nothing was covered by 7AM. No one turned up and after multiple calls to travel agents, driver we were sent a dzire car at 11AM. Waited for 4 hours in the hotel and was said car was stuck in traffic and will be sent. Car sent was from another travel agent in the same street and neighbor shop and it was evident that all the excuses of traffic and car started from 8AM was false. i.  It was written in the confirmation that All transfers by AC Innova and Entrance fee at all monuments were included. We got a faulty vehicle to start with and Dzire in Delhi and had to pay for all monuments as driver said he was not told to pay. I am not sure if the Driver was wrong or MMT planning was disastrous, but as a whole we suffered lot of physical and mental agony and though escalated to MMT no responses from MMT. We will go to consumer court/forum due the distress and stress we have faced due to this trip",1

1878,"Hi Guys, So I recently was planning to visit my home town and was looking for a round trip from Pune to Hyderabad. As I wanted To stay more time at my home, I decided not to waste much time on travel. So, here enters makemytrip.com, I have heard so many positive reviews about them and now was the time to give it a try. As, I was first time user of MMT I was given 400 off on my itinerary. I was booking Indigo flight for both sides. Even with the discount my trip cost came to 4200. I was quite happy, as it was not so expensive. Just before paying the amount I thought lets check Indigo website. I opened the Indigo website and found the price of the ticket to be cheaper than MMT, convenience fee also less by Rs.50 Indigo didnot offer any discount to me, still the amount came around 3800. I was much excited that I saved 400Rs. So, guys just think before you buy anything.",3

These three interacted with ""Make My Trip"" executive Madhuri for over four months and Made this dream tour possible.It was meticulously executed by Mr. Ashir the Tour manager who appeared very strict on the face but was punctual and professional in his approach without which we would not have covered so many places in such a small duration at a throw away price. The journey started from Paris France covering Eifel Tower, Arch de Trimph, and Chapels and museums and proceeded towards Brucells Belgium where we saw different types of palaces and monuments, Autominium. From there on we went to Amsterdam Netherlands to see an enchanting, scenic and colourful  Tulip Garden and had a cruise on river Amstel which criss cross the city. Then went to the historical city Cologne Germany with wonderful structures including Cologne Cathedral and visited Black Forest to have a view of the making of the world famous Coockoo Clocks. Our next visit was to Zurich Switzerland founded by Romans during 15 Bc. It has St. Peters Church and the world famous ETH University whose Allumini include Albert Einstein, John Paul Newmann the father of computer algorithms. From here on we went to Interlakenhoheweg city after visiting the city of Lucerne with its famous carvings of dying Lions. The Interlakenhoheweg is a must see place for Indians as the statue of late Yashchopra is erected there naming him as the Brand Ambassador of the city for making Alps valley popular for Bollywood film shooting. Then went to Engleberg and participated in an Indian Disco. Next morning visited the snow clad Mt. Titilis via three different modes of cable cars including a Revolving one. Our next destination was Milano Italy where we saw the statue of Leanardo da Vinci the man who painted Monalisa and Last Supper. We could not see the painting of last supper painted on the wall of the Chapelas it was fully booked. Had an Orientation tour of Milano the fashion hub of the world covering ""Gallerio Vittorio Emanule"" a double Arcade glass vaulted Structure, through various modes of transport, Metro, Tram and Taxi. Had a taste of Italian Pizzas. Finally we left Milano Airport and and even after reaching Bangalore from where we started, we still continue to dream the events, the sceneries, the people, places etc. etc. If a SWOT analysis is to be made in this case.Our Strength is our numbers, Weakness was the last minute issue of visa to some members, the Opportunity is  the professionalism of the Make my Trip and threat was rain which did not hamper us in any visits. Hats off to MAKE MY TRIP guys including Ashir and our own Amar and finally the ever Energitic  ""BANGARI"" .",5

1890,"Fraudulent Marketing - The act of purposely misleading or deceiving the public in order to generate more interest or acceptance in a product) LOL! Makemytrip you are an awesome example to prove this definition. What I claim today on this forum is not built over one incident but series of incidences. You customer service is the shittest ever. Make 4 booking and win one night free. WOW and how?! the offer last only for 10 days. You kidding me! I take one vacation and you want me to plan another within 10 days of it's completion. like seriously?1 Then bonus cash back! now this is some trap. I had an opt to book with Cleartrip where I was getting 2000 cash back credit in my bank account, unlike MakeMytrip where the amount gets collected as ""bonus"" amount in your mmt wallet which apparently has an expiry date. well, I am still fine with it . but the real trap comes when I can use only 5% of the amount to make my next booking. So are you trying to tell me that in a span of 4 months you expect a normal person to take vacations every single month so as he can very safely earn 2000 rather still would not be able to earn and enjoy the feel of the cash back. Freak bro! that is some marketing gimmick! hidden terms and conditions it is. Cleartrip and other ticketing online marketplace play a fair game unlike you. Well played Blacklisted!",1

1892,"I am on a holiday tour arranged by make my trip. Starting from the way booking was handled,  lack of responsiveness, unprofessional attitude,  it has been most traumatising experience.  To be honest,  I feel like completely cheated. Their customer care responsiveness have also been very unprofessional and they did not really care about my problem or shown any interest in solving.  Instead, I was given the reason that it was my choice. Overall, I will give them a total negative recommendation.  Please do not book a holiday package with them in any case.  It is not only a waste of money but will also give you lot of stress.  I am not sure if their senior management really cares about their existing customers,  as they are busy expanding new business.  In that process,  probably they do not realize the permanent loss of existing customers and the negative feedback that goes on from customers like me. I will give a more detailed review for anyone interested.",1
1893,"Make sure you have discussed the option to change guides if dissatisfied. We went on a group tour to China through Make My Trip(a travel organiser in India) which tied up with this company(Beijing Top View Holiday Travels and Tours chinatoptours.com). We did three cities: Beijing, Xi'an and Shanghai. Our guide in Beijing was really awesome but those in Xi'an and Shanghai were no match. The one in Shanghai(whose English name was Lucy) was so horrible that the day she picked us from the airport, we felt like asking the company to change our guide. We remained stuck with her for 3 days and risked missing our flight because of her. Below is the letter I wrote to the company but never heard back from them(our of courtesy for ruining our Shanghai experience). They do not have a presence in Trip Advisor but I would recommend using caution should you decide to go with them. The quality of accommodation stayed comfortable and functional but it visibly deteriorated with each subsequent place: Beijing was super classy to begin with, Xi'an was average and Shanghai was below average in comparison. Letter: Hello Thalia/Dora, I just returned from the 9-day Beijing-Xian-Shanghai group tour organised by your company. I was one of the 5 people in the group. First off, I would like to share that the guide by the name of Jerry was simply fantastic as he had a lot of knowledge, was a wonderful, kind, patient and considerate person and very cheerful and caring. He put us at ease right from the word go. He took very good care of us in Beijing. The other two guides(in Xian and Shanghai) were no match for him as they lacked knowledge, were not involved and were unable to engage us, and from what it appeared, were more interested in commission based tourism. The guide in Xian by the name Wendy was a good person overall and she took good care of us even though she was unable to engage in discussion or share information. What we did not like about her suggestions was that she gave us just one option of going for the show(which turned out to be just about OK) instead of giving us more options like walking within and around the city wall. She also recommended a place for lunch of her choice, placed an order quickly without consulting us and promoted the expensive tea being sold by that restaurant through their'free tea ceremony'. When I asked her about tea and the rates, she had absolutely no idea(which is obviously quite surprising). Both of her suggestions felt quite selfish. Unfortunately, the guide in Shanghai by the name Lucy was the worst of them. Her awful, unprofessional and inconsiderate behavior has prompted me to write to you to draw your attention to the matter as it affects both, the tourists experience. She offended us in numerous ways right from the start of our journey and left a very bad taste of Shanghai. We were relieved to leave Lucy behind when leaving Shanghai. I regret not requesting a change of guide from the first day itself.  She was not a guide. Here is what happened: No smile at the airport when receiving. She rarely ever smiled. She had this stiff appearance like we were going on a battle or something. Who has the money?: She was clever enough to keep the right people pleased by communicating to them only: the two senior men, who would eventually pay her.  Other three people did not exist for her. She would start her stories and explanation even when just one of the two men were present(unlike the other two guides, who would wait for everyone's attention). Not interested in her job: She rushed us to the Shanghai Museum straight from the airport as it was about to close at 4 PM(she never kept us informed of this time). Then she aske",3

However, post the booking, we realised that the seats have not been booked/ are not front row seats. When tried raising the issue with the MMT executive(Upendra Sharma) who had made the booking for us, however he did not respond to 3-4 emails sent in this regard. When a complaint was registered over customer care, the ticket was automatically resolved. Reached out to the customer care again and a new ticket with a resolution time of 72 hours was created. It was indicated that the earlier ticket could not be reopened. This is how they are ""fudging the system"" to show that the service levels are being met. Escalation is not possible until the new ticket is resolved(wait time of 72 hours, by when we""ll be in the flight) Extremely disappointed with the service provided. Perhaps never booking on MMT again.",1

However, most of the offers have hidden terms and users are being impacted while they are trying to avail so do not try to do any booking with MMT. Goibibo is much better. There is no customer support at all who could be enough educated all are cheaters. There is no escalation process does not matter how many tickets you are opening all will be open only for always.",1
1896,"I think one should definitely read the reviews on mouthshut and consumer affairs before doing any business with them. They have 1000 terms and conditions that you can't read within the stipulated time within which the session expires. After any small error in your booking, you are basically screwed. They will not help you anyway, charge you for cancellation and will delay on any payments. It took me 25 minutes just to talk to somebody at MakeMyTrip. After 4 hours of frustration, the issue was still not resolved. One thing is for sure, I will prefer to walk before I book a ticket on MakeMyTrip. Regards Satyan",1

1898,"My 1-night stay at Hotel Holiday Inn, Aerocity, New Delhi was a downright TORTURE, to say the least! No porter / Bell-boy to take the luggage up to my room on the 2nd floor Management Policy of asking for my Credit Card details(Card no. & expiry date) was most objectionable & and definite a prospective security risk for me – sharing of such details had resulted in misuse by Hotel staff earlier of another Hotel, as a past experience. No Regional(Zee/ETV -Bengali, Marathi, etc) channels were permanently available in Cable TV in the room - which is absolutely annoying & unacceptable.(your lady duty manager at around 8 P.M. on 4th may 2016 had retorted "" you cannot expect us keep all 5000 channels in the cable TV""!) Free Wi-Fi signal provided was too weak – such that not a single Video could be watched in my laptop – stopping intermittently(every 1-2 min. getting stuck & re-starting) 2 out of 3 nos. power points(for Mobile charging or Laptop supply) available in the room were faulty. Lighting provided over the wash-basin in washroom is sadly inadequate for even a proper shaving requirement.

It took almost 2 hours to go shimla from my hotel. Also in MAnasultanli, they provided very cheap hotel where basic facilities(like toilet paper) were not there. This hotel was even worst than Shimla. This was like a station lodge type hotel. Only hotel provided in Chandigadh was 3-star category hotel and satisfied.

The said bus kept waiting to fill unsold seats and kept standing for 2 hours 30 min. Yes that right. we boarded the bus at 10 pm and it started at 12.30 am. The bus then alighted us again at Kathgodam and made us to sit in a non-AC bus on the false excuse that the bus has some turbulence. Then this 3rd bus alighted us 5 Kms before scheduled place and from there we have to hire private taxis. this 3rd bus told us that since it is already past 8 am the bus cannot enter the city. all the pessangers were cursing the bus owner and travelling agents.

It seems that whosoever wants to list their buses on makemytrip.com can do so, I am saying this as I learned from my 2 recent worst experiences with them, here I am sharing one of them just to make everyone aware of the reality of such bus services, although I had good experience with hotel bookings at makemytrip.com in the past. when you aishwaryasingh23 premium Rs 1400 for a Volvo sleeper bus(attached listing from  makemytrip.com) you expect a good service and what you get is worst service, first of all, It is always a local bus with AC cages( when I asked them If this is what they call as Volvo service they say It is the normal practice in this business, fleecing customers cannot be a normal practice, there are no standards maintained as to proper timings, fixed route, filled to capacity even walking space between cages will be filled with local passengers, it doesn't make a sense when you buy a premium seat Rs 1400 and in the bus same seat/sleeper is sold for mere Rs 600-800, you really feel cheated) It seems they aggregate bus passengers from different bus service portals and fill buses standing mostly at the Red fort/RK Ashram, they won't leave for destination unless each and every seat is filled. There is no customer support available for bus service if you want to complain about anything, it will connect to normal MakeMyTrip hotel and flight bookings. If you call  the listed bus service  they will give 100 excuses as to why things are not the way they should be. Below is my experience in stages to give you some idea, initially I thought writing a review about the bus service but I believe MakeMyTrip is equally responsible for the sad plight of bus customers in the hands of rogue bus services. What they offer as good service is really shitty service and state roadways provide 100‰ better services than them, availing their services is opening a box of suffering for yourself. I would not recommend  anyone to use MakeMyTrip bus services ever. After aishwaryasingh23ing online premium charge of RS 1400 x 3=4200 for Delhi to Jammu Volvo(Heera Himachal holidays) on makemytrip.com for travel with my elderly parents expecting a comfortable journey, instead, I got following:- They changed boarding point from Rk Ashram  to the Lal kila Changed bus to Ashu travels/Cool cool saying this is the actual bus Not a Volvo bus, a cheap bus with boxy cabins(cages), claiming  Volvo comfort, I could not even lay straight on the sleeper(5feet 10inch frame). Not left on time(2 hrs extra waiting), filled bus to capacity, even   walking area filled with passengers, lot of cartage goods from local vendors loaded by them  to save on excise duty etc. and risking passenger lives Travelled from secluded roads avoiding toll taxes etc. Dangerous driving, unsafe  travel in box cages, where you are waving from one end to another, If a mishap occurs you will be left there to die in less known village roads. Ill mannered driver and conductors People smoking in the bus, drunkards were given seats for less All walking space filled with people sleeping there. The bus stopped at 11 in the night for dinner at worst quality Dhaba. I was tired like hell when my journey concluded, my parents felt worst, It took me almost 2-3 days rest to become normal. imagine if you book such a bus to Katra and you need to start your journey further to Shri Mata Vaishno Devi after such a horrible experience. How can make my trip allow such companies listing on their portal without any strict checks on their services? It’s like MakeMyTrip is in nexus with such unlawful bus operators fleecing online customers(Volvo service has to be a Volvo bus). Biggest cheaters most of the bus operator on this route(don't know about other routes), Volvo service is fake they provide cheap bus with cages for so-called Volvo sleeper comfort, I would call it box of hell and   they fleece you when you book through goibibo, MakeMyTrip, redbus or any online travel portal, charge you 1400-1500 for Volvo, when you see actual bus you will find them selling the same ticket@600-800,  there you feel cheated, they travel  through smaller less known roads during the night avoiding tool tax and driving dangerously putting all passenger lives at risk, I hope this review will help many passengers not to fall in trap of such fake bus services. I would recommend AC-2 or AC-3 train sleeper bought in tatkal for much better comfort(that's what I did for my return journey) or If you have an emergency situation don't book online reach at the bus stand(LAL kila or RK Ashram) and aishwaryasingh23 only if bus promises to start on time and bargain the price too.",1
1920,"This is to report an absolutely pathetic experience I have had with MakeMyTrip India. In fact, this is the very first time I am using MMT for booking a flight ticket - I usually use Cleartrip, or our booking agency - saving a few hundred rupees has eventually costed me a lot of time, money, and peace of mind. Complaint Reference ID with MMT: [160414-062444] MakeMyTrip Booking ID NF2291471913548 I had booked an urgent ticket from Bangalore(my home base) to Delhi(for 15th early morning) on 14th April 2016 at 7:35 PM. However, the ticket when issued shows Mumbai to Delhi as the itinerary. I immediately called up the customer care and reported the error and asked for a change in itinerary at 7:44 PM. The executive checks twice with his team, and explains that there might have been some error with the system and any change in itinerary can be made only after 24hours of the data being reflected in their systems, etc. However, since my travel was in less than 8 hours from then, a) I was asked to cancel the ticket and book a new one b) The team would refund all penalties caused due to the glitch after 24 hours c) Drop in a mail to the customer care I cancelled the ticket and dropped a mail to the customer care - booked ticket from my trusted Cleartrip, to avoid any issues again. The customer care responds the next day saying that there was no technical glitch in the system at that time, and no refund can be processed, and the customer care exec had said ""they will check for any glitch and revert"" during my initial  call. After multiple rounds of mails, they arranged for a listening session of my call with them(which I have recorded). In the call, the exec says ""since it's below 24hrs of time, cancel the ticket and book a new one; we will transfer all the penalties due to the technical glitch after 24hrs"". He has also twice checked with the technical team during the call, and nowhere does he mention ""checking if there was any technical error"" later. However, the response I have received after this from the MMT team after all this is ""Based on our investigation, we can conclude that the advisor committed cancel this booking and make new booking and we will check if MMT would be at fault we will honour the case, hence, as we checked logs at the time of booking you was selected BOM-DEL on 15April2016. There was no technical glitch on that time on our website."" This issue was handled by a junior at their team, and I have requested multiple times to connect me with a higher authority, but in vain. I am absolutely sure that this was a technical glitch on their side, since I travel quite frequently between Bangalore and Delhi on work, and it is a no-brainer for me to type and select ""Mumbai"" as the from location. I want to get the attention of a senior member of the grievance redressal team so that their commitment can be honored, instead of blunt pre-written answers to mails. Hope this will help.",1
1921,I had booked grand Europe tour package of 17 days with Makemytrip. certain experiences are worth mentioning We were promised a welcome kit on commencement of tour. That was not to be. Repeated reminders resulted in disbursement of welcome kit somewhere in middle of tour. I was told the package includes insurance. I insisted since I was above sixty that I be insured at extra cost. However no insurance document was handed over to anybody in the tour. Considerable problems were encountered in communicating with the  the liaison in person in company. Either person was not available or was not picking up phone. Sh Moh it Sardana  a very senior officer met us in Europe and had dinner with us getting feedback. All above points were told to him and was requested to communicate  action taken on points as above by email. However no reply was received. The routine feedback department contacted for feedback.I told above points and insisted on feedback on action taken but no communication was received Recently I floated an enquiry for Bhutan package and asked the company officer to send quote and contact particular of Modi Sardana. Neither contact was passed.,2

I always found their service to be hassle free. Discounts, range and quality of hotels have always been the best. I love this site and would definitely recommend them to my friends and relative recently I book hotel its around rs2400 per night I got it only rs900 it discounted 1500 its really awsm",4
1923,It is the first website started in India for a tour in our outside India. It was very famous when it was started. But due to increasing competition it loosed it dignity. It is very costly and the facilities and services it provide is not worth it. Even the confirmation from make my trip comes after a week. The services are very slow. The staff and manager working here is very harsh an rude. Even the online website takes more time to open. Now its totally a waste of time to visit this website as the charges have been doubled. They just tell that they will show this much places but at the end of tour you have ended with seeing less places. I just suggest you not to choose this website for trip.,1

1925,"I had a very bad experience not once but twice with MakeMyTrip.com. Recently we were a group of 15 people going to Andaman and we did all the logistics through makemytrip.com. Our entire trip got screwed because of makemytrip.com. The very first day the problem started. After arriving at Port Blair we went to our hotel(TSG Grand) to check-in to find our booking not there and had to be accommodated in some other Hotel. Makemytrip.com package included all 3 meals but we had to pay for our own lunch in at least 4 places. The service from Makemytrip.com was bad as well. We had requested for Private Jetty for all intra transfer among islands, but they booked government ferry for 2 islands. Overall the experience has been pretty bad and the entire group decided not to make any future arrangements with Makemytrip.com",1
1926,"My name is Krishna Kant and here I am going to post a review on Makemytrip.com Let me tell you about me first. I have interest in visiting new places and knowing about the history of the tourist places in India. So I have to use these websupports for satisfying my journey needs. Among all, MakeMyTrip app was used by me all first as I had watched an add related to makeMyTrip. Let me tell you that what they show in the adds is completely different from their actual service. This journey app provides you several services like booking hotels, booking flight tickets and also for some of the buses where the bus route is available. But the problem is that the service provided from MakemyTrip is not convenient for the customer as it doesnot stand on its service well. Actually I had booked a bus from bangalore to Goa. I got a window seat as shown in the mobile app and eveeything was okey right that moment. But on the journey date, I found it problematic to search for the bus stand. And finally bus stand was about 5 km away from the spot which was indicated in the app. Again in the bus, I was told that I had booked middle seat not the window seat. Bus cunductor did not listen to me and finally I had to take the middle seat. Also they say that they provide the cheapest price for their service but I have found that the hotel booking from this website is costlier than the other websites. I have not found this website helpful for me anyhow. They give you very less cashbacks and the room avaibility is also very less in good and reputed hotels as shown in this website. Further, there is a lot of problems to be faced while payment options as a few credit cards are not registered in it. I think that if you opt for other journey planner webpages and apps then it is really very good for you and also convenient as this one is just like a cheater which diesnot support your journey planning except of taking huge money even for small bookings. As a customer, I donot recommend MakeMyTrip. Thanks for reading this review !",2

1928,"Absolutely terrible experience with MakeMyTrip. A mere day away from date of departure, and I am yet to receive my revised e-ticket. At this time, web check-in has already commenced. Utterly stressed out for the most trivial of reasons at the very start if what is supposed to be my holidays! Unbelievable that in this day and age it would take more than 36 hours and 8 follow-up calls for a ticket to be reissued(still pending, please note!). Who would have thought that a simple flight booking could turn out to be so unimaginably arduous a task! Blatantly unhelpful customer service, highly disappointing!",1
1929,"I have booked a ticket, money deducted from account but ticket not provide till now. This ticket was booked by me with the price which was convenient to me. Calling the customer care I was suggested to wait for 3 working days to refund the amount. I asked to book a ticket with the same price for me or refund my money on same day. But unfortunately both was not possible for you guys(Makemytrip). As a company(Makemytrip) I dont think so you guys believe in customer satisfaction. Just you guys no how to frustrate a customer. Complain no. nf7293971669566 You guys know how to fetch money but not customer satisfaction. Shame on you guys.",1
1930,No 1 service by makemy trip best in hotels and flight bookings saving overall 85% is excellent And some wallet offers while booking flight tickets App is good website is loading slow. When compare to fares other site are better. But using wallets and coupons make MMT better,5

But then it stops. I am not changing the date of my travel. Just a later time.17:55 departure time. I even tried to use the 100 Rs credit I have on my account and it took that credit but would not accept the remaining payment via a credit card that I used previously. There is no explanation that the website is experiencing technical issues with your website or any communication for that matter. And now, I have been on the phone for 1 hour trying to resolve this matter and I have yet to get anywhere with calling in. I have never been so disappointed with service in my life, nor have I experienced such dysfunctional operations. I will NEVER use such service again, and I will be sure to communicate to all my friends and family .",1

1933,"Makemytrip doesn't need any introduction as it is very famous booking site. They offer booking across all travel related works like flight, hotel, packages, etc. The site & offers they provide are very good. However, I am very disappointing with the reduction of wallet use with respect to flight booking. It was reduced very much since beginning. Also they claims to ressolve the queries within 72 hrs or something but that was pathetic as I need to do constant follow up to claim back my cash back & that too for so many days.",3
1934,Pointless booking flight tickets here as the timings get changed every now and then.and when it comes to refund you don't get the full refund and they adjust it with the cashback which is received by the user. Why do they allow airlines to change the flight timings even after booking a round trip.customer service is pathetic did not inform when initially asked about cancellation of ticket.Bad service!,1

1936,I had heard about make my trip from my friends so I decided to try it once.i had planned to go to dubai for a holiday so I was looking for a good package. When I found very exciting holiday packages in make my trip.there were all kinds of packages.we chose an economical one and I must say everything was very well organised.we had no complaints regarding the trip.thanks to make my trip for all this and I would definitely recommend others to give it a try,4
1937,"The worst place to book a holiday. People think that let them take some commission atleast we willhave no problem but no every day they are up with a new issue do we just have time to waste up out on them? On top of it they try to fool us by sending higher package cost 3-4 than what was decided and the person who has booked the package does not responds.its not done yet then they make a 9 yrs old child an adult and say kuch nahi hota like seriously. Then they deny the fact I have personally asked them 2-3 times after getting the money. So do you want to leave your lovely trip in their deadly hands, I don't think so. Mere toh majburi aap Yeh galti mat krna",1
1938,"MakeMyTrip is the biggest fraud, They are a thief, they only know to cheat the customers. I would advise everyone to not to use MakeMyTrip for any bookings. Below is the cheat they have done with me. This is in reference to the MakeMyTrip Booking ID - NN2304515337916. As per the booking Reference ID, I made a booking for the international flight for Lucknow to Dubai to and fro on the same Flydubai flight using MakeMyTrip website. And As per the cancellation policy stated on the MakeMyTrip website and mobile application, the above booking was eligible for cancellation and MakeMyTrip will charge the cancellation fee and will refund the remaining amount to the bank account used during the booking. And when I made the cancellation also, I even received the cancellation Confirmation mail stating that MakeMyTrip had to refund me the total amount of Rs. 29916. After so many calls and emails from last 3 months, they are finally saying that they will not provide any refund amount because the flight company only provides the cash in the form of vouchers only. But when I ask them that why they gave the false information on the website and sent the mail also regarding the cancellation, then they are just saying that they didn't know the policy of the flight.",1

It will just put the blame on airlines saying they are delaying and stuff. So better to avoid make my trip.",1
1941,This is the best site I had found in Tours and travel bundles. As of late we got a decent rebate offer at MMT(makemytrip) for Shimla trip. We got approx half markdown and every one of the administrations they had given whatever commited. Their client backing is likewise so great and devoted. Costs are less expensive than every single other entryway offering visits and travel bundles. Our gang just want to book our visits and travel bundles from makemytrip.com and I will without a doubt allude everybody to utilize makemytrip.com to make your visit or travel so exceptional. Make my trek is one of the best site to book just flight tickets and lodgings. I have gone to calicut a month ago and I have booked Flight from this site. As I was another client I got some markdown on my first reserving. it is anything but difficult to book tickets for flight,5
1942,"I guess I don't learn from previous experiences. I had booked a hotel room through MMT in New York. There was some confusion initially about the number of days the hotel room was made available and I should have seen this coming then and there. But, I decided to go ahead with the website assisted by a call-center executive to make the booking for the required number of days. I was reassured and all that. Then I land at New York only to find that the reservation is valid only for 2 days and not for 3 days that I had paid MMT for. I then pay from my pocket to get an extra day, I called MMT in India to complain and lost a lot of money on the telephone calling them from the US. I was assured, I would be refunded the amount I had spent the moment I got back. But that is now 7 months since that episode and not a penny has been refunded and I am left chasing all and sundry for that refund. Their processes really suck and they simply don't treat their customers well. I have hence decided to not use MakeMyTrip ever again.

There is no other website which gives best price then makemytrip. you can also avail the extra discounts by referring your friends and family and for every sign up you get great wallet cash and at the time of paying you can get it subtracted from your total amount.

1945,"Had booked a trip to Andaman with family, from 21st to 26th Jan, 2016. Paid in full, all confirmations received, including hotel, flight, food and cab. MMT booking id IN1601B8S036212. We had a booking with J Hotel, Port Blair from 24th to 26th Jan, among other bookings. To our surprise, when we reach the hotel on 24th evening, we are told at the reception that there is booking for only 1 room(we had booked two rooms as we were 4 people). Since the hotel was already booked, we were left to fend for ourselves. We discovered, when we checked with the hotel, that MakeMyTrip(mmt) had requested for only one room. We were back from Havelock, so carrying all our luggage - we were 4 people on phone and e-mail for the next four hours to try and resolve, finally when we got two rooms at a separate hotel. Also, we were not told that for Neil Island trip, we had to book an overnight stay. We had planned to reach during the day and leave in the evening - on reaching Havelock, we found that the ship for day travel was not available. One of the local contacts said that this development was more than 50 days back - our mmt spoc admitted that this was indeed a miss. We had to settle for North Bay Island, which we felt was completely a waste of time. Have been a great fan of mmt for long - have lost the faith, planning for the next Europe trip and this time going to book myself. If we have to check all hotel and flight bookings with the companies themselves, guess it makes sense on doing the booking ourselves. best regards, Bhaskar",2
1946,"I would like to bring forward my experience with MakeMyTrip which shows how this company is breaching customer's trust: Me and my wife planned to spend our anniversary weekend in Pondicherry, so, booked a Club Mahindra hotel for 3 nights from MakeMyTrip app and got confirmation vouchers. Next day, we got mail from MakeMyTrip that there was some technical glitch(pricing error) at the time of booking and we need to either cancel it or take their special offer(which was actually not so special). We didn't agree to it as it looked like breach of customer trust, so, asked for their policy and if this technical glitch is already made public(through net or media). But MakeMyTrip is not looking to make it public and was fine with acceptance in mail only. As we didn't trust the company we didn't give our consent for which they went ahead and cancelled our booking quite aggressively. I requested their CEO(Mr. Deep Kalra) in email to look into the matter urgently but didn't get any response from him but their management conveyed us that they can't do anything on this and their decision is final. Please note that it is NOT matter of money but of sheer control with no accountability these eCommerce companies wanted to have over customers. We can feel that even if you've confirmed booking through MakeMyTrip we can get mail anytime that it is not yet confirmed. Had MakeMyTrip accepted their technical glitch publicly I would have given my consent for cancellation. I can understand it would raise question over their quality and services but if they're really ethical and gutsy then they should.",1

When I raised this matter via telephone to the customer care of makemytrip. I was shocked on such a reluctant reply of theirs that due to their fault, the room was actually not booked as the rooms are already sold out.They did not even take the pain of informing me this earlier.

1950,"“MAKE MY TRIP” IS “MAKE MY TRAP”: Please do not book your flight tickets through ""MakeMyTrip.com"". They have a software platform wherein once you finish booking, a message will pop-up ""Oops something went wrong! Sorry your ticket could not be booked"". Then you will repeat the booking again. The second attempt will yield result and PNR will be generated. But money will be debited two times to your bank/credit card/debit card account for the same journey. This happened to me on 24th February, 2016, when I booked online. More over, the Air Pegasus slot suggested by “Make my trip” in one sector as the cheapest deal, cancelled their flight unexpectedly stranding me and forcing me to look for a costlier Jet Airways Flight in the same sector. The whole episode happened when I booked Kolkata -Mumbai- Mangalore and Mangalore-Bangalore-Kolkata on the fateful date for the next day’s journey. The Airlines involved were Jet Airways, Spice Jet and Air Pegasus. I lost Rs.21000/-. I had to book ticket in Jet airways for the Mangalore-Bangalore sector afresh! Since 25th February I have been talking to their call centre and writing to them. BUT OF NO AVAIL. I got system generated reply to my online complaint. They are not in a mood to give my money back and are fooling me by delay tactics. I am going to register a Police Complaint on 25th March after their second deadline to resolve the issue ends!

I cancelled both the tickets but refund amount only 800/- from 3200/-. Because within 24 hour no return in 1st ticket and 50% refund in return ticket. I do not want to give any star to it but to show poor, given 1 star. I do not recommend any one to use makemytrip.com",1
1952,"17.03.2016 To, Shri. DEEP KALRA, Chairman & Group CEO MAKE MY TRIP.COM SUB: MY BOOKING ID NO. IN 1601B8S099463 Respected Sir, I booked my holidays through Make My Trip from 08.03.2016 to 17.03.2016 and experienced dreadful / horrible & unpleasant holidays during our entire stay. I would like to share my experience with you and I am not interested in apology from you but want compensation for the trouble/Mental anguish/torture given to me & my family. My first interaction was with Ms. Shivani Tandon, Travel Expert, 0124- 4859756/extn. 3839. This lady is most incompetent/incapable/hopeless and not fit to become Travel Expert. She does not have any knowledge of hotels/ places / distances/ condition of the hotels etc. Lacking expertise in travel industry. When I contacted her on 11th Jan., 2016, I explained her my requirements, travel plan, my preferences of hotel, our comfort zone, our age etc. It was specifically/repeatedly told to her that since I will be travelling with my wife and other couple(in all four persons), I need hotel with four star facilities regardless cost. Ms. Shivani Tandon arranged my holiday booking for the period 08.03.2016 to 17.03.2016(Nine nights & ten days) i.e. from Mumbai to Amritsar to Dalhousie to Dharmashala to Chandigarh to Mumbai with hotel stay at Amritsar, Dalhousie, Dharmashala & Chandigarh. She had also booked my air tickets from Mumbai to Amritsar & from Chandigarh to Mumbai. She had arranged car for travel from Amritsar to Dalhousie to Dharmashala to Chandigarh. She had also planned our itinerary for all the places. My Mumbai to Amritsar flight was booked through Spicejet and Chandigarh to Mumbai by Indigo. Ms. Shivani Tandon who had booked my entire holidays did not know that we will be carrying baggage’s for our stay for nine nights. Such an irresponsible attitude. While going from Mumbai to Amritsar Ms. Shivani Tandon booked us in Spicejet with only hand baggage eligibility/allowance. This is nothing but foolishness/stupidity. I had to pay Rs.1600/- to spicejet vide receipt no.502541 dt. 08.03.2016. Ms. Shivani  Tandon did not inform me about such kind of deal. I want refund for this entire amount from Make My Trip because ticket issued by Make My Trip shows that I was allowed to carry 15 kgs per person. The car which was arranged for us was without any carrier and there was no space for baggages. At the end, this problem was solved and owner arranged to fix up carrier to his car. My first stay was at Hotel Sallow International, Amritsar from 08.03.2016 to 10.03.2016. This hotel is in filthy area near Amritsar Bus stand close to many urinals, garbage ground with lots of animals around. It was crowded place & lots of indiscipline traffic around. Hotel itself is filthy and rooms were very small & tiny/stinking &rotten smelling. No décor etc. Had problem with their Air-conditioner. Only one person could move in the room due to shortage of space. The owner showed me his e-mail received from Make My Trip where I found that Make My Trip paid him Rs. 639/- per day  for the room and Ms. Shivani Tandon told me on 11th Jan., 2016 that hotel room rent is nearly Rs.3, 000/- per day. In fact I suggested her few hotels but she did not book them. By doing this Ms. Shivani Tandon had cheated me and looted my money. She was trying to save money for Make My Trip and putting me into inconvenience for the reasons best known to her. I immediately contacted Mr. Sohaib Pathan on 8th March, 2016, (after reaching Amritsar) from Operations & Reservation department, Executive Domestic Operations, ext.44017 & Office no. 079-61602510. This person wrote to me on 12th Jan., 2016   that he will be my single point contact and for any problems during my holidays I should contact him. Mr. Sohaib Pathan showed his inability to help me and put me to Mr. Himanshu Panchal another executive from Customer Support department who only apologized and did nothing. Himanshu Panchal started giving me stereo type /standard answer. My wife also spoke to him and requested for better hotel for which he told us that we had to pay Rs.14, 000/- extra for better hotel. I made many calls on my mobile to your executives but they did not bother to help me and we had to stay in such a shabby hotel for two nights. During my stay I found many good hotels around and in good locality which were between Rs.2000/- & Rs. 2, 500/-. My second stay was at Dalhousie from 10.03.2016 to 13.03.2016. We stayed in Hotel Bombay Palace. It was same story here also. No water in the room for no. of times. We had to bring buckets from elsewhere. No hot water. No heater was provided. They demanded money for providing heater in the room. No breakfast was available before 9.00 a.m. In this hotel ground floor is under total renovation and there was no maintenance of first floor. Door locks were damaged and could not repair it. This hotel was also shabby, stinking and poor quality. No proper reception. Receptionist is used to sleep/ disappear in the night disconnecting intercom. I again contacted Mr. Sohaib Pathan who was not available on the number given by him. While I was standing in reception area of Bombay Palace, I found that they were charging Rs.550/- per room per day and Ms. Shivani Tandon charged exorbitant amount from me. Our third stay was at Dharmashala in Hotel Anand Palace from 13.03.2016 to 16.03.2016. This hotel was ok. But again poor maintenance. Poor quality of Pillows & cover/bed sheet etc. Though our stay at Dharmashala was up to 16.03.2016, we left the place on 15.03.2016 and proceeded to Chandigarh. The itinerary provided by Ms. Shivani Tandon says that it takes six hours to reach Chandigarh from dharmashala. But in reality it takes minimum eight hours due to ghat section etc. How can person start from Dharmashala after breakfast and reach Chandigarh in the afternoon and visit Rock Garden, Rose Garden, Museum & Art Gallery. Only Shivani Tandon can able to answer. We did not stay in Hotel marc Royale at Chandigarh because this hotel was very far from main town almost 15 Kms. away from main city. Outskirts of Chandigarh main city. Again filthy area. No restaurants around. No good locality. We stayed in Hotel Hometel group of Sarovar Hotels and had to spend from our pocket. MY CONCLUSION:- Make My Trip is a cheater/fraud Company and loot their customers by providing substandard/low budget hotels. The room which costs between Rs.500/- to Rs.800/- Make My Trip charge exorbitant amount from customers. You provide very average hotels not worth staying for the people like us. Executives of Make My Trip are fraud. They are with you till the time they get full money from customer. Does not know ABC of Travel business. They have not visited hotels personally which are on Make My Trip list and hence do not understand before offering them to customers. Ms. Shivani Tandon, Sohaib Pathan, Himanshu Panchal are incapable, ineffectual, incompetent and hopeless executives of your company. If they remain with you for more time, I am sure you will lose your business slowly but surely. I am hundred per cent sure that you must have earned not less than Rs.40, 000/- from my package paid to you. At Amritsar and Dalhousie, hotels are managed for few individuals who do not know anything about service industry. Owners are not staying /visiting hotels for months together. SUGGESTIONS:- Make My Trip should give three different set of hotels with different cost. Customer will then have choice to select from list of hotels. One executive should be available to help in emergency. When you plan customized tour, how can you plan tour to your benefits financial wise and not to the satisfaction of customer. When we had given you all the details of the age etc. then how can you place us at inconvenient place, unhygienic environment, without proper facilities etc. I kn",1
1953,"Our long awaited Christmas holidays 2015 were about to start. I, my wife and our 2 year daughter were too excited. We had booked our trip through Make my Trip long back to get our reservations done for Bangalore-Mysore-Ooty which included transfers by taxi. As every tourist we too thought that next five days would be full with enjoyment and fun. Our flight had to take-off on 25th Dec 2015 from Delhi and we spent our first day in Bangalore and second day in Mysore visiting tourist places. Day 3, Dec 27, 2015 our excitement was too high as we had to travel to our most awaited destination Ooty from Mysore but never though it would change me and my family lives forever. I still remember the time, it was 12:30 pm; Guess what? Our driver who was appointed by Make My Trip was driving too fast and in spite of our warning he still continued the same, and in overconfidence while overtaking he didn’t notice bus coming from opposite direction. ALAS, our taxi was hit by that bus. I was badly injured in that fatal accident and got unconscious instantly. 5 days I was lying in ICU unconscious fighting for life. When I got conscious back I got to know my whole face was completely shattered having multiple facial fractures and my left hip got damaged completely. Firstly I inquired about my wife and my 2 years daughter. Were they safe? Were they fine? I couldn’t speak, I couldn’t see, I was in pain just screaming through my gestures and asking I want to meet them. Luckily my wife and daughter were safe. My wife told me whole story about what happened in last 4 days later on. Immediately after the accident, seeing me lying unconscious, my wife started screaming for help. Taxi driver was safe but Instead of helping my wife, he escaped from the scene.  Since we had no one locally whom my wife could call for help she called my parents in Punjab immediately and crying explained about the incident. She was just surrounded by strangers screaming and feeling helpless. Thanks to that stranger who had called the ambulance immediately and in no time, I was rushed to nearby hospital. As our family members came to know, immediate arrangements were made for them travel to Mysore. It took them 1 day to reach Mysore in hospital where I was lying unconscious since there was no direct commuting. Everyone was praying for my survival. There were two surgeries required, one for face and other one for hip. There has been huge blood loss from my body. Everyone was tensed. On 28th, I had my face surgery which lasted for 6 hours. On 30th, I underwent surgery of my hip. Till now I have been on ventilator fighting for my life in ICU. It was on 31st that I gained some consciousness; everyone was relaxed as I was alive. It was my daughter’s 2nd birthday but she was in so much trauma that she started crying and just kept praying to God for wellbeing of her father. As days went on, my condition improved bit by bit. After 20 days I was back to my home town in Punjab, my family being eagerly waiting for me all through this time. Though for first few days my wife used to get calls from head office of Make my Trip if any help is required, but when she(my wife) asked for help(arranging air tickets back home etc), Make my Trip  officials stopped talking. Seems like, calls were just made for the name sake. Soon we understood that why will Make my Trip ever bother as they have taken all money well in advance? We were right. Make my Trip never ever bothered to call us and feel sorry about this accident. Life of a common man is so cheap for them I think. Because of small mistake of taxi driver; me and my family’s life is ruined physically, mentally and financially. It’s going to be 3 months now, and I am still on bed as still there are defects which are left for healing. Every new day it’s a new challenge for me to cope with my body. I am still struggling to live my second life. I am publishing this story to create awareness among society as we pay everything upfront to these travel agents, but if anything goes wrong, these people don’t turn up for any help. Should they not come forward and help customers like us. Have these travel agents turned so in-human. These are some of questions that still remain unanswered. So beware when you book your next vacation.",1

1958,"MAKE MY TRIP’s BLUNDER – ISSUE OF FALSE TICKETS Booking ID-IN1601B8S147513 Ref ID 160226-053487 PASSENGERS BE AWARE OF “MAKEMYTRIP-INDIAN ONLINE TRAVEL COMPANY” After booking you may not be allowed to travel on the date issued by MAKEMYTRIP. Yes, this happened with my international flight booking to Singapore. They spoiled my entire schedule of the trip. I have booked 2 round way tickets to Singapore through make my trip on 16th Jan 2016(2 tickets). They(Mr. Somyabrata Banerjee of MAKEMYTRIP) sent an e-ticket which stated that our date of journey is on 26th Feb 2016 by tiger airways return on 13th March 2016 from Singapore. But on 26th Feb 2016, when I approached the check-in counter in Hyderabad International Airport, to our shock we came to know that our names were not there in passengers list whereas I was having the ticket issued by make my trip for 26th February, 2016. Through the Tiger Airways authorities, it came to our knowledge that our tickets were booked for 13th Feb. They have shown us our names in the passengers list of 13th Feb 2016. Then I came to know that MAKEMYTRIP has issued false tickets. When I called the customer care of MAKEMYTRIP, I did not get any response to my repeated calls. With a lot of mental stress, I had to adjust my prearranged programmes and had to purchase fresh tickets spending double the amount for next day(27th Feb 2016) in order to go to Singapore urgently. I toured more than 25 countries but this is my first terrible experience with MAKEMYTRIP. Inspite of repeated calls, I have been receiving just an email asking us to wait for 24 hours to solve the issue. I have been receiving the same email since long as detailed below: 1st email received on 27.02.2016-Response by Neha Sharma 2nd  received on 28.02.2016-Response by Raju Yadav 3rd received on 01.03.2016-Response by Kialsh Bhatiyani 4th received on 02.03.2016-Response by Gaurav Kumar 5th received on 03.03.2016-Response by Amninder Singh 6th received on 04.03.2016-Response by Rahat Sharma 7th received on 07.03.2016-Response by Raju Yadav 8th received on 08.3.2016-Response by Suman Suman 9th received on 09.03.2016-Response by Urvashi Tripathi 10th received on 10.03.2016-Response by Nipika Malhotra 11th received on 11.03.2016-Response by Urvashi Tripathi) I am fed up with the same repeated mails which are useless to read and to respond. I am back from my Singapore trip, yet this crucial problem is unresolved. This shows the UNPROFESSIONAL, NEGLIGENT AND IRRESPONSIBLE attitude of MAKEMYTRIP towards its customers. DATTATRAYULU J",1
1959,"No doubt this is wonderfull site for travel bookings but if you want to contact customer care for any help, you need about 30-40 mits. and your mobile bill more than that booking.  I book my tickets, hotels on MMt but everytime I in trouble if I want any changes and amendment. there is no direct single  contact no and gfirst you have to listen long advertisements when u call MMT. this is simply very painfull when you need help but you listen only computer sound of MMT ads.",1

1964,"Dear all, its a real scenario with one of my friend. He booked international flight ticket to Kathmandu but got cancelled by the airlines and he told to get back his refund in 5 to 7 working days. The bookings were done through make-my-trip so they promised the refund within 7 days but still from the last one month he is waiting for their reply. He did not got his refund and whenever he call to Make My Trip they have a different excuse. Personally I have tried to book ticket through ""Make My Trip""  its not easy to compete with their price with the comparison of others.",3
1965,"Very cosy and comfortable resort with modern amenities. Has tented, std rooms &  deluxe rooms accommodation to suit all budgets This was actually a private villa which has now been converted into a resort. The place is away from the maddening crowd and there is surprisingly large open area for just relaxing under the trees and soaking in the panoramic view of the Himalayas. The place has a small staff but they were very polite and helpful and even arranged a bonfire for us on one of the terraces. The only thing missing is a regular restaurant, but the in-house kitchen provided good meals and simple snacks on demand. An ideal place for an extended stay because of the natural surroundings. Trip to nearby motorable Auli is awesome with adventure sports, trekking routes, majestic trolley ride, picnics.Kids just don't want to leave place. If you are looking for a quite holiday with your family, this is the place. Virgin treks are all around. Access is by Car, train+Bus/Jeep. Unforgettable lifetime experience! All we have to do is to make a call & every detail is taken care of.",4
1966,Make my trip is a company which provides travel packages for both within india and international trips. They provide a proper itinerary and various budgets package to choose from. The travel from booking made by them is very proper and their is no problem on the way. We booked from Kolkata to Shimla and was very happy with the trip. There was no problem on the way as everything was pre booked. The driver was very good and had full knowledge of everything and we dis not face any problem. The customer service of the company is very good and they themselves call and mail to provide the details. They provide the hotels and cars as per your convinience. If you want any star hotel from 3* to 5* they will do the booking and will mail you the details. You just need to have the print outs for all those and show it to your hotels. I am very happy with the services provided by them and will always book them for my next trips and will recommend it to all.,4

I booked Goa holiday package for 5 days and 6 nights.It was great experience of their service through out our journey.We got driver cum guide so it was bit easy for us to roam around Goa.The car given by them was also neat and clean with good interior.Over all it was nice experience with them.",4
1969,"I logged in to MakeMyTrip to book flight tickets. It has been a great experience till now. No problems! You make the payment and get the confirmation at once, nothing to wait for. I had a cancellation only once. Although I received only half the amount approx(rest was deducted in charges), refund was easy. I also had few train bookings and the booking was faster than that of IRCTC and you have got a better mechanism at MMT. Its quite easy. The only demerit is an extra ""agent charge"" and the time limit imposed by IRCTC. If its not impressive, you can atleast have a hassle free booking through the app too. I do make my tour plans with the help of MMT tour packages, however never got a chance to book a trip through it. Still waiting and would update this review, once I have completed a trip. I booked a hotel once and it was no headache. I booked it and got the mail. It was a one-night stay at Ranchi and after a road trip of 550 kms, I was speculating a little on the negative side but presented the receipt at the hotel reception and that's it. The booking was indeed confirmed.:D And also starting a taxi booking for road trips, by MMT doesn't seem a bad idea though. They should think about it;) Atleast, I can rely on MakeMyTrip. [Updated 19-04-17] The cancellation charges are too high by the way, I end up paying more than the booking amount. They however, do have a ""Free Cancellation"" fee. Haven't checked the TnCs yet. Ahhh MMT has launched inter-city cabs too. I haven't taken a trip yet.",4
1970,Hello All.They are not refunding my money also under complaint no 160207-017662 since more than a month. Just getting useless messages. When status is checked at their site it will show action required from your side. Always better to book tickets from Airlines portal directly. No escalation system provided at their site although they claim for it. Considering sending them a legal notice and asking for compensation under Consumer Protection act.I request all sufferer to expose this company and boycott them commercially.,1

I'm really unhappy with the sort of avoidance they are showing to my international holiday query. It is really unexpected of MMT. Somethings like self serve modes of flight hotel booking are awesome but to book a  international holiday there has to be to & fro discussion and work outs. In past I had always contacted a lady by name Reshma 9611588100. I guess, they are a 400mil company, success riding their nerves, avoidance is obvious.",3

1975,Request if u r nt expert with deals dnt use makemytrip.They have a bad customer support and it is impossible to reach for any resolution.I needed to book flight tickets urgently and saw this offer where u buy makemytrip voucher from their site and get 500rs cashback. After buying and struggling to reach customer care for 1hr I ws told I can not use the voucher now and wait for 72hrs for it to get activated. I requested them to cancel and to my surprise they said it can not be cancelled. I am thinking of making a case as it is equivalent of selling products to customer whose features are hidden in terms and conditions and then using predatory practices and not cancelling it.,1
1976,"This is a third class travel agent with a great name ""make my trip"". The name is catchy but the work is shoddy. Many cases are piled up against them in the Consumer Courts of India for Refunds. It is a taboo to ask for refunds from this site even if the Flight gets cancelled. My close relative was to travel from Chicago via NewArk to Delhi by United Airlines when the flight got cancelled due to a snowstorm which lashed New York and other parts of US on 24.1.2016. Till date our refund has not been processed. Everyday it is a new call center employee who asks for the entire story leading to the cancellation of the ticket and everyday we get a different answer with respect to the process of refund. We are filing a cheating case as well as a case in the Consumer Redressal Forum. My only suggestion is the rule of  ""Caveat Emptor""  i.e TRAVELLERS BEWARE of the cheat called Make my Trip.

We can also book tickets for buses, Trains, Flights, Hotels etc. We can also book tickets for both domestic and international flights. The customer support is also very good. This website contains each detail and description of our travel. We can also make policy on our journey while booking the ticket. Everything is good. we can also cancel the tickets easily.

They just got another transport in simply thirty minutes and we were ready.",4
1985,"Make My Trip, a  team who support to organise the travel, but charges a lot for organising. I had a trip to Shimla & Manali during Dec 2015. No doubt they organised so well that I felt OK with the expense, but if I will compare to the local tours and travels available over there its really double cost. also the offer given by them was just OK. the information about the season, location and sight seeing was not enough. as per the local peoples June to September is the best time to visit as River Rafting use to be more exciting due to more water, apple garden almost at the time of harvesting and Rohtang Pass can be visited. Any way it became a wonderful memory for me and my wife. We could utilize the Winter vacation and Christmas",3

1990,"Abstract: Never share makemytrip coupon which you receive from HSBC by redeeming the points via email with MMT staffs. Even better if you avoid such offers. I had redeemed my HSBC MMT Cred824it card points and availed MakeMyTrip coupons of Rs 1000/- each and quantity of 3, thus its Rs 3000/- but you can only use one at a time. All were valid from 05-May-2015 to 04-May-2015. I received all 3 written in one HSBC Reward letter hardcopy. Coupons=> HSBCM-7F0D0E45,  HSBCM-80D41301 and HSBCM-80FCEECE During first week of July 2015, around 06-07, July 2015. I tried using one of the voucher for my hotel booking. And called to makemytrip customer care and asked them to apply as coupon.All said these coupons are not valid at all.In this discussion I have sent mail with my coupons details and also scan copy of coupon to jatin.arora@makemytrip.com, sumit.kumar7@makemytrip.com and roushan.ranjan@makemytrip.com. I have records of mails as evidence. In a separate, MakeMyTrip has raised issue with HSBC on invalid coupons issued. Nishith.Singh@makemytrip.com and Deepak.Joshi@makemytrip.com communication record I have. Now the interesting part, just a month back(25-26 Jan 2016) I have tried booking flights with these coupon because its valid 04-May-2016. So called up to customer care of MakeMyTrip. The MMT executive asked the coupons as usual and I share.He said last two coupons were already used in hotel booking in Delhi on 12-June-2015 at 2249 hours in Tivoli Garden Resort for check-in date 13th June . Just first one 7F0D0E45 is left valid.Surprised! I immediately used it. And wrote to MakeMyTrip hotelservice about the fraud on this matter. I get response with Reference ID:[160203-042993], as below With reference to your e-mail and as per our earlier communication we have already informed you where the HSBC promotional voucher is used as per our records: 1) promotional code HSBCM-7F0D0E45: is used in air booking IN1602B9S027731 2) Promotional code HSBCM-80FCEECE: is used in hotel booking of Delhi Tivoli Garden Resort for check-in date 13 June 2015 for ID IN1506B2S128138 3) Promotional code HSBCM-80D41301: is expired as its validity must have expired. You see 3) point, all coupons I received with same validity and one expired, Is it possible? Overall, avoid HSBC MMT Cred824it card.",1
1991,"Make my trip may take the credit of being one of the pioneers of travel planning portals/ businesses in India. But  looking at the quality & the ease of the services they have been offering somewhere brings desgrace to thsi title of them. Make my trip always has been boasting of offering the best of the services, but if you will go forward & use their trip planning services, you will realize that they are failing at many places. The team lacks sheer coordination at ground level, which is the very core of their business. Also the price they are charging is way too high than the price in the market. If you will look up for other trip planners you will find Makemytrip's prices are quite high. From my end, I won't be suggesting it.",2

1994,"I booked a ticket for Chennai-Mumbai(return) on the 12th of February, 2016@22:49. While the aishwaryasingh23ment was being processed, their website hanged. I immediately called their customer care@23:01 and spoke to their customer care. Their customer care executive, after checking the backend informed that the transaction has failed and that I should rebook. I confirmed the matter again to ensure that there is NO DOUBLE DEDUCTION. The executive assured me that this will not be the case and that I should rebook. I rebooked the ticket at 23:10. Subsequently, there was a double deduction and both the bookings were confirmed.  Here starts my trauma. I immediately wrote to them continuously for 3-4 days. I called them atleast 3 times. Each time I was given a Note No. to be referred but no resolution to the problem. Each call of mine lasts close to 30 mins. Finally, after 10 days I receive an email from the website that the double booking was not an error at their end and that I should go ahead and cancel the duplicate booking. In the process of cancellation I have lost 5000Rs. I haven’t seen reputed websITES_Company such as these to adopt cheap tactics to make a quick buck. Their customer care is pathetic with the first response coming after 10 days. Everytime I spoke to them, the customer executive would have no knowledge of the previous calls/follow ups. PLEASE AVOID MAKEMYTRIP.COM AT ALL COSTS. IT HAS BEEN A VERY TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE I will follow up with the website and keep you posted on what happens.",1
1995,"One of the best places where you can go and plan your tours. You can book your means of transport and also the hotel room from this website, they also provide very good deals. Booking process is very simple and their customer service is very good. Website is very smooth and doesn't take time to load. Coming to my personal experience with this website, once we went to Delhi and booked our hotel room from this website, every thing went smooth till we reached the hotel. Room which was allotted to us was in a very bad shape and had a very bad smell, we requested hotel management to allot us a different room but didn't had much luck we called makemytrip customer service but was of no use, however they agreed for a refund, which I felt was very helpful. We booked another hotel and makemytrip was very prompt in refunding our money.",4
1996,"Hi, I had booked a tour for Australia & Singapore through MakeMyTrip.com(booking ref. no. IN1510B5S134079). Below is my experience of the entire trip: Hotel Mantra On View, Gold Coast: Firstly, I reached the hotel @ 9:00 am & as per the hotel rules check-in time was 02:00 pm. I had to wait in the lobby for 5 hrs. to get a room. I dont know, if your planners understand a term called ""Early check-in"" in the industry, which they could arrange for if I was reaching @ 9:00 am. Secondly, which tour planner books a twin bedded room for a honeymoon couple, I seriously fail to understand. Hotel Rydges St. Kilda, Melbourne It was my strict instruction to Ms. Suchi to book only 4 star hotel, & by no standards it was a 4 star hotel. A 3 star hotel in India would be anyday better than that. And if you want, I can help you out with that. Secondly, again I fail to understand here as well, which tour planner books a twin bedded room for a honeymoon couple. Europcar Firstly, your confirmation voucher mentioned the service provider as Driveaway, which I could not find anywhere at the airport(as there is no such service provider in Australia). I go to know the correct name of the supplier, only when I called the number given on the voucher. If I would not have a working cellphone in Australia, I would have been searching for the service provider for many more hours. Secondly, I had booked a Mini Cooper convertible & the same was confirmed to me. But in between my tour, I was informed about the failure of MMT to do so. Hence I was given an upgrade to Mercedes A class(kindly get me a certification from any automobile expert that Mercedes A Class is an upgrade from Mini Cooper Convertible). Thirdly, I was never informed that I will have to aishwaryasingh23 a security deposit of AUD 100 before taking the car. I had to borne that expense as well. This amount was to be refunded to my bank account in 2 days as per the service provider, which I hve not yet received. Moreover, they have charged additional AUD 109 on my Cred824it card on 16th Feb, for which I dont have any detail, as to for what they have charged the amount. Fourthly, on asking the service provider, I got to know that the car could have been delivered & picked up bak from my hotel itself against a aishwaryasingh23ment of a very small amount. If that's the case, why the hell was I asked to go to the airport(which was 35 kms away from my hotel) to pick the car & also drop at the same location @ 11:00 pm in the night. I faced so much trouble reaching back to my hotel at that hour in the night. And I also had to borne an extra expense of AUD 100 in this to & fro travel. Hotel Aqueen Lavender, Singapore Again, it was my strict instruction to book a 3 star hotel here, but it was rather equivalent to a 2 star in India(again you can any day take my help in that). As per my understanding, hotels in Singapore & Australia are far better than Indian 3 star hotels, but the case was altogether different here. I hope with the description above you must have understood the mental harassment I had to go through on my honeymoon trip.",1

1999,"I have been sharing my good and bad experiences with all of you over here. Today, I would like to share a good experience of mine which I had while I booked a trip to Goa in 2015 through makemytrip.com. Well, usually we do get a long and heavy quotation for a trip and especially if it comes to Goa(I do not know the reason why?) I had a quotation of INR 33, 000.00 for four nights and five days and that too with air fair, hotel, breakfast, dinner, and spa. Is not it too great? I mean, where do you get all these in just INR 33, 000.00? A big NO to any other web site or travel adviser now when we have makemytrip with us:) Goa was fantastic and makemytrip made is even better when I entered the hotel as I was thinking that the hotel may not be luxurious or awesome, however, it was way better than my expectations. I finally would love to say that I love makemytrip.com and will continue this relationship for long and expecting no hassles in future too:)",5

Kindly don't expect anything on perusing one report as it may be that its been composed in some unobtrusive route in one yet in other archive you might discover points of interest and in other more subtle elements et cetera.

When I reached the place on Saturday morning, I got a call from MMT that hotel has no rooms available so we have to wait till they make arrangements. They said I will get a call till noon. As I already reached there at 11 am with two small kids so I was worried. After waiting for sometime we finally cancelled the booking and searched for a hotel. It was really annoying and lots of time was wasted. We even asked Kadam Kunj resort if they do not have by rooms available then why they  have given the hotels details on the site. They said they have not asked MMT to book any rooms for them. They said they donot know how their names are being shown This was really surprising. Why are they fooling people? No more booking with them. It's better to call the hotel directly and book rooms. Another incident that happened with me was that I booked meal with the air tickets but when I asked the airline they said they didn't  receive any such request. I then paid for the meal twice This is really not expected from MMT for making profits.",1

2011,I think this is the first website that I started my bookings online from. Until then I have been using it every now and then for all my bookings may it be normal flights or holidays. The best part I liked was the price calendar which helps me plan the trips with the best and cheapest fares possible. I remember the first flight I booked through this was a kingfisher red air travel for rs. 2200. Lol. It was nice. Coming back to the website. Now over the time it has improved a lot and is a lot feaible to interact better and search our customized holiday deals as well. With many offers and good customer care support.

Also they have asked me to take alternative hub chennai for the same dates so I told to tell the cost of same package from chennai. Now there comes the real color of makemytrip which they have asked me to pay 88K which is more than previuous package.Reason was date was approaching so the rates were increased but whose problem is that? it is makemytrips even though they were throwing customer in trouble.I will also give you the order id as well which is IN1512B7S165170.So guys dont go with makemytrip .it is one of the cheaters website .

2016,"We booked 5 days package for Kerala through Make My Trip   With a family of 6 people and 1 infant we have to travel 5 hours daily in a cab so half of our time goes in cab. This wasnt considered by make my trip. The national park in munnar was closed, the periyar lake visit wasnt done due to travel time. The entire money was a waste for us. I would never recommend this MMT to anyone. The worst part is we try to contact them the phone lines are always busy. Even if they receive ur call they drop it after listening to your complaint I will rearrange things in following points 1) considering family the hotel location wasn't correct in Munnar 2) while booking the hotel options in Munnar and Thekkady were different. The hotel in Munnar was changed prior to trip while the hotel in thekkady was changed without any intimation 2) The hotel given to us in Munnar was not a 3 star property when it was promised. 4)We arrive to Thekkady on 3rd day after a long and hectic journey of 5 hours and go for some lake boating in periyar where we understand that the ticket counter is already closed. There was no information give to us about the timings while the lake boating was included in iteranary 5)The houseboat given to us in Allepy is not reviewed by any travel community 6)We did not get any free time to rest other than night. 7) With such hectic schedule we did not even have time to have lunch every day 8)the location in Munnar was so remote that we did not have any option of food, emergency needs 9)MMT does not bother about your complaints. There CUSTOMER care services are pathetic. . No quick action is taken. .",1
2017,My booking id is NH7106117112874. The check in date is 11 Feb. I called up the hotel to reconfirm my booking and the hotel said they have not received any such booking. I have been calling the customer caring since 6 pm and nobody is ready to help me out. I had a word with Miss Arpita das and Miss Madhuparana Ghosh. The amount of harassment I had to face is not in comparison to the worry I have been facing for my hotel stay.

A solitary site show all organization's flight charge with rebate in a rundown. so client can without much of a stretch locate the minimal effort flight charge in a solitary site.

After Many complains and the reviews very hard time for getting my money back from Make my Trip, I got till now 37000 Rs refund that also by many times calling and many reminders. But Still the refund of around 31000 is remining. Thanks to Mouthshut website as they helpe to get 12000 Refund more to me, which I got after 3 months of struggling time with MakeMyTrip persons. But STill 31000 Rs Refund is not given by MakeMyTrip and if I ask the details of cutting, they Dont give details, Means for trip cancellation 31000 Rs is the required? So in case if someone Travel from MakeMyTrip in future he should think that MakeMyTrip will not be responsible for reaching destination and if you cancel around 50% of amount will be cut and without any reason. WHy the refund is so less?",1

However post bookings while I was on the trip no one responded. The bookings were done incorrectly and I was overcharged against what was committed by the hotel ne make my trip. To add to this the entire booking has not been added to my account on make my trip which entitles me to some free benefits. I tried to reach out via all modes . Called cc, mailed them, left feedback on the app, got a follow up call for more bookings left feedback there as well. But still to evoke any kind of response from them.

2027,"I had one of the worse experiences ever with them and would suggest to everyone never to use them.  I am a travel agent from South Africa and have been in the industry for 10 years and went to India for business, charity and leisure.  Don't ever use them.  They are a money making scheme and that's it.  Their customer service and complaint centre is useless. As a tourist and traveler to India if a travel agent can't work out how to use this site to it's benefit then I don't know.  We booked a train trip for four and once they took payment we were told it was on waitlist for a train the next day with over 30 people in the waiting list.  We were then charged cancellation fees? For a trip that couldnt be confirmed and we were never advised prior to paying that it was on waitlist.  We also booked a bus through them which after searching for this station for 2 hrs found the bus that was an hour late and was not safe for any human to get on.  it was barely upright so smashed up and banged up you'd swear it would never get to it's destination 5hrs away. The driver was falling asleep at the wheel and the whole thing was just completely scary.  We could not get on this and when we complained about the level of transport were refused a refund and then strung along with countless emails.  Rather find a travel agent and go and speak to them personally as that worked out perfectly for us alternatively chat to people that know the trains and buses that can assist you with booking online directly with them NOT make my trip",1

2033,"I have raised a complaint regarding one of my Bookings through makemytrip.com on 23rd december till date it has not been attended or resolved. I had made a booking with Makemytrip to Jaipur Booking Id NH7115413720194 For Newyears on 1st November 2015. That time the hotel policy or Makemytrip policy did not mention any compulsory gala dinner charges. On 14th December I realised through a friend that there was a compulsory gala dinner clause in hotel Lalit Jaipur as my friend wanted to join me. To confirm that if I would be charged for the new year gala dinner as it was not mentioned in my booking policy as I was traveling with an infant I wouldn't be availing the offer of gala dinner and felt it was waste for us. Shrobna Sen from Makemytrip confirmed that if it is not mentioned in my policy I won't be charged rest assured. I was satisfied but still asked if I wouldn't have a problem at check-in she said you can contact Makemytrip of the hotel informs us to pay for the gala dinner. Still something troubled me I contact Makemytrip one week later again to give the same thing in writing to me again another customer care person confirmed that I wouldn't be charged this was 22nd December or so again next day I called that please give me in writing I wish to go peacefully as I am traveling with an infant don't want a confusion or issue at the time of hotel check-in so this time customer care person on my persistence contacted the hotel. The hotel told him that though it's not mentioned in my booking conditions or policy I still will have to pay for the gala dinner. The customer care person said we are sorry and asked me what to do I said cancel my hotel booking and refund my money as it was a non refundable booking. Please tell me what is my fault in this ? Or if Makemytrip did not accept their mistake would they ever refund my money? The fact that they did proves it as the customer care also agreed that it's their fault. Due to last minute cancellation of hotel I couldn't find a hotel in my budget and eventually had to cancel my entire new year plan as I wanted a peaceful new year with my wife and son. Not party at gala dinners. I simply asked for a compensation for cancellation of my new year plan , charges for air ticket cancellation booking Id NF7203357838313 and NF2203757801015 Now I ask for a compensation of mental harassment and ignorance as since 23rd December I have raised a complaint and till date they have not resolved my complaint though it has been escalated to the management. I keep calling and ask for the customer delight Miss Geeta Eral as the mail response was she was handling my case. Customer care just assures a call back in 24 hrs but since 6th January 2016 I am trying to get in touch with her via email and telephone she just doesn't respond. I need a minimum compensation of rs 50000/- for all this trouble I have gone through with Makemytrip",1

2036,I booked a bus on MakeMyTrip from Delhi to Dharamshala.today. They accepted my payment but said my booking was still to be confirmed. They said a customer officer would call me. Nobody did. I called them twice and the customer officer said if I did not receive a confirming email I should call again in 45 minutes. This happened twice. In the end they cancelled my booking and said they would send me a refund. How can a customer centred company accept payment for a booking they cannot confirm?,1

Spent more than$25 just calling and trying to fix up their bloody mistake and all we got was a trained monkey on the other side of the line repeating what has been trained. The entire organization is a sham which works only on conning people when they are helpless and stuck with suckers like them. I really don't know how and why people still use them and how the f* these guys still have the courage to call themselves the ""best site"". And the tech guys.get your st together and squash stupid little bugs which cause so many issues to the customer.even after not selecting the ""primary guest"" as the one who is travelling, his name still shows up on the booking and that has just messed up the entire trip.

2042,"Hi, We had booked our golden triangle package through MMT from 25th Dec to 30th Dec 2015(just a month ago) for 6 of us(myself, spouse, daughter(4yrs), brother, mother-in-law and my aunty). Below is our feedback of this trip, Literally  we are feeling it was our bad-luck that we took this package. As this is not the first time we took package from Make my Trip,  But this proves to be worst as compared to earlier ones. However below feedback should reveal you all the pains and hassles we have been going through during this trip. 2  ROOM SERVICE: AJANTA(Delhi): After so much of hassles we were expecting things to be smoother thereafter and some how reached hotel AJANTA. in fact Driver did not know the address of this hotel and we had to ask people on the way for the directions to reach. Again our luck start looking other side as we were already tired of waiting there in airport and scrawled to hotel now there are no rooms free even though it was 2 hours later than our chek-in time. we couldn't not see our own pain as our mother and Aunt were in dire need of rest as they got headache.  My goodness I cannot explain you about our wait for 1 hour. Room service and quality of the room was not good. as we asked multiple times to replace the door mat but it turned dubious. Nothing was quick and responsive there . LOVEKUSH(Agra):  Hotel in  AGRA was like a nightmare for us.as soon as we entered into the room it literally kicked us out of room as the room was shabby with the bed sheets so unnatural dirty which  I cannot explain in words . There were no doormats and toilet rolls. even after several requests and calls to receptions toilet roll was not provided. NATRAJ(Jaipur): Not to Ignore the good parts, This hotel was really good and we got a good and quick room service.  I can say this stay was best of all these three hotel stays Breakfast provided was really good and better than all others . In fact we were expecting the Guide all along with us during our trip  but to my surprise I did not see one during our trip . With our prior experience in MMT we got  a Guide with us all the time . Andaman Package. AudioGuide provided by MMT through AudioCompass app was not working all the time though we have downloaded audios of all the places in advance as suggested by MMT. Being new to these places it was very important for us to guide and help us. Unfortunately even driver did not help us or talked to us amicably neither.  This was the worst part being with us for five days and not even suggesting what is good and what is not is really a shock and grieve for us. Many of the time few guide deceived and cheated us as these place were new to us. Can you tell me how this would work being new and even driver with us not spelling a single word about the cities which he has been with since he has born . With this, I am sure you understand the pathetic situations we had to face during our trip. Overall, I could say this was the worst trip we had and In fact anyone asks about this package I suggest not go with MMT. After all these when we had sent a feedback mail to MMT they were least bothered. They didn't even replied a single word to our mail. Please check the people reviews before you go ahead with any MMT packages because we pay so much money and if the results turned like this then it pains a lot. Regards, Anuradha",1

Later I got know that hotel guys cancelled my booking and makemytrip folks didn't bother to inform me.! I lodged a compliant in makemytrip(Reference ID:[160117-026375]), they were supposed to resolve this issue within 72 hours, weeks passed by no body called me. Finally I called them and their solution was we will refund your money. Just wondering how careless they are, they made me to travel so far to find no booking even though its confirmed, on top of that they are not ready to accept their mistake and take appropriate action. My money is still hanging there I wont initiate refund, still looking for consumer court procedure to sue makemytrip. This is simply not acceptable, their attitude is I am refunding your money sorry rooms were not there.

And this was not the increased cost of airline ticket. This was a non refundable convenience fee. This is absolutely insane. You wont even know that there is such a cost involved till the absolute end of your booking This is the most cheap and unfair money making technique one could apply.

They don't give clear replies don't respond to mails. Provide you the tickets just 3 days before the journey, that too after pursuing them n being endlessly on hold.

Also some of the advertisements by MMT in FB shows that it has slashed the fares to Rs. 806 on specific route but when we enter into the website we will come to know that there is no flight ticket with this low fares. It is just the BASE FARE which is Rs.806 and the way they display on the website looks like the whole flight fare is just Rs. 806. It is quite disappointing for anyone who has gone through this.

2056,"Makemytrip app and web site is a fantastic app and web site .Because recently from its app you purchased a flight ticket and you availed vast money back. It absolutely was valid until arrival date. The location is quicker and you observed it sends several sms to verify purchase and sends mail too. The ticket was sent instantly .Even without an ID on makemytrip as a guest you'll be able to purchased ticket .The prices are terribly nominal and also the app and sites show all priced on the day. Like if you go to the web site or app, see lists of all flights between source and destination city . Make my trip straightaway sent you offers for staying in hotels and also the discount is big. Makemytrip even arranges package tour and that I have information the arrangements are quite satisfactory. You can make flight booking, hotels and bus bookings. It’s so convenient and reliable.Please believe them and browse out all information on the site or app before you proceed further.",4
2057,"If you want long term moments from your travel trip, then never go through Makemytrip website or company. They will not provide anything same as travel iternary. 50% in iternary is optional or charges on spot.Makemytrip staff act as they are commission agent. Never provide them your phone number. My experience is very bad with makemytrip. Please go travel through makemytrip Website or office online offline. NEVER NEVER",1
2058,"They are good only to book flight tickets. Just check on the airlines website also to see if directly those are cheaper or not. Use promo codes with caution as they`ll use different excuses to not credit the cashback to your account. With no direct phone support to executives you have no fast way to contact them except social media. Proceed with caution, they already have duped me of 3200 bucks as cashback and 1 free hotel night stay.Be very careful.",2

2060,"I will say NO TO MAKE MY TRIP. I have booked a ticket(MakeMyTrip Booking ID - NN251932820828) for 2 person on 23rd Aug 2012 for Kathmandu out of which I cancelled 1 person ticket for which Make My Trip was suppose to refund me Rs. 9, 886. Make My Trip is saying they have transferred the money in my account on 11th September 2012. There was many trail email sent to Make My Trip for this complaint & each time they say they didn't get the bank statement from my end which I use to send them regularly each time they ask. This refund is not yet credited in my bank account till now. I have been following with Make My Trip for 2 years in this case but still didn't get the refund, finally I let the money being swallowed by them. Im very much sure that they can't digest this money & surely they will be judged for this cheat. Since this on I havs stoped buying tickets from MMT & now Im buying my all tickets from goibibo or ease my trip.",1
2061,"I had pathetic experience for rescheduling the tickets with MakeMyTrip. I had a return ticket for my family from Delhi to Minneapolis and now I need to change the date and also the final destination in US, but MakeMyTrip can't change the sector and also for date change they are providing a very huge difference in the fare even though there are less fare tickets available for a fresh booking. I will never use makemytrip in future and suggest the same to others.",1
2062,"Say ""No"" to Make my trip. They will sell you a ticket saying it is refundable on the phone, after you have bought, you see the small prints ""non refundable"". Their voice mail is such that you will never get to talk to the same person again.After repeated attempts, I was told they will in 24 hours make me listen to the tape conversation that took place with the agent. It is called ""Call tracking"": that never happened. Girls that attends the call are disgusting. International ticket involves in large sum so be careful when you deal with such people.They will take you to another website called checkmyflight. com and create more confusion. Agent says he will book my seat, never did.",1
2063,"I booked 2 hotels with makemytrip on 22nd Dec 2015.first one was NXT Jodhpur from 27th Dec 2015 to 29th Dec 2015(Booking ID: NH2P106211809417) and another one in Udaipur at Shiv Vijay Vilas from 30th Dec, 2015 to 2nd Jan, 2016. I received the confirmation voucher after few minutes stating that my bookings are confirmed. Before starting the trip, I called up my Udaipur hotel to check the location etc and the manager said that they are sold out and they informed the same to Makemytrip but I never received any such update from makemytrip and as per their voucher it was confirmed(I too have email from the hotel stating that they informed makemytrip about the sold out status). I thought that this might be due to any technical issue and I informed makemytrip about the same on 24th Jan. They had no clue about that and they said that they will arrange for another hotels as soon as possible but I never heard from them till 28th Jan, 2015. Before continuing with this incident, I would also like to apprise what happened in Jodhpur, I reached at Jodhpur on 27th Dec, 2015 and once I reached Hotel, they said that they are already sold out and they informed the same to makemytrip but makemytrip again never informed me about the same(even I received a reminded mail from makemytrip a day before to apprise me my about my confirmed hotel booking). I called up Makemytrip team and informed them about the issue, they again had no clue and told me to wait for 15-20 mins so that they can make alternate arrangements. I waited for an hour with my family in my car but I didn't hear anything from them. I called them up again after an hour and the response was same but no action.I called up for around 5-6 times and waited till 6 in the evening but there was no response from makemytrip and I was forced to stay in my car with my family. Then I decided to make the alternate arrangements myself and asked my friend to book another hotel in Jodhpur for 27th Dec, 2015(since all hotels were booked already, I could not manage to book 2 nights in a single hotel and I had to book 2 different hotels for one night each). Once I found the hotel, I received a call my makemytrip and I informed them that since they could not provide the alternate arrangement, I have booked the hotel myself and the person said that they are sorry and they will pay for the extra amount and I also received an email from him in this regard. But they completely ruined my whole day in Jodhpur. Now coming back to Udaipur case, since I had to face a lot in Jodhpur, I decided to escalate the issue of Udaipur hotel and called up the makemytrip team again and they said that they are making alternate arrangements. Till 29th, I didn't hear anything from them and then I received a call and they offered me with couple of third class hotels that I decided not to accept and asked them to offer some good alternates but I again didn't hear from them. Keeping the Jodhpur experience in my mind, I decided to book another hotel in Udaipur to avoid any inconvenience and later I received a call from makemytrip, I informed them that I have booked another hotel as the hotels offered by them are all of very poor quality. The person from makemytrip said that they will refund the additional payment I made for Udaipur booking, I asked him to drop an email to me in this regard but rather than dropping an email, they sent me a msg stating that my booking has been cancelled and they are refunding 100% amount. Then I again called them up and asked them why they have sent this message when I didn't cancel the booking but agreed to the promise of payment of additional amount made to me by makemytrip over call. Makemytrip team asked me to wait for 72 hours to review the call and after 72 hours, when I called them up, they said that booking was canceled by you over call and we never promised of making additional payment and it is not our policy(please note that I have email from Makemytrip for Jodhpur hotel where they promised to make additional payment). When I asked them to provide the call details, they had no clues. I again called them up but they hung up the phone. Then I asked them if I cancelled the booking why they are refunding 100%, why not as per the terms mentioned in the confirmation voucher, but they again ignored my question. I am a regular customer of Makemytrip and never had such experience earlier but this time they completely ruined my vacations, I had to waste my 7 hours in Jodhpur waiting for Makemytrip alternate arrangements(that they didn't make) and more than 6-7 hours talking with Makemytrip and then I had to pay almost double money for hotels bookings. I just want to teach these frauds a lessons so that others should not suffer because of their unprofessional behavior.",1
2064,"In 2015, I used MMT twice, once for booking return air tickets from Delhi to Chicago and the 2nd time to book ""East Coast, West Coast US tour"". While searching for the best price for air tickets, when I thought I had found it for a particular day via Air India, I booked it on MMT. Then, just when I was about to pay, I received a call from MMT, asking me not to pay as they wanted to reconfirm from Air India. I did not pay. Then after 15 minutes,MMT called me to say that there was a price increase of some Rs. 300-400(I think). As other dates had price difference of 3000 to 4000, I did not mind this difference. But I wasthankful to MMT for alerting me before. Next, I was looking for a tour in US. I checked various online sites like Cox and Kings, SOTC etc.But I found MMT itinerary to be less costly but covering all the places that other companies were doing. I had a great deal of correspondence with MMT representativeMs. Simranjit Sidhufor the US tour. She was very patient with me, giving me all details, answering all my queries and giving me assurances that US tour was going to be very safe for me and my mother. She was not wrong.We had a fantastic time on the 14 days US tourthat covered places like New York, Washington, Niagara Falls, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, San Francisco. The hotels provided wereMarriott, Hilton, Sheraton by Falls, Double Tree. A big spacious coach was provided, that accommodated 60 people. Besides breakfasts in Hotels, Indian dinners were provided.There was no lunch. Best part was, our group of 60 people, did not have people only from MMT. It had people from other companies too like Cox and Kings. So, had I booked through Cox and Kings, we would have joined the same group in US, but after paying a higher price to Cox. Now I understand that all these tour companies in India are mere agents to do bookings for US tour.Then in US, they hire a US company to actually organize and book everything. Most of the tourist places of US were covered likeTimes Square, Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty, Washington Memorial, museums, White House(outside),Capitol, Hollywood, Beverley Hills, Universal Studiesand so on. In Vegas, we were left on our own. So we could not see all casinos. To my disappointment, a few very famous casinos & hotels were left out to be seen because of no help from our tour operator. Also, we did not receive our insurance papers for the tour. MMT was required to email me the same, so that I could take printouts. But they didn't do it, until we reached airport to catch our flight to New York. So, I had no insurance papers, all through the tour. But overall we were satisfied.MMT was a great help in making our US tour memorable!",4

I was promised a resolution in 24 hrs and after 21 days they didn't bother to update me . Reference ID:[151209-045622] we talked to Ankit Saini|Post Sales Sr. CSS, we were assured resolution within 24 hr when I raised the concern on social media twitter they said they gonna reach me in 72 hrs. and within 3 mins they came back saying its my fault. how ridiculous! if I have to travel tomorrow, I will skip dec and skip january and scroll down to select February . no stupid person in this world will do this and thats the reason makemy trip gives me for not refunding. had it been my mistake why they waited 21 days that too on my inquiry told me its my mistake. this is clearly not example of honesty and professionalism . now onward I will be smart player visit you guys to see comparison and book ticket directly going to share the same tip to everyone I know",1
2068,"I had worst experience while booking bus tickets to bangalore, charges were deducted from the account but the ticket never generated. I lodged a complaint regarding the same and then booked another ticket over the counter. After a lot of hassle. when I get the reply. all they said. was that ticket was generated . and it was all there. so no refund will be applicable. How the hell is consumer supposed to know anything till he/ she is personally intimated intime. Very good strategy of making money and consumers have to bear the monetary loss and mental harrassment. when it comes to calling customer service and waiting hrs to get to talk about the thing. Highly dis satisfying customer service.",1
2069,"We have done two tours with makemytrip, one for Andaman and other for HongKnong. Needless to say, both tours were just unforgettable for us. They were systematically structured, all the things were taken care of properly and we did not have to worry about anything. From picking up from the airport to the dropping you back, you complete journey will be smooth. The guides provided are knowledgeable, and well mannered. Will definitely recommend everyone to go with makemytrip. Talking about the cost wise, makemytrip and other tour operators have fairly the same prices. Keep up the good work.",5
2070,"One of the worst trips or say treatment we ever received.If you are in the booking process, they will treat you so nicely but once you pay them initial amount of 80, 000 they will stop responding to your emails and always an auto reference ID will arrive in your inbox promising an early reply but even after my trip to dubai has finished, my emails and queries stand unanswered.Also, if you want any customisation forget about it as they are never going to reply you properly and their phone lines are also always busy or again promising for action.If you complaint to their higher branches, they simply do not give up their attitude.Also just for 10 minutes late our cab driver left us and we had to board a taxi for the airport.Such is their calous behaviour. They are so dumb that they kept the visit to shopping mall on 31 december, 2015 knowing that no one can shop easily and return on that day as there are no taxis available due to new year protocols.Hence we got no time for shopping.They mentioned 12 am in itenerary for visit to Burj Khalifa while in reality it was 12 pm and we had to run like kids to catch on time.Also instead of our private customisations we had to wait in cabs for hours to for pick up of other tourists from their respective hotels and we had to take back seats in a shared car in desert safari minimising our enjoyment.Simply they are cheats and frauds, no worth for money.Also they never call for once or pick your calls/ respond to your emails once you are in a foreign land and behave as if you are on a free trip.Irresponsible/calous attitude.And to anyone doubting this will confirm this once they pay their part payment.One of the worst travel companies I ever travelled with.",1

2075,"Unethical Practise followed by MakeMy Trip to increase their Business. We were travelling from Udaipur to Jaipur on 26th Dec. We had accordingly booked our Hotel booking through makemytrip and also got the confirmation of the same on the mail as well as on SMS. This booking was done for 1 deluxe room in Maan's Heritage Jaipur for One Night of 26th Dec.When we called at the Hotel in the Morning of 26th Dec at the Hotel, we were told that there was no booking confirmed against our name and there were no rooms available with them. We immediately contacted MakemyTrip to check and no one was even ready to accept this fault. For the entire day we were mentally tortured without knowing where to Check-in since we had not planned any back-up since we trusted you and thought our booking was confirmed This shows the irresponsible behavior by makemytrip and what importance they give to their customers. I would never advise anyone to trust & dare to book any rooms or flight from this site unless someone wants to ruin their own trip and be tortured like this.Even after continuously trying to call them till late night for clarity the customer care people just hung up the call without giving any explanation. After having disturbed our entire trip, next day they call me saying they are ready to refund the cost and give me an additional Free Voucher. How does it make sense when you have already spoilt the entire fun of the outing.I would strongly suggest not to use this Site for any Bookings if you don't want your leisure trip to be burdened with such experience.",1

Such was the standard of service to the customer who had been using their services for so many years and who had booked many tickets at once in Dec 2014, for family trip. After ruining my holidays, it took me so many escalations to get refund. I had got Makemytrip's service head's email Id, or else refund would have taken forever.

I had booked so many hotel rooms from this website, everytime it may not give me room at best price but their no nuisance attitude make me book from this website.talking about website, it is designed very nicely and load very quickly.information about hotel is very nice with good pictures and they directly shows tripadvisor ratting on their website.they offer flight hotel booking where you can get some good discount.in flight booking the best thing is that they shows fare trend so if your date is not fix then you can choose the date which have minimum fare price.very impressed with their customer care service as well.overall this is great website for any type of booking and highly recommended to at least visit it before planning any holiday",5

I called the customer care again and they told they would get back by End of Day. Dont know what is their definition by EOD. I did not got any call from them. My question is if hotel is not available then how they can give a confirmed ticket?Is this a TRAP to grab the customer and then giving some cheap alternative. I believe this is intentional.

I was told that madam you will be receiving a confirmation mail from our end. today is 21/12/2015 and I didn't receive any confirmation mail. I even lodged a complaint and was told Il be receiving a call from mmt within 72 hours. since there was no response from their end I finally had to book the package from some other agent. I called their customer service and the only thing they are doing is transferring my call from one agent to other. they are not even refunding my booking amount.such unprofessional attitude was not expected from a brand like mmt. For the past ten years I have booked all my flight tickets from mmt. but from now on I will not book anything from mmt. mmt is fraud.  I have made both domestic and international travels from other agents but never experienced any harrasment like this. I warn you ppl NEVER BOOK ANYTHING FROM MAKE MY TRIP. they are nothing but fraudsters.",1

Apart from, I had to pursue them even to send my ticket and invoice. Worst customer service ever, with false commitments made by executives as well as the supervisor. Even their extension numbers are incorrect. And they say they do not have the phone number of the insurance company they partner with. Extremely harassed. I am going to go out of my way to make sure nobody of the thousands people I know use this website and get to have similar harrowing experiences. While sharing word about this, I just got to know that another friend was charged an amount higher than the one mentioned in the invoice. Customers have to be compensated for this.",1
2095,I booked my trip to darjeeling from this website.I found cheapest rates on this website compared to others.The hotel provided by this website was good that too with included breakfast and dinner.The hotel was three star in good rates and good package was given by them and regular customer support by them.recommended.,4
2096,"Hello Everybody there, Make my trip is the worst site I have ever faced. Website is quiet good but when you come to their customer support I think they are king of worst people and must get some medal. I don't know about Indian Operation but their International Team is WORST WORST and the WORST. Recently I booked some tickets from Dubai and wants to change the date change and then horrible story starts as follows. There is no option to do payment online for date change. Computer say they would call me in 24 hours whatif I need date change in less than that time.Also they don;t call me even after 48 hours and my date change gone. They would transfer my call first to local team and then some another team and then another team.I was with my phone for more than 45 minutes and team keeps on changing and some times just hangs up. I checked with my another friends in Dubai and they told me the same story and now using some another booking websites. story does not ends here when actual flight date comes they send me threatening email that I have to pay 399 or my tickets would get cancel.I hope this is not hafta vassoli .From where this 399 rs comes up I dont know . So please please never use makemytrip.com Take some alternative routes. Regards, Vikas Dubai",1

Unfortunately my family experience was horrible as listed below: We demanded 5 star hotel stay during booking and once we started our trip found very basic hotel stay.

2099,"I booked a SpiceJet Bangalore-Delhi flight through Make My Trip App. Booking ID NF7207555172903 The flight itself got cancelled so I booked an Indigo flight through MMT App again after cancelling SpiceJet flight. SpiceJet officials confirmed verbally, and then gave me an email confirmation as well, that they have refunded entire INR 6197/- booking amount to MMT. However MMT has only refunded INR 4997/- and refused Rs 1200 refund. Their argument is that they put in a Cashback amount of Rs 1200 in my MMT account(this cashback automatically expires in 90 days) when I booked my SpiceJet ticket. So they don't owe me this money at all. I wonder whether it's an illegal practice by MMT or are they exploiting a loophole in Indian laws that can allow a Pvt Entity to replace real ""non-expiring cash"" with imaginary ""expiring cashback""? I repeatedly requested MMT to deduct Cashback and refund real Cash. But they have refused that too. MMT is just an agent here unlike SpiceJet which was the real service provider. After SpiceJet refunded entire money to them, do they have any legal right to replace my money by their own currency(Called Cashback)? That too an expiring currency? There was nothing in writing on website during ticket booking process or on e-ticket itself that allows MMT to withhold cash(Govt issued fungible real non-expiring money) and replace it with their own cashback(private non-fungible imaginary expiring money). So what gives them a contractual right to do so? I would like to invite your comments and feedback. Anyone else has had a similar experience?",1
2100,"My Booking ID: NH210626135337 .The booking was ZO Rooms Jambleshwar Temple Candolim. It was Confirmed on 12 th August 2015. Which was 5 months prior to my booking date(30 th December 2015).I have paid sum of 16190 INR. Almost 15 days back I came to know my booking was cancelled because they have sold out the room what was earlier confirmed to me(I have paid the total amount 4 months back).So I have complained to makemytrip about that. I have started  calling them 20-30 times per day but after there was no action from their side. Ultimately 4 th December I have escalated the issue. After that each time I called them they have given me same reply that it will be resolved in  24 hours. A guy named Prashant from stuck team told not to cancel the booking and promised to give me alternate hotel. After that 11 days over, stuck department almost stopped to take my call. I have tried 30 times in average to get them . today when I got line they let me know it will be tough to arrange  alternate hotel, due to price is increased now. I have booked hotel 5 months back. Now they are cancelling the confirmed booking because they are going to resell the room booking in high price. My Question is:- 2.I bought non refundable flight ticket after getting  booking confirmation  from makemytrip. who is going to Compensate that money. Who is responsible for my mental harassment? I have decided to fill case in Consumer Protection Act. Beware of makemytrip. They will cheat you Regards, Pramit Chakrabarti (9008307548)",1
2101,The worst customer service I have ever experienced! I will never book anything from MakeMyTrip in future. They are cheaters & fraud. My whole vacation plan got cancelled and now they are not ready to refund my money back to my account. The customer support is absolutely useless. Educate your employees with proper soft-skills before assigning them to incoming calls! I won't choose makemytrip again and won't recommend it to anyone else. Very disappointed.,1

2104,"Makemytrip user interface is very intuitive and it has all the possible sorting features to select the flights tickets to match the requirements and the fare calendar is very useful if we have flexible travel dates, it clearly states which flights are hand baggage only or Otherwise, Makemytrip.com is an extraordinary internet booking website where you can book every one of your visits or venture arranges either by transports, Flights or even via trains, each corresponding flights or prepares demonstrates the course. Alongside the admission estimations other than it alongside the quantity of seats accessible and it exceptionally informatic for each amateur client who doesn't know anything about booking framework. Over in this site.I had an opportunity to book my excursion to Banglore by means of make my trek and it ended up being a stunning outing and tickets were done and all that much precise, general an incredible booking website and I should prescribe all individuals to pull out all the stops on the off chance that they need to book their outing through on the web. I have been using Makemytrip for quite a long time, I use both the website and the app both provide quite the same functionality which is quite rare as most of the apps are don't match the websites functionality, I have used Makemytrip only for ticket booking so my review is only about that and I would like to mention that I have never faced any issues with them so my review is mainly for things other than those, Its helps creating accounts with IRCTC which is very useful considering how impossible it is to recovery your lost IRCTC accounts, The only problem I have with them is the transaction fee they charge for making any flights booking payment Which is quite high at Rs.200 But I will recommend you go for this.",5
2105,"I am surprised by makemytrip's absurdity, inefficiency and apathy . How can you think of helping a customer when makemytrip can’t help itself . Its like asking a schizophrenic thief disguised as the police to catch the thief. When all the components of a system fail then the system cannot cure itself . Birds of a feather flock together and a blind man can only lead another blind man into a ditch . A basic lack of understanding prevails in this organisation  wherein discussions are futile . Where in the world can you expect such self centred behaviour, arrogance and ineptitude . A booking agent who being a ""team leader ""thinks he is the boss of the company and he has no one to answer to, with a “take it or leave it “ attitude who is unhelpful, inefficient, non punctual, erratic, arrogant and unavailable . A person who promises something and delivers another. Untrustworthy and shrewd . His supervisor who is outright rude and stays aloof and has no clue about customer affairs. Hail solace! A visa ops agent who is unavailable, has no initiative, has no sense of customer satisfaction. Has no feedback know how for customers .Expects customers to know everything . 4.An accounts department who has no trace of payments made under a booking ID. Expects customers to pay for the same flight again and again . No sense of organisation . A website that is non-informative and handicapping .Even though I have an invoice generated of the full amount against a booking ID later the same booking ID expects you to pay the full amount again . BONKERS! Booking agents that make several booking ID’s against the same PNR and create chaos and confusion that is conveyed as tremors to the accounts departments, to the customer care team, to customer, to other booking agents to visa teams . Customer care executives who find it convenient to transfer calls to the automated answering system again and again to keep the customer in a never ending loop and care two hoots about case resolution . 8.The automated answering system which is so tuned that you will get to a customer care agent immediately if you have a new booking but for an existing booking you will have to wait and wait …… 9 . A customer delight team that knows all, sees all, ignores all, is covered deep in the filth of its organisation to think rationally to effectively resolve customer issues .Such is the sense of nepotism and conflict of interest . Gone are the time when customer delight teams greeted customers with “ REGRET THE INCONVENIENCE CAUSED TO YOU” rather greeting them with “WE HAVE INVESTIGATED THE ISSUE AND HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS FOR YOU. YOU WONT HAVE TO GO NUTS ANYMORE. WE’LL HANDLE IT FROM HERE “. If the customer has to get corrected the amount he has to pay by showing and send proof of settled amount then what use are you at makemytrip? If the customer has to send from of his bank statements to show that he has paid for a service then what use is your accounts department, your records keeping department, your booking department(who is made aware of payment at the time its done) and what use is your website if it cannot reflect this basic detail . Who is taking responsibility of the customer at makemytrip? How do you expect the customer to deal with multiple booking ID's for the same flights when these numbers give them jitters. There is no way to escalate, even supervisors and team leaders are stubborn to escalate when escalation is the right and honest thing to do . When you can’t handle things please allow and give an opportunity to someone who can . IT ALSO GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT IT HAS BEEN A HORRID MISTAKE OF ENTRUSTING MAKEMYTRIP WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MY TRIP AND I SHALL MAKE NO SUCH MISTAKE FOR MY FUTURE TRIPS. IF THIS IS THE WAY MAKEMYTRIP HANDLE FLIGHTS AND HOLIDAYS THEN REST ASSURED  ""THEY WILL NOT MAKEMYTRIP “ WITH SUCH AN EFFETE MANAGEMENT & EXTREMELY CHICHI STAFF I DONT THINK THEY ARE TRUSTWORTHY ENOUGH TO BE GIVEN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF A CUSTOMER’S FAITH . WITH THE FEEBLE AND DISGRACEFUL SERVICES THEY HAVE ON OFFER IT IS EVIDENT THAT THEY ARE CHARGING EXORBITANTLY AND MONEY SPENT FOR MAKEMYTRIP'S SERVICE IS MONEY VERY POORLY SPENT . WITH A PREVALENT SENSE OF EVASIVENESS PERVADING  MAKEMYTRIP AND THE KIND OF COMMUNICATION BREAKDOWNS THAT EXIST BETWEEN CUSTOMERS AND MAKEMYTRIP AND BETWEEN DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS OF MAKEMYTRIP THEMSELVES IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT STEADFASTNESS, HONESTY AND THE DESIRE TO DO WHAT’S RIGHT FOR THE CUSTOMER ARE QUALITIES THAT MAKEMYTRIP COULD NOT INCULCATE.",1
2106,I am using this website since 4 months.MakemyTrip provide various offers time to time for flights booking and hotels booking but the main attractive feature is travel package they provide huge discount on them when we try to purchase separately not getting so much discount. Design of this website is user friendly never hanged always working.I think every one knows about this website.They provided right information to the customer but it is little bit costly but customer trust on this website.Its good option for booking.,4
2107,"I prefer this site for the temper of best possible discounts but this is the worst ever site for for booking on 27th November, as soon as I reached the hotel they told me that the room is not available after that I was on phone with makemytrip guys for 3 hours and found that makemytrip guys overbooked the room and didn't contacted the hotel. My vacation was wasted so I return home, after that I told them to reimburse my car rental bills. They told me to submit the bills that I did submit but than also still they are reviewing as if it was a million dollar refund and still I am waiting for my reimbursement.",1
2108,"Although I am not regular a flight booking customer at this web site, but due to good reward points they offer through(payback.in), I use this site for my on line ticket bookings. Last year because of my flight booked( Bhubaneswar to Mumbai and Delhi) I had got good payback points which was equivalent to cash discount on my further bookings, and I got almost a free ticket to Bhubaneswar to Mumbai. As now they have linked IRCTC ticket bookings, so I book all my office travelling tickets from them and get the benefit of instant booking as well as high cash back points. They offer very good cheap price fr flight booking, but the holiday package they offer is little bit cheaper than the local tour and travellers, so I do not prefer to choose any holiday package( Domestic holidays inside the India) from Makemytrip. I used to book round trip as most of time while booking a round trip through makemytrip I get again some more discounts .",4
2109,"For our honeymoon, we booked a trip with to Kashmir with Makemytrip.com costing Rs 70, 000 for 6N & 7D. It also included room decorating, candle light dinner and cake during our trip. However, when we wanted to avail the same in Sonmarg Resort, the Resort manager did not knew anything regarding it. We then had to call Makemytrip where they assured us to arranged that night. Then we did not got it. The next two during our Honeymoon we had to call multiple times to avail all the inclusions, as none of the hotel manager knew about them. They would either not respond or delay. Finally, we had to scream and then on last night the arrangement were done. Highly disappointed with the services.",1
2110,"Today morning when I called for a query regarding the PNR of a friend who is stuck in Chennai, the call landed on the desk of a lady called APARNA. She picked the call and told that she needs to transfer the call directly. When I asked does she even knows what my query was before transferring, She abused me saying ""Bhxxxx Chxx"" and disconnected the call. After that whom ever I called and I told that I want to speak to a supervisor, all are disconnecting the call and just now even gave a 1 rating to a lady who again disconnected my call . Nice going MMT and excellent customer service care. I will never book through you and will spread this news about your service too. Also why do I have a feeling that I just cant be the only guy having a bad experience and rest all are so good. Many other also have told that their CC sucks.Guess MMT made their own people to give those reviews and they are Fake. Also may be the case where kids are writing review to get money from mouthshut.",1

It is also good with low cost budget and reliable and durable. This is the good online site for the holiday packages",4
2112,"Guys, Please do not take packages from Makemytrip, My Thailand trip was really irritating. These people will not organise properly and their team members are not at all understanding. They made us to wait in Phuket intnl. airport for more than two hours. Their taxi guy did not turned up and they arranged some other taxi and their tour guide minny forcing us to upgrade our trip to Fi-Fi island. they should have advised us about such upgrade at the time of booking only. Pick up from pataya was delayed like anything and my one day wasted there also. and in Bangkok they took us for sightseeing to some place where we had to travel 7 hours(to and fro) and we get to see only useless museum where not even ten pictures are shown and tiger park is waste of time. not worth spending 7 hours drive that too when you are in international holiday. They must value time of customer. Their tour guides will not understand english. and they do not explain anything about the tour. They did not tell us about dress code for tiger park. so we had to shell out huge amount on buying new stuff to enter that place which is not at all worth. we took 6 nights 7 days package by paying huge money, in that these people wasted our three days. GUYS PLEASE DO NOT TAKE PACKAGES FROM MAKEMYTRIP. WE MET SOME PEOPLE FROM MUMBAI IN PATAYA AND BANGKOK, THEY WERE ALSO UNDER SAME IMPRESSION.",2
2113,Customer service call center is not accessible.I have booked my tickets from Bengaluru to Hyderabad. After payment is done the pop up came as oops. the site is tired and I have not received any communication for this. 30 minutes I kept on trying to reach the customer service but in vain. This portal has become completely insensitive and has not even confirmed the success or failure of the transaction. I received communication only after 30 minutes I got an SMS saying the transaction failure. I think this people lost interest in business and become completely irresponsible.,1

All three have  transferred the calls, No manager available to take care of the concern. After the transfer, almost an hour wait on the call & it went nowhere & disconnected thereafter. Zero knowledge to the call center representatives & they themselves do not support their company's own emails(May be due to the lack of knowledge). No rep could find the trip details with their company's own'Booking ID'. Customer service department is extremely knowledge less. Lost minimum 10 frequent flying customers for life time. Will never ever use these services & won't be recommending to anyone. Thanks",1
2117,"I used to be a regular traveller through MMT and had a very good impression on their service until October 2015 when I took their Himachal Pradesh package(Shimla-Manali) The package was organized well including the accommodation and travel between the locations. However, the visit to one important place in Manali(Rohtang Pass) was not planned by them although it was included in the package. When I contacted their support, as this was an individual package for two of us, that is when my nightmare started. Their support team turned out to be completely insensitive and lethargic. They neither took any action to resolve my issue nor did they call back at a timely fashion to provide any workaround. The agent who was very supportive, sweet and what not, before the order was booked, stopped answering my calls. This, when we were at Manali, a completely new place and when we had absolutely no knowledge of the locality and the people. While I did manage to organize the ride to Rohtang Pass myself by paying money from my pocket, the MMT team just kept providing false assurances of resolving the problem. After my return, I continued to follow up with their support team - The lady who represented them was Manisha Laddha who stopped responding to mails later. My complaint number 1510200-10910 In summary, I have decided not to go via MakeMytrip anymore, although it was a small incident and the rest of the trip was smooth, for one big fact, that the support is horrible and this could mean you would be taken for a ride(A horrible ride if you are unlucky!) You be rest assured that you would get absolutely no support from them, because they handle these issues remotely over call and after you make your payment, they are least concerned. Maybe, a group package trip makes sense because their representative would always be with you.Nevertheless, my relationship with them is done.for good. I shall not suggest or advice anyone not to stop using their services, as I do see many others posting a very positive feedback. However, I shall continue to write this review in all forums so that people are aware and take necessary precautions. Goodbye'Never MakemyTrip' guys.Wake up or you would sleep forever!",1
2118,"I am Shamil P.S, Here I will share an incident that happened to me when I have booked tickets from make My Trip, I hope after reading my experience with Make My Trip, you reader will get their eyes opened, In all means, by advertisements, offers, discounts, easy processes, and even from word of mouths you will find that Make My Trip is very useful and the best platform to book tickets faster and with great offers and discounts, This is all I also have thought about Make my trip before booking tickets and up to the time a get in the airport. Here I will bad situations faced to me by booking tickets from Make My trip.com; I have booked  three tickets for travelling to Mumbai from Cochin International airport, It was my budget meeting of the company, me along with my collegeus have booked three tickets as it was very difficult to get a confirmed train ticket at that time. I have booked the ticket on 5th September 2015 and the travel date was 8th September 2015, in Jet airways from the Online platform of Make My Trip, When I compared the rates with the local agents at the local market this felt somewhat cheaper to me and I have booked tickets as it a established online platform, I have generated and taken the printouts of the all details. On the bad day by Make My Trip 8th September we have arrived at Cochin International Airport before two hours of travel time mentioned in the e-ticket, we have waited there we were sure this will not happen to us, after one hour we approached the counter with our e-tickets and inquired for the status of the tickets to make a confirmation, when the executive at the counter searched for the ticket details they told us that no details are getting in the database of these tickets, they told that it may be server issues and wait for 10 minutes, we approached gain after 10 minutes and quiried on this issues, the executives contacted with some senior departments and they told us that they have not still received any request and payment on this booking, On that moment actually dont know what to do with, they insisted us to better contact the sopprt of Make My Trip, and they also stated that this issues happens regulary with many peoples, we have tried to contact the number that we got after googling it for 10 minutes, from my memory I think it took around 25 minutes tio get connected to the customer care executives and finally one guy have received the call and we have convayed the matter to him, we have provided the details of e-ticket to him, and he told us to wait for couple of minutes and heard their astonishing music for 10 minutes and te call got disconnected, on the same I told my 2 other friends also to try contacting on the same number and fortunately a call got connected to one guy and we have conveyed the matter and he told us that this ticket is cancelled to some reasons, and the amount may be refunded to our account, we have asked for the reasons and the guy played the same trick that he told us to stay on line for a moment while he checks for the issues, same thing the call got disconnected, we just fed and we have lost our flight after another 30 minutes. This is the incident happened to me and my two friends, I dont know why such big established online portal is doing such bad things to customers who trust upon them and book tickets, we have lost the flight and we have to go by train in local train from kerala to mumbai and we were one day late due to this make my trip.com, even they have not informed us regarding the status or cancellation of the tickets by sms or email that we have provided, some of friends have also told us that this happens usually with the customers whoo book ticket by make my trip, I hope they cancel our tickects and give to other people for higher pricewhat we have given. =reader keep this mind while booking tickets from make My Trip if your time have some value.=",2

When I compared the rates with that of the flight carrier Indigo, a considerable difference was there in the fare amount.

2123,"I was planning to go to Delhi on coming Friday i.e. 4th Dec so I went to JetAirways website but found that 9:40 PM flight# 9W-2850 has been sold out. So, I went to MakeMytrip and found that the same flight was shown available there so I selected the flight, entered details and made payment. But to my surprise rather shock the screens displayed Itinerary and Reservation details for 5th of December. Luckily, I had the screenshot of the homepage of the MakeMytrip where I searched my flight on 4th December. So, I called on their customer care number and narrated the whole incident to Manpreet Kaur, the customer care executive and even told that I have the screenshot of the homepage where it clearly shows that I have searched flight for 4th of December. So, she asked me to share the screenshot on her mail id. Then, she told me sir this screenshot is not valid and you should have taken the screenshot of the booking summary. To which I replied that Ma’am, who takes the screenshot of all the screen during the transaction(I realized that I should start doing this if I have to make booking on Makemytrip.com). Then, she told me(after keeping me on hold for 5 mins.) that I have checked the logs and you have made booking for 5th December only. I said that this is not possible because I had verified the date till the last. I tried my best to explain her that since ticket was not available for 4th Dec so it might be possible that your system have made booking for 5th December due to error or for whatever reason. As soon as I realized that I have wasted my 15-20 minutes I requested her to make me talk to her senior. To which she said that she would open a case for backend team investigation and would get back to me within 72 hours. I said, I have to fly in next 6 days and you asking me to wait for 3 days. When I insisted she transferred my line to her senior and kept me waiting for 5 mins. Then her senior(Mr. Whatever Sethi) who does not have manners how to talk to a customer, started saying this is not possible blah blah and kept interrupting me while I was explaining the whole incident(I don’t know why Makemytrip hires such people on such a senior position in customer care department which represents the face of the company) when I told him that since this flight was sold out for 4th of December on Jet Website but was still shown available on Makemytrip so it might be the reason due to which Booking Application accidently made booking for 5th of December. He said that flight is still available on JetAirways website to which I said that it is not available and I can share the screenshot with timestamp.He had no answer to this. I tried everything to make him understand and wasted my 1 hours that I have made booking for 4th of December only instead of 5th December. He then asked me that he will escalate the case to backend team which would take 72 hours and meanwhile I should cancel my booking and make another booking. I tried to make him understand that first of all it was not my mistake second if flight has to be cancelled then MakeMytrip should cancel and book another flight for me(Not this Jet flight 9W-2850 as it is not available on 4th Dec) third what if after 72 hours you say that It was not our system mistake to which he had no answer. Makemytrip have identified this stream of revenue by duping customers by changing their flight date. I am sure I am not the only one who has been victimized there would be thousands rather lacs of people like me. I think Makemytrip should change their name to DESTROYMYTRIP.COM So guyz please be aware that do not go to Makemytrip.com sorry alias Destroymytrip.com for any booking and still if you have the courage please take screenshot of each every screen until the transaction is over so that in case you also get victimized you can produce the same.

2124,"I will never book anything from Makemytrip in future. They are cheaters & fraud, My whole vacation plan got cancelled and now they are not ready to refund my money back to my account. I have booked my Srinagar package(Booking ID IN1511B6S055602) from Mumbai to 23-Nov-2015 to 29-Nov-2015, We board on time in flight on 23-Noe-2015 from Mumbai but due bad weather flight could not be landed in Srinagar and we were forced to be back to Mumbai. Now, since I diddn't cancelled trip, I ask for refund and they accepted to refund whole package amount but in the form of Future travel voucher with one year validity, I told them I need refund in form of money transfer to my bank account. They are not ready to refund money and insting to refund through travel vouch, I checked on their website they have not mentioned anywhere that refund will be dune only through Future Travel Vouchers. In-facet their website clearly mentions following statement in their policy ""All refunds are processed by the method of payment used in the initial transaction, except in the case of cash payments where the refund is processed through cheque or online transfer."" but still this people insisting for refund only through Future travel vouchers. I didn't expected such cheating from makemytrip for refund due to cancellations from their side. People, Please don't book any Holiday package from makemytrip, they will spoil your trip plans and when you ask for refund then they will make you call 20 times and will hang you for refund. It seems like I paid makmyetrip to screw myself.",1
2125,"We have recently been for a trip to Rajasthan(7 Nov-13 Nov'15) booked through MakeMyTrip holidays. But the experience would rate it to the worst of all I ever had. Please do note that MakeMyTrip Holidays is nothing but a broker between you and Car Vendors and Hotels, charging you some good premium without having any control over the Car in which you travel and hotel you stay. So basically you can avoid MakeMyTrip and book hotels through some renowned sites Booking.com. Car Rentals are in abundant atleast from the main cities and can be contacted through websites. Though MakeMyTrip guarantees you comfort and safe stay, but as none of the hotels or car are owned by them, its just air. Worst experience of ours was with the car and the driver. We were 6 adults with 4 elderly persons. I had repeatedly asked for a 7+1 seater Innova, but what I got when landed at airpot was a 6+1 seater Innova which wasnt cleaned at all from the last trip. Later got to know that the Cab was from Hira Taxi of Delhi. No doubt the driver's driving was good, but we had to spent lots of time handling him and his intentions. For small additional distances, we had request him a lot. This was against what was told to me by MakeMyTrip that car can be used to travel anywhere within city limits as and when required. Most of the time he is seen finding ways to rip-off us by either taking to shops which were very expensive and drivers get commission when traveler's buy's stuffs or pushing guides whom he has contact with at those places. Driver wasn't at all aware of the routes and locations of the spots and we had to literally guide him with our gps. In fact he told us that he is not a guide but a driver. It was height when the driver was caught red handed trying to get some valuables out of one purse when all of us walked to visit Ajmer Dargah Sherif. But as I was with 4 ladies(2 elderly) and 1 senior citizen, thought of keeping it low profile not to spoil rest of the journey. So all the claims of safe journey are just fake and have no credibility. After Pushkar had requested the driver for additional visit to Agra with one night stay. Though initially agreed for 4500 Rs, later while returning back he stopped in the middle of nowhere and says needs 6500 Rs. He know that two of us had to catch a flight the same evening and had no option but to resort to it. After lots of arguments and time spent, we finally had no option but to agree on this. No doubt Hotels were ok. But when driver wasn't able to get the way to one of the hotels, he repeatedly kept saying - he doesnt really know the routes to smaller hotels. The trip was a spoiled one. I got many calls before the trip was confirmed and payment was made, but not a single call from MakeMyTrip after the first payment was made. So, would suggest if you have some time to spare go through the sites for travel itineraries. There are lots of online sites for this plan your travel and major spots to see and activities to be done Book hotels through some credible sites like Booking.com/Hotels.com",1

Donot go for booking international Flights  especially offline booking. There Executives Cheats people saying the by booking tickets at higher prices, blaming there site is slow in updating. and withing 30 mins the prices are going up . when I saw there website for the whole day no fare was increased. There Customer Care Executives Response is worst. They don't know, which dept takes care of concern raised. keeps on changing the teams and holding the calls. One thing coul;d be definitely true either there site is bluffing with the fares lower than actual(nd saying after booking there prices went high) or there executives are bluffing customers to go for high fare tickets.",1
2129,I had done booking on 3rd october. as soon as I reached the hotel they told the rooms are not available after that I was on the phone with makemytrip guys for 4 hours and found that makemytrip guys overbooked the room and did not contacted the hotel. I used my payback points. till to date they have not refunded my points and my vacation was wasted so I had to return home. after that I told them to reimburse my car rental bills. They told me to submit the bills that I did submit but than also still they are reviewing as if it was a million dollar refund. Still I am waiting for my car rental refund and payback points.,1
2130,"This company gives very poor customer service. After 10 calls since my request on FRIDAY 20/11, I still have to pay 4K rupees when changing the ticket instead of the stated 2K rupees. One agent hung up and NO ONE contacted me about the request as stated. The promise to get back to the customer within 24 hours is a complete lie and disrespect to the customer.  yMakeMTrip needs to learn how to treat customers right because they don't care about anyone!",1
2131,"Makemytrip is the best site for booking bus, hotel, train, flight, room etc. at the best price. I booked a trip to Goa last month and it was really a pleasant experience. Site design is very good and easy to use, due to which booking can be done easily and you can understand everything. Features on the website are good, add on privileges are a cherry to the cake. I booked flight tickets and got the best price from all the possible ones. Got my tickets on mail and faced no hassle on booking. Then I booked a hotel which I got at 50% discount due to makemytrip and also the hotel was very neat and service was good.",5
2132,"After seeing several negative review on line for Make my trip, I wanted to share my good experience as I just don’t want people should not take decision on heist. I am not writing this review to praise makemytrip.com I just will state my experiences in form of few points. Domestic flight ticket booking, amazing ease and gave me luxury to choose the payment mode. Gave me liberty to select the flight and timings flexibility to change any time as well as the discount on the desired flight. Timely intimation and well informed staff. Although the small issue here is with net banking, as page loading takes time and giving error but that’s ok because it may be small technical issue. Best part was that I was informed at every juncture and changes which helped me to set my plans. Really really nice experience and recommended That’s all, thanks and regards",4

2134,"I recently booked hotel accommodation for stay for myself n my wife at Coimbatore just for one night on Make my trip .com Booking Reference I'd: NH7118313841052.

To my surprise for the first time in life I had to cancel my Booking due to some personal reason which I did about 48 hrs in advance. But the refund provided was Rs.30/- less than what my initial booking amount was. Wonder why such a untransparent booking and refund policy Makemytrip.com has. Though not a great concern I felt I definitely need atleast an explanation. But happy that I got my refund in 7 days time but Rs.30 less than the booking amount.

2135,"Yes I think that is  what their site should actually be called! Reference ID: 151026-030496 Booking No: NN2303710032460 I had travelled to Kathmandu this April 18th 2015 as a group. Unfortunately due to the earthquake there we got stranded and we had to make our way to Delhi by train and road as our Air India flight was cancelled and flights were grounded. I cancelled the ticket a week before the intended departure. All the other passengers who went with me  have been refunded already. I have  not been refunded for the Kathmandu to Delhi segment despite repeated phone calls and emails. As per the advice of Mr. Vikrant, Online customer care  I went to the Air India Office in Chennai on October 26th to expedite the refund process  and got an endorsement on the ticket that full refund for that sector should be given and  sent him a scanned copy of the ticket endorsed by Air  India with their PNR copy and requested  them to  secure the refund. I have visited their make my trip office in Chennai which has expressed its helplessness as it was an online booking. Still no refund in site and they keep saying they are trying to call me but no actual calls have been made on the number I have provided They are asking for a letter requesting for a refund as well as copies of my passport which none of the other passengers were asked to provide! I certainly have issues providing copies of my passport to a website which is so disorganized! If anybody else wants to run around a merry-go-round as I have  -please use their services The others who value their time and money I would highly recommend avoiding this portal for booking your trips!

2136,Yup Actualy it was winter season so we want to EDM mall for shopping of sweaters their I saw some makemytrip persons moving around and asking for to fill their form. They were offering free couple ticket to goa or some destination. And also their was a lucky draw which need to be conducted at the end of the day. And You know I as being 12 th student filled the form on the behalf of my father and signed a fake signature as told by the representative. This was  like backstabbing make my trip but good for me . If 1% of chance I won the lucky draw I can avail ticket on the behalf of my father as told by the representative. And Do you know I won the lucky draw and reward was nothing and I was MAD. I was about to say a mouthful of abuse but then I controlled because they said they will call me  to take the tickets and gave me a pen Of MAKE MY TRIP. I never received that call. Never expected this from you.,1
2137,"Through this review I wish to pen down my horrific experience with Makemytrip when my vacation trip materialized into a traumatic experience. I am specifically writing this so that other gullible people do not face a similar trauma especially when they have made proper bookings and paid full amount and are looking forward to spending a nice vacation with their family. I had made my bookings with Makemytrip on 11th Oct 2015 and made a payment of Rs.15438/- for 2 nights and 3 days stay at Royal court Jaisalmer(now Club Mahindra Jaisalmer). Thereafter, someone from Makemytrip team had called me around 28th Oct 2015 that there is an issue with my booking confirmation. After making the payment and booking during a festive season much in advance for a property which shows available on your website I don’t expect this kind of call. Hence I raised a complaint over this matter(Reference ID 151028-013745) to seek clarification and confirmation of my booking from Makemytrip. I stated very clearly at that moment itself, I will not accept or tolerate any kind of alterations on my paid booking and it needs to be taken care of. I received a call from Mr. Randhir Singh on 2nd Nov 2015 on this issue. He confirmed to me that its only change in property ownership from Royal court Jaisalmer to Club Mahindra Jaisalmer due to which there was some confusion. He asked me to send a confirmation mail saying that the same is acceptable by me. He did confirm at that moment that my booking were confirmed and its only a name change. The response for this mail was sent from my end accordingly. As against which I received the last and final mail from Mr.Randhir Singh on 2nd Nov at 6.16pm saying he is awaiting revert from his team. His mail did not give any clarity in terms of my booking status. Hence I called up the customer service numbers on 3rd Nov 2015. They confirmed my booking over the call. To avoid any confusion and issues I asked them to send a mail confirmation for the same too as I was travelling to Rajasthan from 4th Nov 2015. To my agony and horror when I reached the said premises of Club Mahindra on 12th Oct 2015 around 2.45 pm with my husband and 11 year old daughter, I was told that I don’t have any bookings with Club Mahindra. We had left from Jodhpur by road and had not even had our lunch by this time. We were at the lobby which was surrounded by at least 10-15 visitors. It was extremely annoying and embarrassing to hear from Club Mahindra that I don’t have a confirmed booking when I have paid for it a month in advance. I called up their call centre for help and was on call with them for 46:26 mins during which period I was put on hold for more than 30 mins by Ms.Jyoti. I made her speak with Club Mahindra team who confirmed to her that Makemytrip had sent my booking request to Club Mahindra only on 11th Nov 2015 around at 10.00 pm which was post official working hours. They were already booked for 12th Nov 2015 by then. She then put me on to Mr.Bhavin who was to revert back to me with my booking status in 5 mins. In the interim I mailed across to Mr.Ranbir Singh, Mr.Parin Shah &TripChampions id of Makemytrip for help for which I have not received a revert till now. Tired of waiting for a revert I called the call centre again at 5.04 pm. For a call duration of 16:41 mins I was put on hold for nearly 12 mins or more. I was helpless and stranded at Club Mahindra premises furious, hungry, weeping and mortified due to all that I faced and finally walked out of the Club Mahindra premises. I received a call  from Mr.Bhavin around 5.40 pm saying that he is speaking with his team and checking what best can be arranged. By now I had enough dose of embarrassment and mental harassment from Makemytrip team and I told him I don’t trust them and am making alternate arrangements. We kept checking for Hotels nearby but most of the Hotels were booked. Out of no choice we booked a stay at a Hut in the dessert camp of Sam sand dunes. At around 8.00 pm I received a call from Mr.Vikas apologizing for the Hotel issues and offering help. By this time the damage was already done and we had already checked in to one of the Huts in the desserts. I categorically told Mr.Vikas to refund my amount immediately as Makemytrip had no authority to take my funds and hold it with them without making any bookings for me. All the traumatizing experience we faced due to Makemytrips inefficiency and carelessness wasn’t enough. We had to further pay the price of choosing Makemytrip. The stay in the Hut was nothing less than a nightmare for us. To our horror we were exposed to various types of flies, insects, beetle etc. Thousands of them in our room and bathroom area. We had not even had our lunch during the day. The food served at dessert camp was horrible. No lights at night where food was served as insects would get attracted. Cold and tasteless food, we don’t know if we ate food or insects. When we got into the room post dinner, it was full of insects so most of our time in the room went in killing those insects to avoid insect bites. Both myself and my daughter were scared and traumatized. This wasn’t just enough, there was no electricity the entire night due to generator failure. We could not use the bathroom entire night as it was full of insects and we were scared to get inside. To add up to the misery, there was no water in the morning. Somehow we managed to fetch a bucket of water. The breakfast served in the morning was equally bad. They dint even have bread to serve us as an alternative to the horrible breakfast as they had only 1 loaf of bread and that too was over. We had 2 nights schedule, but due to all this experience we were forced to check out and leave Jaisalmer on 13th itself. 12th was my New Year and it started on an extremely bad note because of Makemytrips goof up. We were neither getting a stay nor a proper ticket for our return journey to Mumbai. Out of no choice we traveled all the way to Ahmedabad by road and took a late night train ticket by paying more than twice the ticket value and reached Mumbai 14th morning. We went through all this ordeal only because of Makemytrip. My entire journey to Rajasthan was planned very well and all my Hotel stay was booked by Booking.com very efficiently without paying a single penny before reaching the Hotels. But because of Makemytrip, I had a traumatic experience. My trip to Jaisalmer got spoiled and we could not explore the city as well. This was not the end. I received an sms on 12th Nov 2015 which reads “ Dear Geeta Desai, Your cancellation request for booking ID NH210667158437 has been received. The amount of INR 13296 will be processed within next 7 business days. I really don’t understand the logic here. I paid Makemytrip a month in advance for no bookings being made from their end. They park my money with them for over a month. Instead of paying me an interest for keeping my fund in an unauthorized form they are deducting further amount from the payments made, for reasons unknown to me till date. As on date I have received partial refund. The responses from the service team are below standards. They just revert back with template mails",3

2139,"Hi Senior Mangement Team, I am writing to you as a last hope. There are many things which I like to highlight . As everyone know there was an emergency happened due to baba Ram Rahim on 25th August due to which my bus(NU29041991135200) has been cancelled by the service provider. Secondly since my bus for Dharamsala was already cancelled by service provider, as a result it was not possible for me to board returning bus(NU29041991139692). Henceforth I asked for a refund by logging complain to your customer care. Kindly refer below for my multiple concerns. Concern 1: Unprofessional and irrelevant reply Whenever I called/mail your customer care for a follow up, they always gave me ETA of 24 hours. I use to wait patiently waited till 24 hours expecting a sensible reply but after that I rather got a mail from executives stating ""If I am not satisfied from resolution, I can re-open the ticket "". Please have a look the way your executive reply reply to an irate customer. And the most funny part after each reply they close the complain . My question to kind management "" In a service based industry can a complain be closed without resolution?"" I have attached the all mails with this mail. Concern 2: Lack of transparency and unethical reply I have called multiple times to your customer care and asked escalation matrix. But they never gave me one. I have always asked about the ETA, but some of your executives even said me "" They cant commit me any TAT or SLA since by case is with back end team and there is nothing to be done at their end. My question is "" Does a customer who pays for your service does have right to know that TAT or not? Why cant a TAT or escalation matrix been provided to me? Concern 3:Unethical Practice and data forging On your website, a customer can escalate till level 4th escalation level. But my(Reference ID:[170828-029403]) was forcefully closed before TAT time preventing me to escalate to level-2 or more. I noticed the same trend from last 10 days.How can a company like ""makemy trip "" encourage this kid of mall practice.? How can your customer care intentionally prevent a customer to reach senior escalation level? Concern 4: Exhausting and Breaching Service level agreement time and misleading information When you document to resolve issue in 24-48 hours. How can you breach that SLA/TAT/WLA? . If you breach why can you inform customer same? Does customer time doesnt mean anything to a brand like make my trip. Kindly give a customer orientation training to your front desk executives because you are making your customer so unhappy that he cant recommend anyone to from makemytrip. You guys are from big premier institute, and working hard to improve your service but you can see how its been misused by your lower management without your knowledge. Looking forward to hear from you and your kind reply in lines for my multiple queries. Regard's Abhishek 9873969157 8377861936",1
2140,"I spoke to customer support to change my flight booking, but the customer support agent was not clear with his language and he was struggling to explain me saying "" he cant do the change on my booking"". I asked him to transfer the call to his supervisor or any other person, as I cant understand what he speaks, he ignored to transfer, but still I specifically said "" I want to talk"" he kept me on hold for 1:30 mins and he dint come back on line. I WAS ON HOLD FOR 1:30 MINS LISTENING TO AUTOMATED WELCOME MESSAGE AND HE NEVER REVERTED. Finally I dropped my call.

Recently I booked a return flight from Bangalore to Lucknow and finally ended up paying Rs. 600 more than what I would have paid with the airlines directly. My personal advice is to never go with such stupid websites that know very well to make a big fool of you. Stay away from such bogus offers.",1

Every time, i've been only given a new time-line for refund date. I tried their customer complaint section in their website. Since Sept-28, 2015 every two days I just get an automated response from so called ""We care"" team member ""Priyanka Dhasmana"" that I should wait till so and so date(which is usually 3 days from that date). Again after two days, the same template response will be posted automatically with just a change in the date. This is the heights of irresponsibility that a company can show to a customer. All this can happen ONLY in this COMPANY and in this COUNTRY. Despite so many calls, I was not given proper explanation regd why the refund is getting delayed.  In between they said amount was credited to bank account, but that is not true. I even sent them my bank statement proving that. As per bank's advise, I asked makemytrip ARN 23-digit transaction reference number for the refund. I didn't get that either. I am really concerned whether this company will refund my money or not. Worst thing is, without even resolving my service request, they just change the status of my SR to ""your action pending"" and now I can't even escalate the issue as the status reflects that ""my action is pending"". I'm really surprised how come there are so many positive reviews onmouthshut.comabout Makemytrip. Its just a myth to claim they have a ""We care"" team. where-as their actions clearly state they don't care about customers. Bcoz of this incident, I do not book with makemytrip anymore. Best Disgusting service award should be given to Makemytrip Forget your money if you had to cancel the bookings. I strongly feel their website name should be ""forgetyourmoney"" instead of ""makemytrip"" Frustrated after so many follow up calls and emails, Sangeetha",1
2147,"I had booked a package tour Delhi-Agra-Jaipur-Delhi. Makemytrip was requested for a cab and hotel bookings in Agra and Jaipur. My trip was scheduled to start on Saturday morning(6am). To my surprise Makemytrip did not give me the cab details by 6pm Friday. After calling them they keep assuring me that they'll send the details by 7pm. At 7pm again the same story - now it will come by 8pm. Thankfully, just after 8pm we got a call from a Cab driver. The cab driver was amazing. He was the best part of the entire trip - an all-in-one package. At Agra, we were at the hotel to be told that there is no booking from Makemytrip. It was around 1pm, with two kids, we were at a shock(a NEGATIVE experience). After almost 1 hour angry discussion(wasted time and several threats of law suits), we were promised accommodation details in 1 hour time. Instead of wasting time, we started our sightseeing. Within 1 hour we got an alternate accommodation, which was a good hotel. The first thing we did after this was to check the booking at Jaipur(just to avoid surprises). At jaipur there were no surprises - probably because I did check early. However, the hotel I checked into(Hotel Royal Orchid), a supposed to be a good star hotel, did not live up to its reputation and class. The hotel shower areas do not have lockable doors, the door handles were coming off. The first room allocated to us had abundant of cigarette smoke. We could smell cigarette smoke in the corridors. The cigarette smoke could be smelled in the alternate room provided to us. For non-smokers and specially, for people who are allergic to cigarette smoke, Royal Orchid, is a big NO. This might not be a fault of Makemytrip but, I would expect them to know and be sensitive to user feedback while booking hotels of this kind. The bad taste with Makemytrip is about surprises in reservation status. Thus, if you go with Makemytrip, call the hotel to confirm reservation, and also expect last minute arrangements w.r.t. cab bookings. BTW, this booking was done through their off-line, telephone booking agents.",3

Warm regards, Team MakeMyTrip.com Customer By(Rajnikant Gandhi)(30/10/2015 03.24 PM) We booked our trip against above bookin ID. Problems are as below 1) on 22nd Oct. when driver comes to pick up, he has no any tour plan. He asked to go directly OOty instead of our plan of via visit of Shri Rang patna and Maysore. After our argument he was agree to go Shri Rang patna. Informed to Manishben of Make my trip immediately. 2) On 22nd Maysore Palace was closed due to Dashera Function but Make my trip had not checked for the same and arrange the visit, which is floped. 3) As per driver we have to passed from forest, he insist to leave the Maysore early and not seen the Vrundavan Garden also. 4) After reaching OOty, there was no any way to reach at Hotel - Berry Hills. Only small kachchi kedi was there. Indica is not able to drive on that road. So we are unable to go at City. Than hotel has arranged to and from hotel to main road transportation on morning for sight seen. 5) When reached to Hotel in OOty, we asked for the coffee due to cold but they regret the same as it was not available at evening. They have not provided the coffee maker in the room even though we requested for the same.(If required Make my trip can visit the hotel and conform) We dont know how make my trip is arranging the trip but it was a worst trip and make my trip has to refund my money due to waste of time and money.

2151,"I have booked an International Family Holiday Package with MMT vide Booking ID NL2081492579 for Hong Kong & scheduled to fly on the night of 6th-7th November, 2015. I shall be leaving my house at 10pm. I am left with 25 hrs to leave the house. I have made innumerable emails & Telephone Calls to MMT  to send me the tickets so that I can purchase Forex but they have not responded to emails. I made a call to their Helpline number who didn't give a satisfactory reply. in-fact disconnected the call abruptly. It is my humble request to the readers to shun MMT if you want to keep your BP normal. Holiday trips are planned with family to relax & not to bite nails till the very end. I had a similar poor experience with MMT last year & had vowed not to opt for MMT but other Travel companies didn't have a Group Package on the dates that I wanted, hence I opted for MMT as a last resort & I am repenting the decision. They have a very poor Customer Care Support & Grievance Redressal Mechanism. On Mouth shut.com only 5% people have given them 5 stars as compared to their rival company to whom 50% people have give 5 stars. They are taking advantage of inefficient legal system of India since they know that going to the court is expensive & time consuming for customers. Only option left with the harassed customers is to spread the message across by word of the mouth publicity about shabby treatment of MMT",1
2152,"I wrote a review about make my trip of my real experience with make my trip after long time today 3/11/2015. I saw my review on the top of my review make my trip claimed that they resolve my issue, they simply misguide other people they never call or mail me.and I never get my refund(advance). so according to me: ""MAKE MY TRIP""= ""MAKE FOOL UR SELF"" so don't be fool now a days every service is on our mobile in form of apps like red bus for booking of bus tickets, oyo rooms and many more apps for budget hotel or 4 to7 star hotels if we use these apps for holiday surely we save more money and time.

2153,Using this for a long time I observed one thing application and website features are almost the same which cannot be find other sites. The discounts and schemes provided by them are good to go through them.We can book train and flight tickets without any effort with possible discounts. Hotel bookins also very less compared to others. The option of choosing the prices of hotels is very nice hardly you will find this type of options choosing according to our budget. International packages are good and the customer service is also good they will call you and confirm once if you book the tickets. Cab services are also there in it for all the travelling services we can choose this without any issues.,3
2154,"MakeMyTrip is a complete package of travelling & it is best when it comes to plan your travel or any vacation plans. You can book all kind of bookings such as Bus, train, flight, cabs, hotels(3, 4, 5 star, AC or non Ac), restaurants etc all over India. They also provide you offers and discounts on all types of booking. On the site they give all the fare estimations and the number of seats available. This site is very easy to use. This site completely show hotels based on food. The International travelling packages are good. The customer care is good. After booking they will call you and confirm your booking and ask any problem or issue facing.",4
2155,"MakeMyTrip will book a ticket for you on a price and if the flight is full and if anyone pay higher price for that ticket they will cancel your's automatically at the last moment. If your luck/fate is good you will have your ticket. Don't believe MakeMyTrip website confirmations and plan anything. They will ruin your good time and simply refund your money after you suffered everything. MakeMyTrip persons itself not sure about the information in their system, then how come we can make sure their ticket confirmation is genuine or not. This is what happened to me, I booked a ticket on 10/22 for my family of 4 from Bangalore to Chennai in Jet Airways for travelling on 10/25 through MakeMyTrip.com . I got all the confirmation through SMS and email. When we presented the e-Ticket at the Jet Airways Boarding counter before 2 hours of flight, they are not able to pull any information of our ticket in their system and they said they didn't received any payment for the e-ticket which we given from MakeMyTrip. From the Airport I tried calling the MakeMyTrip customer service multiple times and finally after one and half hours of hardness I got hold of a person. I simply given my confirmation number and asked the status and he said everything looks good on our ticket and we can travel. Then I informed him about the problem that nice representative put my call on hold and the line got disconnected after few minutes. Again after a hour of try I got connected to customer service and this time I directly said the problem and they coolly said your ticket got cancelled. MakeMyTrip persons itself not sure about the information then how come I can make sure their confirmation is genuine or not. When I asked about the cancellation information, they said they will raise a ticket and will get back to me in 3 days where my flight is in next 30 mins. When I asked about whether the refund has been initiated, they said its not and they will raise a ticket and will get it done by 7 -10 working days.",1
2156,"Hello friends, I would like to bring your attention to the policies of MMT how they are cheating us.I used to book all my flights through MMT mobile app.This time when I was planning to book my tickets I came to know that if you book tickets on Tuesday between 4 to 10 pm you will get 1200 cashback, I was excited.I checked prices on other websites and found out that on other websites actual price are at-least 500 rs. cheaper than MMT but I thought ok I will get 1200 cashback in MMT, so I booked to save my 600-700 rs. in hope that I will get cashback.I wrote them but they are denying by saying that you have not entered proper code.Actually these peoples are cheaters.Hope this post will help my fellow readers not to get entangled in MMT bogus offers.Its better to book your tickets from any other service provider or from airlines website only.To MMT I like to say thanks for all the services you provided to me and please DONT MAKE MY TRIP, I WILL DO IT BY MYSELF  .",1
2157,Make my trip just make your trip awesome through their awesome discounts and packs. If you want to go on vaccationa they offer a lot of discount and day and night packs with awesome hotels.

2158,"My family members and myself made three flight bookings through Makemytrip APP. As per the terms and conditions, the first time user of APP was to get back a Cashback of Rs500 per ticket withing 15 days of booking and cashback is to Cred824ited to the account/card through which aishwaryasingh23ment is made. I made the mistake and now after constant follow up of over two months, the reply which is given by the company is that consider Rs500 signin bonus given in the Makemytrip wallet as the cashback. If that was the case, what was the need for using the coupon code MMTAPP500 and sending the message that ""you have successfully used the coupon code and cashback will be Cred824ited within14 days"" It seems the company has done it deliberately to cheat the customers. Even the referral bonus which they talk about on referring the app to friends is never Cred824ited. I request everyone to be careful about any schemes of Makemytrip as it seems that they are making false promises and offers through which they just want to have a one time business. As after getting cheated the customer is not going to come and do business with a fraud company The details of my transaction were: hetamasaria@hotmail.com Delhi to Bhubaneswar flight booking id NF7201358178700 hetamasaria@gmail.com Delhi to Bhubaneswar flight booking id NF7201358180548 hetamasarias@hotmail.com Delhi to Bhubaneswar flight booking id NF7202858195582",1

2160,"I have been using Makemytrip for quite a long time, I use both the website and the app both provide quite the same functionality which is quite rare as most of the apps are don't match the websites functionality, I have used Makemytrip only for ticket booking so my review is only about that and I would like to mention that I have never faced any issues with them so my review is mainly for things other than those, Makemytrip user interface is very intuitive and it has all the possible sorting features to select the flights tickets to match the requirements and the fare calendar is very useful if we have flexible travel dates, it clearly states which flights are hand baggage only or Otherwise, Its helps creating accounts with IRCTC which is very useful considering how impossible it is to recovery your lost IRCTC accounts, The only problem I have with them is the transaction fee they charge for making any flights booking payment Which is quite high at Rs.200",4
2161,I had done booking for udaipur lalit for two nights from make my trip and they had confirmed the booking but same day evening they cancelled my booking without informing me which is pathetic and I feel I am cheated by them also I had done booking for jodhpur also which they cancelled and I had confirmed with lalit hotel they told me that my booking was confirmed. So pls don't ever trust this site and don't recommend make my trip to any one as they don't have any athics of doing bisiness and after all the email conversation no one is bother to call.  Pls all be aware of this fake site.,1

2163,"Make my trip or break my trip? Exactly this is how I felt when I booked a holiday package and paid entire amount in advance to Makemytrip. The MakeMyTrip Booking ID is IN1508B4S610939 I would surely like to warn you all as Make My Trip has come up with Double Spread full page ads announcing their holiday sale “Great Indian Getaway”. Please don't fall prey to the offers as the commitment may not be fulfilled. When I was exploring to take a small vacation, I chose Goa and spoke to Neha Rana, The travel advisor who designed the package for me. All was fine till we reached Goa airport on Spicejet flight which was ahead of schedule and reached us 30 mins prior to scheduled time. Thumbs Up spicejet. Now I realise that I should have negotiated with travel advison for meal inclusion before making the payment as there was no meal included except breakfast. I thought its fine, lets have fun and enjoy a hassle free holiday. The Horror story and suffering begins - After arrival at Goa airport I had to make hundreds of calls to various people to track my airport pick up but none could help. Each one asked me to talk to another person and I kept calling everyone when my wife and small daughter had to wait for at least two hours. Ultimately I had to book my own taxi walking out of airport around a kilometer in the sun along with my wife and daughter with luggage as there was no pre paid taxi available from airport to hotel for next one hour atleast. I paid rs. 1500/- for the taxi but I got a mail confirming the refund of only rs. 1300/- ispite of mailing mr. Durgesh the soft copy of receipt. After reaching hotel I got another surprise when the reception person called me asking for rs. 1000/- extra for my eight year old daughter for the stay each night. I again had to call makemytrip to sort out the issue. On the day of departure, Make my trip team dint take a lesson from this and messed up again on airport drop also. It was me who as a caution called make my trip to confirm about the pick up and to my horror, it happened again. They again apologized and gave me the number of one mr. Vikram, the guy who was supposed to pick us up and he confirmed that I dint get any confirmation from make mytrip so I cancelled it. One ms Swati spoke to me and she told that she had a discussion with hotel person and they will arrange the taxi for me provided I pay hotel taxi rs. 1200/-. Inspite of paying all the money in advance, I had to spent rs. 2700/- out of my pocket. I spoke to MMT again but till now only one refund mail of rs. 1300/- has been sent to me. My entire trip was with full of hassles and I had to call so many times talking to so many people that the there was no fun left. Besides this when I used to call MMT to resolve an issue, they used to put my call on hold for long durations that many times I had to cut the call and call back again. I would suggest everyone to think twice before taking any package from them as in India, I could manage the out of pocket expenditures in the same currency but think of a situation when you are abroad and not carrying enough currency thinking you paid in advance for everything. You may be stranded at airport of for any other service or simply a miss communication regarding hotel stay or sight seeing. I will update you all on my communication with Make My Trip as to how and when they resolved my issues and do something about the suffering and mental agony I went through.",1
2164,"I tried to book a ticket through their Android app, and I made the payment and the payment was successful but the transaction failed. I thought it must be a problem with my net connection and repeated the procedure, with the same result. It has been almost a month since that transaction, and Makemytrip hasn't refunded my money of 1 complete transaction! Every 3 days, I have to call them up and wait for more than half an hour as they keep transferring my call from 1 department to another, saying I have reached the wrong department(when in fact they keep transferring me!), and if by chance I connect to the right one(it normally takes 3 30-minute calls for me to actually reach the'correct' department), they tell me that give us 3 more days, our team is trying to solve the issue and your money will be refunded. They say we have a huge list of refunds pending(what do I do if you provide bad service. Why should I wait longer if your service is worse than anything?!)! If you can't provide service, don't make promises. And the customer has many more things to do than to keep check of 1 refund all the time. Worst experience.",1

2168,"Booked a hotel in Pondicherry for Rs.3600 from MakeMyTrip. Butfound out from the hotel reception that the tariff is only 1500 and at max 2000 during peak seasons. The room is only worth that. It is just an 80sqft cubicle with a double bed and AC plus a small 20sqft toilet. That room is totally worthless than 1500. And that is the tariff as accepted by the reception guy. He was also wondering why MakeMyTrip took 3600 from me. Now I am feeling cheated by MakeMyTrip. If the hotel is charging only 1500, why isMakeMyTrip charging 3600. They are taking 400 as MakeMyTrip service fee. Still they took twice the tariff and totally cheated us.This kind of worst behavior was not expected from MakeMyTrip.On the top of that I had to pay another 200 directly to the hotel as taxes. For a night's stay in a dungeon worth 1500, I end up paying 4000. Now I am totally depressed when I think of how MakeMyTrip cheated me. Please beware of the rates whenever you book rooms through MakeMyTrip. It is not cheap as they claim. They cheat you. THESE GUYS ARE CHEAP.",3

2173,"MakeMyTrip is good for booking flights since i've been using it for years had no issues with but I made the saddest mistake of booking a Holiday package with them where I had to interact with their reps. Chat service as well as phone customer care are both hopeless. Had to wait on queue for eternity - they booked the wrong room for us and despite 5 calls nobody could help us, then quite unlike other times, we did not receive our flight tickets for the next morning's flight. The worst was there was no one waiting to pick us at the airport despite having paid for the service and what's even frustrating was that our call went to their amazing long queue where nobody responded and finally when it got through, he hung up! wow! Thanks to the Aiport Security man who knew the local taxi agency who had a tie-up with Makemytrip and called the guy for us. After this we decided it was best we find our own taxi despite having paid Makemytrip for tours, sightseeing and airport transfer transport. why spoil our holiday for their poorly managed customer care? Best just book only flights or hotels separately from this site and NOT a package - where the need may arise to speak to a human, who most probably might be frustrated with his job and does not care to assist you even if you had paid a hefty sum for the package. I will now look for local, small-scale travel agents preferably operating in the destination where I am headed - better local knowledge, personalised planning, on-time airport pickup and they will not make you wait in the queue for hours before slamming the phone on your face with ""we are big, so you oughta wait in the hot sun for the taxi that will never come"" attitude.",1

2175,"Booked a hotel in Pondicherry for Rs.3600 from makemytrip. But found out from the hotel reception that the tariff is only 1500 and at max 2000 during peak seasons. The room is only worth that. It is just an 80sqft cubicle with a double bed and AC plus a small 20sqft toilet. That room is totally worth less than 1500. And that is the tariff as accepted by the reception guy. He was also wondering why makemytrip took 3600 from me. Now iam feeling cheated by makemytrip. If the hotel is charging only 1500, why is makemytrip charging 3600. They are taking 400 as makemytrip service fee. Still they took twice the tariff and totally cheated us. This kind of worst behavior was not expected from makemytrip. On the top of that I had to pay another 200 directly to the hotel as taxes. For a night's stay in a dungeon worth 1500, I end up paying 4000. Now iam totally depressed when I think of how makemytrip cheated me. Please beware of the rates whenever u book rooms through makemytrip. It is not cheap as they claim. They cheat you. THESE GUYS ARE CHEAP.",1
2176,I heard a lot about this website then I decided to take a chance with this for my trip. I booked 3 tickets from Delhi to manali via makemytrip website.

I called them twice and I had a good conversation with their agents and their solved my query(which was regarding my booking) very fast.

I used this time make my trip to book ticket now I paid just four thousand for the trip Mumbai to Varanasi which is affordable .so use it .,4
2181,"Hi, I have been a customer of makemytrip from many years but lately, I see a very very scary trend. They are cheating customers during cancellation of trips by inflating the penalties, hiding details, giving wrong information. I am summarizing few instances I booked a ticket for Diwali 2015 time which was around 17 thousand plus and later modified booking to another date. On website, it showed that even after paying the modification penalty of approx Rs 3700, the new ticket price is so less that I should not get a refund of Rs 5100+. At that instant, website gave me a message that a person will call back in 24 hours. Then, a person called after 24 hours and said that they will just adjust the money and make the modification. They never gave the refund of Rs 5100+. This was VERY ANNOYING. Directly booking with the airline would have been much better instead of booking through makemytrip in this case. I booked air tickets for my family and had to cancel them, I checked with airline on exact amount that they credited to makemytrip, but makemytrip here played smart. They charged Rs 300 per passenger as penalty(which is fine as they inform this in advance also) but they also charged a convenience fee of Rs 200 per passenger for cancellation as well. This is something that just pissed me off as they didn't inform about this even after I asked about any other cancellation fee in 2 customer care calls. In essence, they charged me convenience fee at the time of booking and penalty+convenience fee at the time of cancellation. They are making wrong calculations in invoices. If there is a way to upload screenshots/pdfs, I would have shown it to you. I want to rate them ZERO or NEGATIVE, if there is an option.",1

2184,"This is regarding my unpleasant and terrible experience with the travel agents and bus companies linked with your Company Make my Trip. This is not just a complain, its an eye opener too for other travellers that rely on you and your brand name and incidents like this ruin your name. I and my friend had booked an AC VOLVO SLEEPER BUS(please note-semi-sleeper bus) for to and fro journey from Delhi to Kangra(Himachal) dated 1st oct'15, 7:00 PM bus to be boarded from Majnu ka Tila. But instead of the semi sleeper bus the concerned travel company Himachal Tourist Volvo bus(pvt.bus), provided us the ordinary AC seater bus whose fare was also far less than what we paid online. its not about the fare, for our comfort we had booked a semi sleeper bus for a journey of 11 hrs but the concerned company operator misbehaved with us and told that he would not arrange for the other bus and asked us to get down of the bus if we dnt want to go in that. And mind you, this happened not once but again on our return journey. same atory, we were again denied a semisleeper bus and given a seater bus instead, this time the operator was Laxmi holidays and above this how did Laxmi travels come into picture when I had booked Kanak holidays, so we talked to the make my trip customer care and lodged a complain against them. you ppl assured us that our money would be refunded, but please tell us who would pay for the inconvinience and mental harrasment we went through, u did arrange the semi sleeper bus but our journey and holiday mood turned bitter because of the fraus that these company men do, they do this to all tourists. I was not a tourist, I am a native of the place Kangra and had always travelled in the HRTC Govt volvo, which has always been reliable and comfortable, so I found out how these people are minting money, they make other tourists who book seats from the bus counter get into the semisleeper bus and put the money in their pockets and the online customers are made to travel in the ordinary seater buses as they know that the tourists will not have any other option but to travel in whatever you give them. Its a big shame how they loot tourists and other travellers, and this is all happening under your nose, you are aware or not, we dnt know, but fault is at your end too, you should provide the bus number when u send the ticket and PNR in the messages, coz the buses are never on time, they purposely swap the bus timings to mislead the travelers, and did u ever bother to check what facilities they provide in the bus. torn blankets, damaged seats. and the place where they stop for eating. its heights, such bad food in some unhygeinic dhaba who charge 400Rs just for daal roti, and not a decent place for ladies atleast, the washrooms so unhyegenic.its the tie up between these travel companies and the food joints who grab money and loot people to make their trip unpleasant, You should take action against these miscreants who have brought a bad name to your company and we would refrain from booking our travel from you people from now on, Sad. very sad, I am enclosing some pictures which would reflect what I had to face on this horrible journey.",1
2185,"Tripti the host, is the worst host I have ever seen. Esp if u go with a kid, don't expect any support from her. It was like as if we stayed in a hostel with a school teacher/warden telling us do this, don't do this. She is extremely snobbish. When we left some beetroot, next day she will nag that she will not serve vegetables because it was wasted. She will ask us what we would like to eat n she herself will say mutton is not served because it's very expensive. She said we gave to be for breakfast before 10, else they will close the kitchen. She was the one who said coorgis hike up the price if they see tourist. When we asked her if we need to bargain while buying spices, she bluntly n rudely said "" we do not believe in bargaining. Do not bargain anywhere in coorg"". This lady is the worst host I ever saw. In fact I wanted to shift to soneother place immediately but couldn't find one. Everytime she nagged n insulted, it hurt me so badly that it spoilt my vacation. It was as if she was a nagging mother in law. When I requested something for my baby again bluntly she said "" u will only get bread n jam and that's it"". They don't serve lunch n In case if u even ask for bread in between, she will say"" we women in coorg don't get a break from kitchen. So we don't get inside the kitchen after breakfast"". How worst can it become! My sincere request is pls of not ever go to this place. There are snakes, spiders. No mesh in the windows. When asked, she will say this is how plantation stay will be. Horrible lady. She is a bad example for a homestay concept in coorg. I came with great expectation n it was a disastrous. We had earlier been to a homestay where the host made it memorable. But not all homestays r like that is what I understood in the end. Everyday she had something or the other to spoil my mood. Last thing, when we were eating our breakfast, lizard fell on the table from top.",1
2186,"Booking a tour through Makemytrip isnt all that easy as one would expect it to be. After confirming our dates and making part payment, we had to make 100s of calls and send emails for the smallest of the things while booking our 7 day trip to Turkey. They insist on full payment even without releasing the flight tickets or hotel booking details, vouchers etc. More over the tour guide- Mr Ibrahim was the worst of all. Makemytrip has a tie-up with a local turkish tour company called Dorak tour. And this Mr.Ibrahim was the biggest disappointment that we had on our turkey tour Rude is an understatement for him! He would be ready to pick a fight over any small question that we would ask him! For instance, at the Antalya museum, he told us guides are not allowed inside and hence he would wait outside for us whereas there were many groups with their tour guides beautifully explaining the ancient history of a lot of things in there. Upon return, I just told him that there were many tour guides inside, why didnt u join us? he got so aggravated by this simple question and blasted at us saying ""check ur itenary.check your bookings first! Is it mentioned on your booking that I should come inside? My company hasnt asked me to do a guided tour.!"" We were very shocked at his response but still we just said ""ok.we need to check.""just to pacify the situation! he has no signs of a gentleman or a fun tour guide at all! The other time, We flew from cappadocia to Istanbul and then a bus journey of 2.5hrs to reach our hotels. He said that our linch buffet has been arranged at a nearbyindian hotel . It was 3pm then. So we, a group of 33people including a few infants and children started following him in the narrow bylanes of turkey as the bus couldnt go any further. Suddenly Mr Ibrahim chose to run so fast that most of us lost track of him mid way and didnt know where to go! Just imagine being stranded in the middle of a non- english speaking country at 3pm(summers) with kids along! After enquiring a little bit with the locals who barely understand english we found the way to the hotel and guess who is standing at the entrance?  Mr Ibrahim was standing  right there. One of us lost our cool and yelled at him saying this is not the way to abandon half the group in a totally new city to which he bluntly responded "" the others were running!""  I mean all of us were new to the place, how can anyone run ahead of him towards the restaurant?isnt it the guides reaponsibilty to keep everyone at the same pace or atleast make sure everyone is following him? He didnt even have the courtesy to say sorry after all this drama! After lunch we got onto the bus again and headed  towards our respective hotels. I, along with 12 others was supposed to be dropped to Grand Yavuz hotel, which is about 5-7mins walk from the bus drop off point. This fellow lost his way and made us walk with all our hand luggage and kids in strollers for about 20minutes again and then simple shrug his shoulders saying ""Ohh this is the long way huh! Next time we take the shortcut!"" He would have definitely been punched by now, had this been my homeland. And guess what, again no signs of being sorry! And to top it all he collected his tip money 25$ per person 3 days before our tour got over may be because he could sense our dissatisfaction towards his services. He hardly gave us any information except for a little history of turkey and about terrorism in Turkey. We chose to roam around without a guide for the last 3 days in Istanbul as it was simply annoying to have an irritated tour guide by our side who just wouldnt divulge any information!",3

2188,"Holiday Trip to Mauritius” - I had taken a Holiday Trip for myself and Family ( Four of us) to Mauritius. Overall the visit and the way MMT arranged were good, but there was a problem with the HOTEL BOOKING. I had booked for TWO rooms since we were all adults. At the time of booking, MMt also confirmed as TWO rooms. However, on landing at the hotel, the hotel authorities booked us all four in one 'FAMILY' room. The room did have two Bed rooms, but the problem was ti had only one Bathroom. Hence it became very difficult to get ready in the mornings. The local service provided did try to get a change from MMT India, but there was no help coming. Finally we ended up spending all Seven days in ONE room and this made our holiday experience quite BAD.",1

It was damn simple for me to utilize the site, withing 3-4 seconds each page of the site got stacked and made me utilize the administrations, effortlessly. Indeed, even the client consideration group of the organization is great. When the booking was finished by me they called and get some information about the affirmation or any assistance which I require from them.

The site is OK, but don't fall for the freebies thinking them to be ticket discount. You will most certainly not get it. I had even written a mail, but got only one automated response that they are looking into the issue. Consider the cashback as just a way to entice you to book from makemytrip rather than other site. Next time I wont even bother with cash back and just go for whichever site is giving a better rate or deal. One start for making a fool out of people.",1
2192,"I had booked my tickets from Jaipur to Kochi and back on 13th Sept'15 with booking ID NF2203050130473. Before booking the ticket, for many days I had been checking the schedule of flights so as to fit my schedule as I was going for a wedding in the family. I had finalized the return flight from Kochi at 2200 hrs on 24th October'15, since that was the time most suitable to me. Now, after doing research for more than 15 days, when I finally chose Make my trip to book my flight and went ahead to book the same, what details I got in my PNR was of the flight that will take off at 1620 hrs instead of 2200 hrs. I was shocked to see the time in my PNR changed and immediately called customer care at Make my trip. There I was informed that I will have to wait for 48 hrs for my booking to be registered and reflect in their system. Hence I waited and called after 2 days. I repeated my issue to the executive at customer care at least thrice before he could log my problem in the system(Continuously denying that there could be any mistake from their side). Post logging my complaint I was told that it would be reverted within 2 days time. That did not happen and after waiting for 3 days thinking I might get a revert soon, I called back, repeated the process as mentioned above and was told that yes there Might have been a complaint in the system about the matter""and would be sent to a senior since it was not getting resolved on the basic level. I was told that it would take the senior person 5 working days to understand, research and study my problem and then take any action upon it. I was offered to meanwhile cancel and re-book my ticket at an additional cost for the new ticket and IF there was any fault from trier side I MIGHT get the refund back. Just my luck that I did not take that step. Again I waited for one full week, waiting and anticipating a better response from Make my trip's team, but in vain. When after 1 week I called back I was connected to a man who said that they had done their research and their IT people are saying that the fault is from my side and instantly mailed me a strange looking log and telling me that the log proved that the ticket was booked from my end for 1620 hrs on 24th October'15(Honestly, it could have been a formula to make a nuclear bomb and I would not know!). I was asked if I have any PROOF that it was Make my trip's fault, Did I take a screen shot while booking the tickets. I AM SORRY I DID NOT KNOW I WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO TRUST MAKE MY TRIP AND TAKE SNAPSHOTS OF EVERYTHING I DID ON IT RELATED TO BOOKING A TICKET. I was exhausted, let down, shocked and amazed at the way I had been treated for 2 long weeks from Make my trip people and at the end it was MY fault!? I still wanted to try one last time and asked the guy to transfer my call to any senior person in the team to which I was told it is the final reply and no one can do anything about it. I still insisted on talking to the senior so he told me a call back would be arranged shortly, I hung up. No response for 2 more days. I called back. Now a lady picked my call and I repeated my story to her, she checked my history and said I was given the final answer and there was nothing more she could do about it. I was furious and frustrated and said I want to talk to a senior in their team to which she mockingly laughs and says in a singing tone that there is nothing any senior can even do about my case. I still press on talking to some senior person to which I am dismissed by saying that someone will call me in 2 hours time. Three days have passed since then and no response. Yesterday I got a message saying someone tried reaching me on my phone but could not connect and will call back soon. Now, I have been getting calls from everywhere in the country APART from Make my trip?! How is that even possible. In my defense I always said that why would I book a ticket for 1620 Hrs when I know that I will be in the middle of a wedding at that point of time and the airport from the wedding venue is at least 2 hours away, if not more. WHY?! Why would in waste 20000/- rupees on a wrong ticket?! Am I that stupid?! Was I born yesterday?! Do I not know how to check time or how to book a ticket?! NO. My only mistake was to book the tickets with Make my trip and ruin my experience of going to a destination wedding. The people at Make my trip have got an air of dictatorship in their heads and have forgotten that they are also only humans like the rest of us. I have been robbed off my money, mental peace and excitement of a wedding in my family. Instead, every time now when I think of the wedding I get depressed thinking about the way Make my trip team has treated me for trusting it and my wrongly booked tickets. Can anyone do anything about it or is this mail also a waste of time and energy?!",1

2195,"So I have used MMT.com earlier also but it was mainly for Air tickets and hotel bookings. So in a nutshell I was aware of what I was paying for as I could easily see on the direct airline website or the with the hotel directly how much they are charging me for a direct booking, make a comparison and choose and settle for the best option. But this time I was exploring a new thing, ""The Holiday Package"", as convinient it may sound, it is where these travel companies actually make there REAL money. Yes, it didn't take me long to understand their entire game here. As my habit is always to do a lot of research, do comparisons and then settle for the best choice. So here's what is happening, unlike travel tickets or hotel bookings only, holiday packages allow companies like MMT to overcharge customers by sneaking costs in an overall amount which may look attractive to a customer initially, although at anytime if a customer would try and do all the involved items booking separately, would save ATLEAST upto 30% of the overall cost. The travel companies earn maximum of their profits by selling travel packages, these are high margin products, where the travel companies like MMT using bundeled booking option with airlines and direct hotels manage to save a lot of cost and sell these to their customers at WAY higher prices. They would spend a large amount of some on marketing, placing AD's in newspapers, paying HIGH COMMISSIONS to their sales staff on every package they sell. Ultimately a customer ends up buying a product at 1.5 times its actual cost. Since maximum number of such buyers are Honeymoon couples, who normally do not have time to spend on exploring and understanding the actual math behind this, ultimately companies like MMT are benefiting. So next time you book a travel package with MMT or any other travel company, ask them to provide you with the cost breakdown of what you are actually paying for and listen for yourself their response on such a request. I want to spread this to all, so that we all understand this big scam that is going on and waiting for a day when these inflated prices become more realistic instead. I am taking more steps, which i'll share soon to discourage such kind of practice currently being used by travel companies. Thanks Rahul",1
2196,"I booked this package as a part of my honey moon plan and I am very sorry to say that the trip was disappointing. The main reason for this is the tight schedule. I reside at trivandrum and flights to any gulf country is widely available from all the three airports in kerala and I have Trivandrum International Airport as my nearby airport, but still they provided me a flight only from Bangalore, Bangalore-Doha-Paris. I had to go all the way to bangalore and again from bangalore had to travel for at least 10 hours. After such a long tiring flight, they straight away took us for the city tour and we were left at hotel after that only. Maximum of us couldnt enjoy it due to tiredness. They had an optional trip to disney land next day and again after a superb but heavy day on disneyland they conducted an optional tour'night in paris"". Night in Paris was nothing but the same city tour. They could have very well taken us for the night in paris the same day we arrived after giving a couple of hours rest in some hotel and could have avoided it on the next day. And I dont understand why city tour is repeated in another name and the only difference is that u can get down and click photographs. After such long and tiring tours we reach hotel and will sleep madly. The indian Dinner provided at Paris was just average. The third day you does nothing but travelling. All the way from paris to engelberg. it takes around 10 hours in bus. Again another tiring day. The dinner provided on that day was superb. Next day morning to noon at mount Titlis and then city tour to Luzen and then from there to Zurich and then all the way back to Hotel at Engelberg, It will be a repetation if I say the word tiring again, next day to Jungfraujoch and then city tour to interlaken, finally we leave for Zurich again to stay overnight. And then next day morning we flew back.And all together I would say they made us do some hardwork when we came to relax a littlebit. PS: The hotels provided were not the ones which was mentioned in the website. The offered one lunch was not fullfilled. The restaurents the took us to were just average.",2
2197,Make my trip.com A website that provides booking of air tickets and some really amazing trips Nationally as well as internationally.

They had a grand welcome in the state and still cherish it. All the promises that were made were very well delivered with efficiency. They consider this trip to be the best trip of so far as they were tension free from everything.

2198,This  review about  the rewards program and  the sloppy   back office  operations .  Alike all programs it encourages you maximize bookings and earn free vouchers and room nights . However my experience with  using  the free room  night was nightmarish  . I booked a  premium resort  in Nasik in middle of august  2015 using my points . Obviously a pricy resort  came cheap to me as there was a discount of Rs 3500  on the  price . On 12th September  a MMT executive  called up informing  they are very much ashamed of the resort who is now  cancelling the booking due to over booking  and it was  not  MMT  fault at all! They  assured prompt reversal  of the monies paid an the points redeemed so that I can reuse them  . While the money got reversed  the  free room night  promo code did not This is when I realised  that  the whole  rewards program is a fraud  and prank on  unsuspecting customers .!Make them  maximise bookings . find and excuse to cancel  the booking so that  MMT does not bear the tab of a high discount . and laugh away to the bank . Sirji  hamara dil to roaming hai ji but aaap ka to  sleeping hai  ji?,1
2199,"2 tickets for Bangalore to Chandigarh was not processed by MakeMyTrip, however a PNR number was generated causing me to believe that the tickets were confirmed. However, on the day of the trip, IndiGo declined our check in with a simple statement that the “payment was not processed” by Makemytrip. When I connected with customer care 10 mins before the boarding gate closes, I was told that I had to pay for my tickets again and that MakeMyTrip will refund the same within 7 working days. When asked to send a mail accepting the mistake Makemytrip has done, I was sent an instructional mail for my claim, In spite of asking twice in my telephonic conversation with customer care. We were 2 travelling women with limited funds and we were forced to compromise on our safety and comfort during our travel thanks to the last minute tickets we had to buy. Makemytrip had 22 days to process my payment, which they did not. Note that I am not the only one who has faced such an experience from MakeMyTrip. I did make it a point to inform one and all about my misfortune with MakeMyTrip and realised that there were few within my own circles who faced similar problems. I would suggest that for future ticket bookings, We'd rather book and pay the airlines directly rather going through Makemytrip, we can save cancellation prices as well such incidents don't happen.",1
2200,"I had booked an international ticket for two passengers journey commencing on 01 Sep 15 vide Booking ID IN1506B2S229482. On 26 Aug 15 at 1843 hrs I cancelled this ticket and was told that a refund would be given to me in 5 working days. Today is 15th Sep and my refund has not been credited as yet. I have contacted them several times but the response is the same, ""they are looking into the matter"". I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that supervisors are busy and they would call me back in 4 hours. Not having received a call for 24 hours, I again called them and this time was told that a supervisor will call me in 24 hours. Makemytrip.com is perhaps the biggest online travel agency in India, but the rot has set in and it is only a matter of time when they will eventually crumble. Most probably the top management does not even know how inefficient the customer support staff is, and the success or failure of any online company depends solely on the Customer Support. I would ask readers to try out yatra.com, giibibo.com or many others that have come up. I for one will never step near makemytrip.com again.",1

They deliberately put you on hold for more than 20 minutes, if we talk or correspond to our emails very rarely or sending the same email saying that ""we request you to kindly wait for more 24 working hours as we will get back to you"". What a sarcastic way to handle a customer by a leading travel agent in India. I don't understand on thing, does MMT don't have any owner or top most managers to check these kind of complaints and rectify it? So please be more careful to all of you while dealing with this fraud company in the future.",2
2202,"There were lots of travel players in travel industry but I would say no one is near to comepete with makemytrip.com I've booked my honeymoon trip hotel in Udaipur from makemytrip & experience was really cool. They gave me good offer & discount. I tried the same hotel in different website but makemytrip was the cheapest & giving more features. So, I booked from makemytrip without second thought. In future, I will keep booking & will keep sharing my experience. I hope experience would be same as before.",4
2203,"Booked a package with a booking id IN1507B3S285476 for Andaman and promised cashback was not provided. I had a detailed conversation with one of the executive(name intentionally not mentioned) who informed that if I book the complete package and use hdfc credit card for booking then I will be elligible for Rs.10000 of cash back or 20% cash back whichever is less. I forwarded him my first six digits and it was intimated that my card is elligible for this offer. My total trip amounted to 65000 and after the cash back it would have amounted to 55000.after the cash back. I was in personal touch with their executive who guided me to an executive who helped me out in the payment. He also informed me about the code which needed to be entered for availing the discount. He asked me to once enter the code HDFCHOLIDAY and proceed with the payment which I sincerely did. He told that the payment of Rs.10000 will be recredited to my account after 60 days. I still had few doubts and hence I had a detailed long conversation with one of their lady executive for two times First on August 5 at 7:14 PM for 9 minutes 44 seconds Second on August 6 at 3:02 PM for 2 minutes and 46 seconds She herself confirmed confidently that the cashback will reflect after 60 days. It is surprising that after such assurances and commitments from them I am made to undergo this torture. Is It for this headache someone would outsource his travel plans to travel agency. After having few issues against the committed things in the trip I again forwarded the mail for reconfirmation and suddenly I am made to hear this story of cashback not being entered which is very surprising from makemytrip. Their has been repeated emails but makemytrip has refrained to respond to our querries. ""NEVER EVER FALL IN SWEET WORDS` TRAP OF MAKEMYTRIP""",1

Hotel Owner told me that makemytrip messed this and they didn't inform the hotel. I called makemytrip and after like 1 hr on the phone with them they gave me the alternate hotel. They negotiated with me for extra 1 hr about how much they will compensate in the fare difference. Finally around 3 am they decided that they will compensate the extra charges upto Rs 450 - 500 per night. Now I am chasing them for last 1.5 months, called 4 times but they have not Cred824ited the amount. @MMT - Incase you want to hear the recording, please check for 23rd July between 1 am - 4 am.

2208,I booked international flight from Hongkong to bangkok and bangkok to delhi. via MakeMyTrip. Com over the phone.We were 2 passengers. Over the phone I was booking the ticket and I was talking to Mr. Ravi. From Make my Trip. First he told me to pay 30956 Rs. For the tickets. . He send me a link and I paid the amount at the same time by using my credit card. After the payment done he said sir your flight Hongkong to Bangkok is done but bangkok to delhi not confirmed because spice jet increase the price now you need to pay more. that time he ask me to pay 9776 more. That I paid. After rreturning back to India I ask invoice from the MakeMyTrip and breakup amount but every time they said our system is updating please call later. I feel they have cheated me. Then I directly call to airlines office and ask for bill invoice. and I got success to get from the both. I was surprised to see that it was 30956 total and They have cheat me 9776. After mail so many times to MakeMyTrip but these people not shown their interest and ignore my mail. After that I approach consumer court. suddenly I received call from MakeMyTrip that sir we have refund your amount kindly do not approach consumer court. This MakeMyTrip is totally fraud company.

2209,Their customer service is worst. They are a fraud company. I've had very horrible experience with their customer service. They will just keep replying to your email/tweet with an apology but do not resolve the issue. Their customer service folks do not also read the customer's email properly and simply just send respond with scripted tempates. Regarding deal codes/coupons on their site & app; they advertise something to get the bookings and then make a fool of the customer by not adhering to the scheme related benefits. The customer keeps following up. My 2 cents on MMT - never use this site for your travel bookings Mouthshut.com- please also have an option of less than one star so the same can be used for make my trip.com.,1
2210,"I had read so many good reviews about make my trip but my experience is just contrary. I am presently abroad and booked a domestic wing of the journey  from New Delhi to Ranchi with booking Id NF2201449332525. My biggest mistake is that I chose Insurance and the premium was approximately Rs 700 for three persons. To my surprise, I didn't find any insurance on the tickets issued. I raised a complaint for the same to learn from the company that insurance was never chosen and the amount I paid was not for Insurance. I shockingly observed that an amount of Rs 600/- was adjusted towards the convenience fee which never appeared at the time of booking. Till I write this review, I found that if you go for a fresh booking, its not there. I even escalated my complaints twice but of no help. Disappointed by the response I decided to cancel the ticket and book it through different travel company.I did the same and again they deducted Rs 5412 instead of Rs 4650( 1550x3- persons) i.e a shortfall of Rs 762/- which is the amount of premium I paid for the insurance. The insurance which they were not ready to acknowledge, the premium was deducted at the time of cancellation. My advise to the readers is if you are opting for'add-ons' in make my trip, please preserve the screen shot of the fare shown prior to making payments otherwise you may also face the same problem as I faced. * The onus of proving the services you have paid for, lies with you other wise  make my trip has got so many heads to adjust your fare* . * I wouldnot like to recommend MMT but by default the selection is yes* . I must mention that hey are fast enough in refunding the money I shall be sharing my experience with other travel company soon.",1

2213,"Few months ago I got a call from Makemytrip saying that they are offering some travel package to customers. The cost of the package is Rs.6616. When I further inquired about the package, they said they will be giving branded wrist watch, some domestic and international travel vouchers and dining card. I was not interested on those vouchers except the dining card. When I further enquired about the dining card, they said I will be getting 25% flat off on airline booking and departmental stores like bigbazaar and reliance fresh. Today when I received the dining card, I could see in the booklet that only restaurants and hotels are there in the list and no departmental centre is there. Further, in the restaurants and hotels only 5% to 15% discount is given rather than 25%. Makemytrip cheated me very badly as my entire amount has gone for toss.",1
2214,"Hi, I just completed my travel made car rental booking with makemytrip from 7-10 August 2015 from delhi-Agra-Mussoorie-Delhi four months in advance, very well planned and did homework. I was initially contacted by dilasini an agent from makemytrip for my whole itinerary lucky I booked my own accomodation. Booking ID: IN1506B2S099235, Complaint Reference ID: 150812-049167. Makemytrip was so caring until you make your payment. They call you every one hour and urge you to make payment. Once your payment is done, you're dead forever. No one will contact you and theres no-one you can reach after that. This agent prepared an itinerary on friday to visit agra. I asked her to change itinerary as agra and most shops will be closed on friday's. Advised her to add dhaunalti to itinerary. She repeatedly told me that she's waiting for the techinical team to update her. She prolonged this until a week before our travel, then suddenly she is informing your bookings are transferred to my manager mahesh bhatt. This guy talked to us so friendly and said he'll will help us by guiding us in the trip along as we are visiting india for first time. This guy mahesh bhatt made us to book hotel, food and travel expenses for him. He said he travelled agra like 1000times and mussoorie like 3times. Thats the reason we decided to take his help as we made booking through makemytrip and he is an employee which will be of great help we thought. We finally regretted a lot for it. This guy never revealed any information related to driver or rental services, just replied always am travelling along and everything well taken care of, dont worry. I again updated this guy that itinerary must be changed as agra is closed on fridays and dhanaulti must be added. Dont worry just pay few hundreds/thousands extra driver will take you wherever you want and can inform the driver on the spot. No need to be included in the itinerary was told. Once we arrived the airport, there is noone to pickup us from the airport. Mahesh bhatt made us to wait in airport for two hours at the Airport EXIT. We are all three friends travelled together. He picked us from airport only after we made a call to him and simply said nothing for his delay. Then instead of taking us through yamuna expressway this guy took us through another way that took 6hours to reach agra and reached agra at 9pm and all shops were closed. This guy ate food like hell as though he has never seen any food before. His hotel was booked by us, his travel for car was upgraded to 3000 rupees extra as he informed us car will not be spacious so upgrade car, and all of his expenses were paid by us. It was informed by these agents that no need to pay anything for  driver, toll taxes as all are included in package. But we paid for for every meal of driver food and all toll taxes etc. When we asked him so many questions, he said you need to pay everything its not included. Then we asked him why was it then informed us package includes everything, he always replied us dont know, dont ask me, I am just travelling like a friend and nothing to do with guiding. You must ask dilasini. When we asked him to call dilasini, he said she left the job, no one can contact her. If you want go contact her. How to contact someone who left the job already from mmt? who takes the responsibility? As all our bookings are transferred to this guy mahesh bhatt before a week from our travel date and we informed him about everything of our itinerary changes, who's responsibility is that? When we asked him then for what reason you travelled with us, he just didnot reply anything, instead he said am just a friend. How the hell he could become our friends if we didnot take up this booking via makemytrip and if he didnot serve us on this booking? Finally we didnot do any sightseeing for four days except for taj mahal. We did 2hrs shopping at mall road mussoorie that's it. We registered a complaint to makemytrip, but instead of providing solution, this company just closed the case thrice without notifying or contacting us for anything. I repeatedly reopend the case and they kept closing the case after a week without contacting us for anything. This guy whatsapp us to withdraw complaint as he'll lose his job. The way he pleaded and cried, we took pity on him and wrote an another email to hellotravel(as I feedback my reviews to hellotravel about this guy and mmt about their worst service to us) that this is a misunderstanding and withdraw my review feedback provided about this guy. This was written only to hellotravel. Immediate after this email, this guy took advantage of it and again started troubling us by forcing us to take a trip along with him and pay for him again for accomodation for 10days which we were planning for coming december. when I refused to trust mmt and this guy for our next trip, he started becoming nasty immediately. I reopened the case again on him of this behaviour to mmt. And immediately sent an email to hellotravel about his attitude and I notified hellotravel about this incident. I wanted mmt to take action on this guy and the way he is misusing mmt customers and cheatinng them. when mmt asked him to reply on this complaint, this guy immediately sent an whatsapp msg and sms that says will you withdraw your complaint or you want me to lose my job?  He mentioned in all his msgs to withdraw  the complaint as he'll lose his job. I told him its your mistake and you should be punished for cheating us on our money time and everyone of  our trust. This guy immediately keep sending msgs an whatsapp msg that will you withdraw your complaint or you want me to lose my job and this guy is so stubborn to cheat people as many times as he would. Later again after a week, Makemytrip took no action and simply closed the case. I reopened the case again last saturday. But mmt closed the case yesterday saying that as I have withdraw my complaint to hellotrval they have resolved my case. When I register complaint to mmt, contact me, enquire me about information then investigate thoroughly and take action on the case. When I have not mentioned mmt about hellotravel feedback how did mmt came to know about this and resolved my case yesterday 5:03pm? I later forwarded to mmt the email review feedback I sent to hellotravel about this incident. Only after this forwarded email they should be aware of this? How did mmt come to know about it even earlier I forwaded the email? They closed it based on hellotravel review, how could that happen? I have reopened the case again and registered a complaint to consumercomplaints india online and National consumer delhi online. Never ever choose this makemytrip forever in your life viewers. They can never help people in their bookings. They just want to protect their honor and their employees who cheat their customers. Lucky the driver was so good and he helped us by saving us from this guy and his cheap tricks. Thanks to the driver. Decided never makemytrip again for anyone as they dont makeur trip, they spoilurtrip. Pls be careful before choosing your travel agents, rather choose your own car rental services and plan your itinerary to save all your money. That saves a lot of money. As everything is available online now. choose the trusting partners not someone like makemytrip who cheat on their customers and never care to provide solution too. I totally wasted lots of money on whole package and makemytrip guy mahesh bhatt for over thousand dollars.",1
2215,"I see people praising Makemytrip for all the options it provides, however I had an extremely disappointing experience. I am planning weekend getaway to Goa, so I start checking flight rates on makemytrip.com. It has few good flight options such as 2.8k one way flight, but when I try to book it, it says your flight fare have been updated to 3.5k. I felt betrayed, but at the same time, I get this notification from Makemytrip app on my phone of a holiday package for 3 nights and 4 days. Very excitingly I open the app to check the deal. When I see the holiday package price, what an amazing coincidence, I just got the deal tht perfectly fits my budget. So, I try to book the same and the message I get, ""We are still working on this feature, please provide your details below and our executive will call you back"". Nevertheless, I leave my contact details, but to my surprise I do not get call back for 4 to 5 bours. Nevermind, I ignore that and call them myself after the long wait. Now is the shocking part, I call makemytrip customer service and this is what happens: I get connected in 5 mins and rep says, will transfer to our Goa desk. After waiting for another 5 mins, when I ask for Goa promotion deals, rep says I need all your details before I share any information. After providing all my details like email and cell no. When I ask for Goa deals, he says will transfer me to Goa team. After another few mins of wait, when I get connected rep who answers the phone knows nothing about Goa deal saying this over the phone/off line booking team and knows anothing about online deals. Now he transfers me to online deal team. When this another goa online team rep answers the phone, he says this is post booking team and knows nothing about online deals. Now he puts me on hold saying let me check and never returns. After waiting for good amt of time, I hung up. Makemytrip may be good website/app providing lot options but my experience was nothing less than pathetic. After this experience I dont think I will ever use makemytrip. Adios MAKEMYTRIP",1

2220,"Recently I booked multi-destination domestic air tickets and hotel bookings through Make my Trip web site. In the first instance I booked Bangalore- Mumbai, Mumbai - Jammu and Jammu - Bangalore segments of my travel. once the dates were keyed in and fare confirmed, I was asked to provide my credit card details. Once the card transition was complete and bank confirmation received, I received the following confirmation from Make my trip: Booking for sector Bangalore- Bombay  failed and all other sectors confirmed. The amount of the fare for failed sector will be refunded. I Once again tried to book the failed sector but this time with Hotel stay in Mumbai. After going through the same process as in above booking, the final result was a message from Make my Trip stating that this booking has failed and the credit card money will be refunded.  This to me is strange occurrence which I have never faced with other international online travel  bookings. Accordingly I would appreciate if  Make my trip could clarify my following questions.: How come you take the full money from credit card( peoples money) with verifying that the actual booking is done or not. It is easy to say that refund will be paid within 5 working days - which means I do not have access to my money for another 5 days for no fault of mine. Every time I contact your toll free number, I am always told that your system is working slow so bear with us.

He understood my problem and promised me that he will call back and try his level best to sort this out for me. Within 15mins I got a call from him and he took my email address and sent me the amended ticket as well.Kudos to this guy.he saved me a lot of trouble and money. I think you guys proved the benchmark by recruiting such great people in your customer Service.,4
2226,Hello Make my trip is a best application for travelling and staying in hotels. It always gives so many offers like discount on ticket bookings and huge discounts on hotels. As we were planned to go Pondicherry we utilize these offers while travelling and hotel service. They gave 40% discount on hotel booking. Its a very good app which always satisfies the customer. The UI part of this application really impresses the customers. And a very trustable app. Yes one more thing it has one good offer that is if we have used make my trip for four times it will gives us one luxurious hotel for one night for free. It means they are providing Almost 5k amount free. That's so great of the them. Overall a best application for us I can say.,5
2227,"I planned to go goa with my friends.So I was looking for bus plus hotel service through several apps providing these type of services like goibibo, yatra. But I found that they are not giving exact offers what they suppose to give.Then I tried make my trip, after opening only you will see a cool and cachy first page.Hatts off for their UI. Then I booked a hotel by using the discount code and I got exactly 40% off as they were clamimg to give. They are famous offers is if you do four bookings using make by trip then you will get one free night in a hotel.So hurry don't miss the offer go and grab it",4
2228,Such a fraudulent system. Promising Rs. 500 cashback in 20 days and charging convenience fee without even notifying! Why would I book it witha travel agent if ticket is costing more than the original airline price. Baaad first and last experience! Cant call customer service(one of the 1800 numbers says switched off! lol). Inadequate information about pricing . That's a major loophole. I've tried numerous times to complete my profile and login but alas! failed!,1
2229,"Horrible processes and frustrating experience. So as long you have booked a ticket that does not need cancelation later or date change or something different, it will be alright because it will be all about how cute or thoughtful the website it. AND if you are one of those unfortunate people who needed some change after you have made the booking through this site then welcome to hell. If you call customer care: Be rest assured you will find rookies there, who will not be able to understand the nature of the problem. Change of date in your tickets? - Oh! for that you might need to wait for 3-4 days for us to revert etc. Escalation to supervisor right now? Sorry, no one senior is present right now . and so on . If you try website: Ah! too bad for you, it will say: customer care will need to call you. Only problem is - they will never call. Of course, you might receive a SMS from them that they tried calling you. Of course it does not matter if there was not a single missed call and even a missed call alert on your mobile from any number. So finally, you will need to end up calling them. Welcome to 1-2 hours of pure frustration. Once you have done all the explaining etc, they will feel sorry for all thet s* that happened to you and then will promise to resolve your problem in next 2-3 days which might or might not happen. So what the problem was - you simply wanted to change the travel dates.! So people, up to you on how you want to plan for your holiday etc, . for me: no way I will ever use this site.",1
2230,"This is the worst ever experience with make my trip, It was all smooth till all the transactions were happening correctly, they use to call for good ratings and feedback and all. One of My transaction got failedNF2204455981804for which they committed refund within 48 hrs, However the same was not done even till 96 hrs, After that when I checked for status they asked me to wait for more 96 Hrs, I waited on the faith that there might be some issue but now again after 2nd 96 hrs I get a mail stating to wait further more for another 96 hrs. In the era when we all are using NEFT and IMPS for fund transfer,  it seems Make my trip is using some other mode for the same. It is recommended to all that please use some other portal for booking tickets as if unfortunately the money got stuck you will require to wait for long time, Even I found that Indian railways which was treated as the slowest portal for ticket booking has a faster process flow for ticket booking and refund processing.",1
2231,"I regularly use this website for a trip. From flight tickets to hotel room bookings, this is one stop for making a trip happen. On the homepage itself, different categories are mentioned, which makes the searching process quite simple. The thing that I like the most about this site is that you can book packages. Till date my family and I, we've been on several trips planned through this site. Be it domestic or international trip, you can get great deals. I even love the flight plus hotel combo deals which turns out to be really cheap. Their customer service is great and have been really efficient and helpful in helping me plan the trips and make them happen. The website is easy to navigate and all the details and conditions are clearly highlighted. Once you become a member, you can even get great offers in your inbox. A really great site for making trips happen.",4
2232,"Well, I had a good as well as bad experience with makemytrip in the same trip. We organised a trip to gangtok via makemytrip and cost was comming to ?100000 each family. MakemyTrip laid us out the whole trip details with date and schedule. He furnished us the entire details of the trip and the tinest of the details and information and we were very much excited to go. But then earthquakes from nepal rocket the entire country and Gangtok was worst hit after nepal. We had prepaid the entire trip cost worth ?3 lakhs for 3 families and had to call the trip off because of the calamities. We contacted MakemyTrip for refunds and cancellations and was told that it was a non refundable Trip as it was in some offer. We then had to go with the usual schedule of the trip to save our ? 3 lakhs and left our home to board the train. But the worst thing is yet to come which shows a blunder from makemytrip. We left for our homes and were halfway to the station when makemytrip sent us a text stating that all individuals in the trip must carry their id proofs to continue with the trip and we hadnt brought id proof of children and women. We had to call our relatives up and ask them to rush our id proofs to the station causing harassment to them. The last minute reminder is a good system but informing about the thing not until last minute is very bad. Bottomline: I had a nice trip at gangtok even after the quakes which made me forget all the miseries of the trip.",4
2233,"I booked a ticket online and some how managed to put the wrong month by mistake. I was not sure how it happened. So I call customer service right away and the guy is not ready to listen to me, then he does finally hears me out and his reply is sorry sir we will not be able to do anything as our server is down. Then after a few days we call again and the customer service guy bluntly says NO! I ask to speak with the supervisor and the reply is again NO! I ask him again and the reply is he will call back. I get a call back but again the supervisor is not ready to listen NO! It is not about money it is how you interact with customers. Well he said he will call after 5 days which he did and the answer was no. My name is Jaskirat Randhawa my number is 7500993875 and I have proof that I called within 2 minutes of the transaction as I emailed the customer service guy within 10 mins of the transaction.  I would urge my friends to stop using make my trip and use some other customer friendly company. As make my trip  does not care about its customers. I personally will never use this website again and am sure that my friends and family will not either.",1
2234,"I have booked an international holiday with makemytrip. Since the begining, the cost of the package kept changing. The price went up by atleast 20%. But the issue isnt that. When we received the hotel vouchers I found out the that hotel booking added to be less than 4 days even though the package said 5days and 4 nights. Our date and time of arrival is 13th august 8.30 am but the hotel check in is at 2.00 pm . On the day of departure our check out time is 11.00 am on 17th august when our departure time is 11.00 pm on the same night. The customer service says it is as per international hotel standards. And any early check in or check out is subject to availability and chargeable which I wasnt informed about at the time of booking. I have written atleast 4 mails regarding this, But the is no response. I have raised a compliant on their portal and there is no response. All this even before we have travelled. I am expecting the worst from them during our vacation. Pathetic service with and bunch of idiots sitting at every level of service. The customer service guy I called was apparently from the operations team. He tells me the mistake was on the sales team side as they should have informed. Why the hell should I care which team made the mistake. For a customer makemytrip is one org. Its for them to sort out their issues.",1
2235,"We had booked 3 rooms with Saraai and Lonavala for the weekend(1st and 2nd August) through makemytrip.com 1) We wasted 5 hours because there was not a single sign board and the hotel refused to guide us 2) The staff was unapologetic and gave us only 2 rooms although we booked 3. One room was full of fungus, stinking and not a living condition. 3) The bedsheets had actual mud and hundreds of bugs &  insects in them. They were so dirty and unwashed from the previous booking. 4) One of the bathroom did not have a door. 5) We did not even spend 5 minutes in your property, nor did we stay there.

2236,"MakeMyTrip started out as a ticket aggregator. Then they started making hotel bookings. Now they offer holiday packages. Be careful before you entrust your precious holiday package to MakeMyTrip. They are not travel agents. They don't know the places you plan to visit,  nor the best season to go there, nor the times the roads are going to be clogged because of local events. They just want to sell you the package. When they sell you the package, you are not necessarily getting the best price; they don't bother to negotiate rates with hotels, etc the way you would if you were to do it yourself.

2238,"Hello. I would like to share my experience with Makemytrip.com in booking an e-ticket. I had used their service before, and it was good. Their algorithms helps us to find the cheapest way of travel. Here, I remember the general saying, "" We should judge a person at their bad times, and all behaves good in their perfect situation"". Here it goes, I booked an e-ticket in an airlines using makemytrip.com. Everything went fine till the money was paid using netbanking. Then the villain came as transaction failure due to some technical fault at makemytrip side. I confirmed the transaction failure with customer care and he suggested me to book another ticket, as the amount deducted will be refunded in 3 working days. He apologized me for the fault at their end. I got a mail confirmation from makemytrip saying my refund is submitted to bank, and it will be delivered to my account on the 3rd working day. Even though, they didn't give me service for the money blocked, I was happy that they took responsibility of their fault. To my surprise, I didn't receive the money after 10 working days. I got pissed off and called up the customer care executive. He said that the refund is not initiated from makemytrip end till now. I realized that the mail that they sent saying ""refund was submitted to bank"" was a fake one. I asked him to escalate the call to higher level. He confirmed me that their supervisor will call me in 2-3 hours. I didn't find any call back for 15 hours. So, I called them back to the customer care executive. Now, they are saying 7 more days for refund to be done. I wonder why don't they care for a customer's money.Will makemytrip allow me to book a ticket for which I can pay after 20 days. Is it legal for them to hold my money for these many days for their fault? I had called up the customer care many times, everyone replies with the same keywords - sorry, apology, refund in 3 days or 7 days, raised to concerned department. Do they really intend to refund the money, or this is the way they make profit by making cheap travel arrangements? A pained citizen,",1

2242,"Hi, I have a very bad experience with MakeMytrip.com service. I booked a round trip ticket for my entire family. While charging my credit card in dollars, they have given a very bad exchange rate( almost Rs. 5 less than market value per dollar). While booking, I have not seen any link which mentions the exchange rate. Because my child is sick, I have to change the dates.  When I called them, I was told that cancellation/postponement charges are same.  They never mentioned about Uncancel feature. Without realizing that there is a Uncancel feature,  I cancelled the trip. When I got the cancellation confirmation email, there are few words about Uncancel. So immediately( with in 2 min)  I called them  and the service rep does not seem to know that such a feature exists. Only when I read out the paragraph from their web site, she talked to her supervisor and said  that such a feature is available. When I talked to the customer rep for  some time about  my grievance, she simply gave me a number( it turned out to be a non working one) and asked me to call it. I asked her to forward me to that number as it should be internal to the company.,  she simply did some thing, which simply cut my call I tried calling the number she gave me(18001024813) atleast 10 times and every time it says "" The number you are trying to call is not accepting phone calls) So  here are my list of complaints about the web site and their customer service a) While uncancel is a good feature, they dont give that link in the email b) They charge very high dollar/Rupee exchange rate and dont mention the exact exchange rate/dollar charge in the web site. c) Customer service reps dont know about Uncancel feature till I read about the page in their web site back to them. They wont mention it when you enquire about cancellation/postponement policy. d) When I am trying to explain my complaints to them, they simply got rid of me by asking me to call a non working number. When I insisted that I should be forwarded to that number, they do some thing, which simply disconnects the call. Effectively they hung up on me I am very much disappointed with the whole process and when my child gets better and we travel again, I am definitely not using their site I guess their site is ok, if you are on a happy path.( no postponements, no changes, no mistakes). But if you run into any issue, you can't expect much understanding or support from them. Sailaja P.S: I am pretty sure, I will get insincere emails and apologies from  them. If they are too busy to talk to me about my grievance when I call their support line and hung up on me, I wont have time to read their insincere emails",1

On 05.06 15 to know the status of the booking I called make my trip and they said it is confirmed to cross check I called the hotel and the hotel said that there is no booking under my name and the hotel is completely booked out. When I contacted make my trip they were clueless and they said they will arrange a room which did not happen and they bought good 38 hours from me at the end they said that they were unable to find any accommodation in the entire city and they said it us my pain I will have to resolve my self. I was so very annoyed and I spoke to one of their client relationship officers called Preeti Chakroborty and the option what she fave was find a property for your self we will refund the existing booking amount and the difference hence I fetched an acoomodation by paying an extra 2500 rupees for which I submitted the bail and intact make my trip acknowledged and accepted the trip it is been more than 45 days since they said they will be refunding my hard earned money. I tried contacting Preeti through email and phone she neither responding for the emails nor calls. I would say it is an absolute white collar smuggling and I have no clue about my money. I am just one of the victims however there are thousands who doesn't know how to express their experience with this smuggling company. People please be care full because they will make u beg and cry on phone which has happened with me in past I mean the sameday.,1

And this time, when I had to change my flight dates due to an emergency, I had the worst nightmare of my life! I had to spend more than 2 and half hours on call just to get the dates changed. One of the most funny and equally annoying part that happened was that none. mind my words - ""NONE"" of the representatives I spoke to had any idea about how to help me. I had called them 4 times to get the date change done and all the 4 times they kept transferring my call from one person to another with one same statement ""Allow me to transfer your call to the concerned department, "" and guess what, it took me 4 calls and almost 2.5 hours to reach the ""CONCERNED DEPARTMENT."" There were times when my call was actually transferred to the same person again and again after he/she had already transferred the call to another representative. I actually felt like that ""PARCEL"" in passing the parcel game! I mean seriously? The app doesn't work, the website is crap, I cannot rely on calls to seek help, how the hell does a customer approach you?

I have tried to search information in Google and got MakeMyTrip. I have used this site for clear all doubt. I have booked some hotel for stay in tour via this site because good promotion offer running by this site. This site have good idea and system for make easy process of find any hotel or route as well book bus ticket, flight or taxi and hotel. MakeMyTrip have good customer service for help all user. I am happy with using this site and love to deal for book my hotels via this website.",4
2258,"Their website terminated connection to the Bus service providers system and was unable to  provide me with a ticket. they asked me to re-book. But the previous transaction amount was not fully returned by MMT, although they mentioned otherwise over the phone with me. On second instance, and the discount coupon applied by MMT deducted the total amount in the screen but charged me the full amount.Although I still use it, but I do feel vulnerable everytime I am purchasing at Make my trip recently.",1
2259,"In my opinion makemytrip.com is one of the best sites for your holiday planning thing. This is also one of the oldest and reliable also. You land up on their homepage and your confusion is gone. They will let you select right options very easily.I also compared the rates offered here with other websites> They are not the best but they are good enough. Simple UI that is design makes it really simple what you want to get into.  You want to book a flight, book a hotel or something else. Homepage is so well organised not like other websites. I remember their homepage was also cluttered some time back.but now it is very user friendly.",4
2260,"Makemytrip is an online travel website to book bus, flights and also trains. well its hard to book train from IRCTC, and harder to book with makrmytrip. I have seen many reviews expressing slow, transaction not executed etc, but I am lucky most of the time that so far I have not faced any problem with make my trip. I usually use it to book flights. It also has its mobile app, which is very good. Mostly when required I look for different travel website offering good price and discounts, and choose based on the lowest price I have to pay. I think most people I know does that. So always check coupons & discounts available before transaction. there are always some deals available on MakeMyTrip.com.",3
2261,"Really a worst service I received by MakeMyTrip(IN1503B9So84334). Based on the reviews got I chose MMT. Promises and commitments they will be giving will not be followed as it is. My personal experience in between our Himachal Tour, whatever the CAB services assign to refuses to shows us site. Event after making hundreds of complaints to MMT it is of no use. Every time they are providing some different solution but unfortunately didn't work anything at all for me. Finally MMT decided to give me vouchers for the inconvenience caused to me which was expected to deliver to me in 21 days after tour ends. But still those 21 days are not ending. We are paying to any tour company for our enjoyment not for the these kind of frustration behind us. After the whole tour completion I didn't received a single call from MMT. And also I am not getting response to my call. Finally I decided to keep my wife enjoying the tour, kept myself happy as well. but what is outcome of all this if you are not feeling satisfied even after paying huge amount? It was just like robbing the money from customer for me. I believe don’t make such fake promises and commitments that we can’t complete. I have all the evidences to prove this owrst service.",1

2263,"My father, Satyajit Sen insists on using Make My Trip because he felt it was convenient and safe even though he knew it is cheaper to book from the airline site directly. Over yesterday and today that impression has been turned on its head! We had two individual bookings from Bangalore to Pune on 3rd July. Due to an accident of a relative the plans needed to be changed so we tried cancelling our tickets. My father's ticket was cancelled but mine would not be processed despite several cancellation requests, causing us to lose almost all the money spent on both flight tickets. Worst of all, we were unable to change the booking because the website showed an error page every time we clicked on'Modify Booking' and I couldn't postpone the ticket. The rate for cancellation changes drastically is less than 48hrs remain for the flight, so beware! We had to cancel directly with the airline. Don't wait for Make My Trip to work, just cancel directly with the airline after the second or third attempt and no confirmation SMS.",1
2264,"Worst site, I have ever seen.I have not able to print my E-Ticket.Neither I am able to check the status of my cancelled ticket. Really frustrated.  Also when I called customer support, thay are not ready to log the complain. I will suggest to stay away in case of International Flight Bookings. I would call it as a worst site. If anone is going to book online booking. You can expect a high charges than other site and will compell uu to call customer support to get best price. Customer Support willinsist you to take tickets as soon as possible else price will rise. Also sometime supervisor will also and provide you with some offers. But this is reverse in case of cancellation or refund, The rsponse will be that the supervisor is not on floor .",1
2265,"Recently I booked a honeymoon package to maldives. There are lot of problems I faced in this trip that too in a honeymoon trip, which happens once at a life time for all. I'm completely frustrated about their arranagements during the trip. Listing out the problems I faced one by one here First of all they booked the flight & room and sent me the confirmation sheet. Before my departure day, I called the toll free number also the personal who booked the package just to ask them what and all documents I have to carry for this trip, but both didnt pick the call. The toll number number just ringing.ringing.ringing. No use. For this itself I got tensed and carried all the documents which I had. Successfully we reached maldives airport. As soon as I got down I went to the money exchange counter to change my 25k rupees, where 2nd shock was waiting for me, that Indian rupee is not accepted in maldives. My tension became very high, that in an unknown country without single bugs who to manage. Then after a long struggle I got a free WIFI, using which I conveyed my friend to inform my parents to put 10k in my account. Once the amount is transfer I took maldives currency(Maldivan Rufiyaa) from ATM in which 1200 rupees is wasted in transaction fee. Then we reached the resort. They explained the features in the resort, I was happy to see the free offers for honeymoon couples by the resort. After seeing the offers the asked them that when can this be utilized. The 3rd shocking is that the receiptionist replied that ""We have booked a room, but not mentioned as honeymoon package."" I got frustrated there. Then he advised me to contact the agent and get the confiramtion from them. Out of country. No network, no new sim, even direct calling they are not picking, then how come using the WIFI/mail I can catch them. Thinking this all, I left the place in sorrow. Drinking water is chargable in Maldives. 1.5L of water is$5(almost Rs.300). Each day buying 2 water bottles. so almost$50 wasted in our complete. On our final day the greatest shocking news is that our complete bill in our stay. I'm not trying to say its costlier. The shock is that the resort is not accepting the Maldivan Rufiyaa. The whole Maldives Resorts accepts only US dollars even in airport they wont accept the Maldivan Rufiyaa. Finally after a long fight we paid the$600 amount in our credit card. Maldivan Rufiyaa is only used by local people for small kind of transactions, unfortunately airport to island and island to aiport is freely provided by concern resort, you will not able to see any local shops in-between this travel.  So I amount we got through ATM is now utter waste. Thank god once person who was working in the resort is from South India who helped me to exchange the Maldivan Rufiyaa to US dollars in the last time otherwise all that amount is waste, because in maldives airport and in india also they wont accept their currency. Let me tell you one more thing, in our whole journey from Chennai to Maldives a family came along with us to the same resort, to the same type of room we booked and returning with us in the same plane. We had few time to talk with them. After talking to them I got few more informations that they also got booked this package using a local agent(not makemytrip) who charged 25K less than us. Who gave clear idea that only US dollars is accepted in Maldives, that they insisted them to change in India itself as Indian Rupees is not accepted in Maldives. Also the local agent advised them to carry at least 20L of water in main luggage and dresses in another luggage. I wondered a local agent gave this much of information to the passenger but why not the MAKEMYTRIP. Worst Worst Worst. Guys please dont ever go for Makemytrip",1
2266,"I booked bus from Katra to Amritsar with makemytrip.com. it was horrible experience, The name of bus was Golden temple volvo bus but it was discarded bus site charge twice of actual fare bus operator force to share the seat with other person Take extra money.

2267,"I booked a tour package(ID IN1505B1S139112) of Jammu & Kashmir with Makemy trip in the month of June 2015. The concerned person for my booking was Mr Navin Gangwani. Dear friends I would to mention that it was the worst experience for me. It was mentioned in the Package Itinerary that on arrival, you will be welcomed by a MakeMyTrip representative, but during the entire trip no body from Makemy trip contacted me. Only one vehicle and driver was sent  without any details as tour was being manged my myself only. I was telling the driver to what to see after exploring from internet. Hotels were also provided  far from the sights. Further I would like to mention that one day of return from Srinagar my flight was cancelled and and I tried to contact makemy trip and it socked to me that they were not responding from HQ, everybody was telling that I will come back after 5 minutes and I was waiting at airport for 4hrs. Finally they did not gave any solution they told me, talk to airport authority about the reschedule of flights  and go to any Hotel and pay the amount and we will reimburse you Rs 2000 per room. Luckily indigo airlines after 4hrs rescheduled  my ticket for next day. Makemy Trip being an airlines travel agent didn't helped me at all even though I was on a package tour. Whereas all other travel agent came at airport to help their customer and provided proper accommodation for them. So friends whenever you are booking any package tour beware from make my trip.",1
2268,Makemytrip is the best portal for booking the ticket. I use to book all my ticket online using makemytrip. I often use to travel from Ahmadabad to Delhi for the business purpose. And I use to book through this. Well my dates are flexible. So I choose the cheapest flight from Ahmadabad to Delhi. Also some time I do travel by train. But the booking I do is from makemytrip if it is not an tatkal. For the tatkal ticket I choose irctc.co.in. That is best for tatkal. And for other booking this is good one.,4

2271,"Dear Friends, I wish to share my pathetic experience with MAKE MY TRIP. Please note that it’s an absolutely irresponsible and unprofessional organisation. You can be sure that even after booking confirmation from Make My Trip; you may not get air ticket or refund of money. You will tire chasing the most unprofessional staff seating at call centre. You will not be able to contact any responsible person directly from Make My Trip. If you complain by mail you will only receive computer generated reply. Nobody will provide you contact details of responsible entity. Nobody will call you back and solve your problem. I am narrating my own experience with authenticity to ensure that friends and other travellers do not suffer: 1-    Make My Trip Booking ID NF220xxxxx4983 - Cancellation Request Confirmation Refund of Rs.2323/- pending since July 2014 2-    Make My Trip Reference ID:[150xxx-xx5040] Booking ID NF22044xxxxx873 – Received confirmed ticket from make my trip, but at airport airlines declined my booking and I am forced to purchase new tickets. Refund of Rs.9791/- is pending since March 2015. 3-    MakeMyTrip Booking ID - NN230171xxxxx524 – Received confirmed booking from make my trip but no air tickets. Now they say that due to technical reason they cannot issue the ticket. Fact remain that Airfare has gone up by almost Rs.6000/- Refund of Rs.20000/- is still under process. As a regular traveller now I realized that, it’s always better to pay little more amounts to travel agent instead of doing on line booking. At least with travel agency you can talk to someone who is reliable and responsive. If you consider this message useful, please spread it. Thanks, best regards. Aditya Ajmera",1
2272,"I wish no one should go through the hurdles that we went through by making booking through ""MakeMyTrip"". My trip plan was for 5 days, 6 nights thursday night reached Delhi, from where package tour started. They booked good hotel at Delhi. Friday whole day we roamed at Delhi, car booking for 5 days was done by makemytrip. next Day Saturday went to Agra, left morning 6 and reached by 11. From agra we done in 2 hours. By 2pm we left from agra to reach Chandighad. Reached chandighad by 10.30 pm. And there was stay at Metro 35 near by market. Hotel was ok. Next day Sunday was day journey to Manali, started morning 6 am and reached manali by 7pm. Hotel booked was Dream Land River. Rooms were stinking bit. otherwise they were ok. We had next day, i.e Monday sight seeing for Rotang pass which is snow point at Manali. Tuesday again back to Delhi Day journey. Package cost excluding airfare 40, 000/- Airfare cost separate: 32000/- to and pro for couple. In this package if you consider Manali trip for us, was single day i.e Rotang pass. All the way we went from Delhi to Manali just for rotang pass. The day we reached Manali, it was evening 7 pm, driver said, we have to check for ""Rotang pass"". I asked why we have to check, as I paid for package and makemytrip dint say anything to US while booking. Then driver checked by himself and came back and said, he is not getting pass and we need to make our own arrangements. I called makemytrip customer care, and I got so bad response, I just can't explain. Customer care just keep shifting calls between departments and at each department we should explain problem from start, with booking ID. I was fed up calling. Before booking they used to call and value my time. The person who is point of contact for my booking also dint respond when I call. No bady bothered after taking money from me. They dint even bother aboubt the promise that they maid while taking booking for trip. I struggled badly to get tickets for Rotang, finally could not get the tickets. My whole plan for trip to Manali went waste because of makemytrip. If I have to struggle so much at Manali for Rotang pass, why should I make prior booking through ""Makemytrip""? Whose responsibility is it to make us go through Rotang, when they say it is covered in package? Makemytrip collected money from us, by making promise of covering ""Rotangpass"". When we asked them to refund they said they never came back. Whole trip cost is nearly 75, 000. I think I made mistake by choosing makemytrip. I never prefer anyone to go through Makemytrip. Totally if I would arrange by myself, I would have covered trip in just 50k with airfare. I paid 20 more to makemytrip, just hopping they do all arrangements properly, and I can enjoy trip. I was wrong. So becareful before you make trip with makemytrip. Keep in mind they never going to respond once you done with booking. Think more before you loose your saving of many years. Apart from this at chandighad hotel, when we were about to checkout, they were not allowing us to checkout without paying. They said make my trip dint make payment, even though we paid to makemytrip. Humm. they wasted early morning one hour. Finally customer care took call and said they will pay on monday and they should let us go. Thanks god we continued to Manali. Is this way they handles hotel booking for customers? Driver we had was lazy & worst. He was from prateek travels he said. His name Sanjay. Makemytrip booked this driver from ""Dev bhoomi travels"". This lazy driver, for every place in package, he said only one thing to us ""there is nothing to see in that place"". He just want to miss the places. He used to ask money from US, by making some or the other reason. On paper they keep many places and actully they cover less. So becareful to take couple package with separate car. If we would have gone with BUS packages, then there would have been many to question makemytrip.Now we only 2 so they neglect. But I wont sit quite, I will write my experience in all the social hubs, so that some people will be alert with makemytrip cheating. This is not only our problem, I met 2 other couple from bangalore at Manali, who had same response towards Makemytrip arrangements. So I suggest to think before risk your trip.",1
2273,"I travelled from Ahmedabad to Goa and the package given by makemytrip was very attractive and we had an hassle free journey. The experience was great as it was easily to find the hotels at Goa in my budget. I checked up the images on makemytrip and other sites as well. I booked them and made travel arrangements from makemytrip. The tour guides were very professional, thoughtful and helpful.  We had wonderful experience with makemytrip. It is a great customer service and worth the money. I absolutely love the site. The information system and knowledge base is quite impressive on makemytrip. I used to book all my  flight and bus tickets through makemytrip only. Overall whole site is very impressive. Thanks  makemytrip for making my journey pleasant. The site is amazing with the best discounts offered in the industry.",4
2274,"I made my first transaction on make my trip about a month back for a trip my brother was making to Dehradun. I made to and fro flight booking and a hotel booking. The overall booking experience was great, the deal on flight was not mind-blowing but was ok, it come to 23k to and fro for economy flight from kochi(jet onward and air india back). The hotel booking was much better as the array on hotels on display is really vast and here additional discounts were also available. The booking process in general is  a breeze and the overall ui is good. Now my brother has done the onward travel and is staying at the hotel and there was hiccups to either two. And even when I made the booking I was doubtful of choosing Air india for all the bad press they had but the price difference was substantial and time of travel also half compared to nearest deal. Also as I was depending on a travel agent I thought they would ensure trouble free travel. But what I dreaded has now happened. I got a mail that his flight that was scheduled for 19:40 on 26th has been rescheduled to 13:30 and when I checked online it was a completely different flight. And now he has to stay overnight at delhi airport for over 12 hrs and as it is overnight they wont allow him to check in and use the terminal. He is literally stranded. I contacted the make my trip customer care, after waiting for about 15 min the guy informed it was technical fault with air india and I should contact them and he literally hung up after asking me to wait again when asked for clarity. If I have to deal with the airline then why do I have the need for a travel agent. And to add to all that the site was still selling tickets for the 19:40 flight.  They are charging a tonne for us to reschedule our flights and there is not even a proper explanation when they do so. I don't want any monetary compensation, just assurance that he wil have trouble free travel and if possible an accommodation for his overnight stay. My worst fear is that there wont be any flight to board.",2
2275,I am been using makemytrip.com. This is the best website I had  every found on internet. It gives all king of booking on a single click. Also I like the top bar of the website. It shows all the fares of the plane. And I can easily choose the date when there is a low cost fare and also the time. It have support with all the airlines company. Also I can book a ticket of a train from this site. It is also an alternative for irctc.com. But this site is having some comission in booking. Not in all the booking but in some booking it having. Overall I love this website and it is awesome I had ever found on internet for travelling etc.,5

2280,Used Makemytrip for booking my wife's and daughter journey which became nightmare for me now. Itinerary was Pune to Kolkata 6th May 5:55AM in indigo and then Kolkata to Silchar 6th May 10AM in Air india. Booking was done in Feb 2015. Now by March 2015 Air india changed its flight schedule from 10AM to 5:50 Am on 6th May which is the same time as the Indigo flight from Pune to Kolkata. I called up Makemytrip and they took conference call with Air india customer care where they didn't gave me any alternate option for the same day but they were ready for full refund which Makemytrip also agreed to do the same. This interaction I had in the month of March and since then harassment cycle going on. I got my Indigo and Air india refund with cancellation charges which I completely understand for Indigo but till now(June 2015) I am trying to understand why I had been charged cancellation for Air india where I was not in Fault at all. I have been interacting with all Makemytrip executives till all now for getting my full refund for Air india flight which they understand in call and mail but action is missing. I have escalated matter to their Management as well but NO ANSWER yet(ref id:150408-021325). Only thing I am getting is that they understood the issue. But matter of the fact is I am more concern about my Hard earned money which they have taken illegally! I have running pillar to post for getting my full refund from Makemytrip and the only thing I am getting is another assurance. Not sure of others but I am surely skip Makemytrip for any bookings in the future. Thanks Makemytrip for opening my eyes! Cheers Shank,1

It arranges, for you, flight tickets, Carriers, hotels and other important necessities, exigencies and needfulness. At the appointed time , the vehicle is there , the man paging you at the airport or the railway station, you receive  guiding messages many times during your itinerary. They are a bit flexible too. Moreover the they can tailor the itinerary as per your budget. In case of any difficulty they have counter parts at destinations who solve all your small or bigger problems.

2282,"I want to share my experience with the travel agency Make My trip. I can vouch-safe that this is a company which means business. Promise is promise. No hanky panky. Be it the concern of flights, hotels, carrier or any other contingency , the company never shows back. At the appointed time, the man paging you is there, Tip-top vehicle awaits you. At the hotel the staff awaits you. Welcome drink, guidance at the counter is refreshing from long journey or flight. Every term and condition of the itinerary is word of the mouth for the organizers.

2283,"Booking id: IN1505B1S139294 Worst experience with Makemytrip. I traveled to Bangkok and Pataya with my family& kid. I did booking 1 week before& explained the plan completely. Once the aishwaryasingh23ment is done. You won't get any support as per your plan& request. There'll be lot of mis-communication or false commitment from them. God sake after reaching Bangkok I took local mobile no. Otherwise it would have been nightmare for the entire trip. All they provided sub standard trasfers, you are traveling with family and you need to sit in different places in the vehicle. I booked the travel for 3 nights in pattaya and 3 days Bangkok. First day reached Bangkok, Makemytrip executive took us to nearby hotel for the breakfast in a good vehicle. From Bangkok to Pattaya, they asked us to board different vehicle. I refused and asked for the different vehicle. You need to argue with the executive to get a good vehicle. I got it finally. Reached pattaya around 12:30PM and checked in the hotel. We took rest. Had lunch and evening we went to tiffany show with transfers. Day is end. Second day to coral island. We were waiting in the lobby by 8AM. Makemytrip executive called and updated you were not in the lobby. My wife and kid were waiting in the lobby. I just went for a collecting water bottle in my room by the time driver left without picking up us. After I called the executive driver came back and picked-up us. 9AM we started pattaya. I clearly conveyed before my trip. I would like to spend more time in coral island. Makemytrip made me and my family to wait near paraglide upto 12PM. We were totally not interested in this. Since they claim it's SIC. but mine was customized. They left us in coral island by 12:45PM. No arrangements for change. By the time we look for change room, it'll be 1:15PM. 2PM makemytrip forced us to come back and board the boat to go back pattaya. Otherwise they mentioned you have to come on your own.Common we went for the purpose of coral island and you are allowing us to stay there for 45 minutes to enjoy the beach. Day went totally waste. Cameback to pattaya to have worst lunch arrnged by them. They left us back in the hotel by 4PM and asked us enjoy your rest of the day. What a waste of international travel. Anyways we enjoyed shopping post evening as we were frustrated with Makemytrip plan. Third day we went to tiger zoo. They gave us very worst transfer. Where we sat in the last seats of the vehicle and it's sub standard seats. By noon 12:30 PM We were forced to return. I had fullday plan in the zoo. This was conveyed earlier to makemytrip.  But they claim there is no such communication. Purpose totally went wrong. Rest of the day I planned myself with my own expenses for other activities. Fourth Day starts. Actual plan was to reach Bangkok early. Before travel I clearly conveyed i'm not interested in GEMS gallery. We started Pataya with a very sub standard quality vehicle. To our luck again back seat. Wasted time till 11AM in the GEMs gallery. Left pattaya around 11AM. reached watpho temple in bangkok around 1PM. 1:40 PM we were asked to board back after temple roundsup. We came back around 1.35PM. We were already knowing it won't take much time. To our luck other travelers of my vehicle they returned back by 2:30PM.  Now the plan was to reach our hotels in Bangkok. Driver doesn't know the route. He mislead to some other hotel. Through google map I showed the way to other travelers and driver to reach their hotel. Finally it's my turn again through Google map I helped driver to reach my hotel. This makemytrip and ITC guys claims SIC. By the time we reached hotel it was 4:15 PM. What a waste of time for the day. Rest of the day I planned for cruise dinner. ITC guys asked me to be ready by 5:45 PM. No one turned out upto 6:30 PM. ITC Executive called me and updated. Sir please come on your own to cruise place with taxi. Some how I reached on time and taxi amount was returned back to me by ITC. So rest of the day enjoyed with cruise and dinner. Fifth day Safari world. Boarded @ my hotel 8AM. They took us to another hotel to pickup other travelers and came back and passed through the same hotel where i'm staying. What a waste of time. My plan was to stay safari world for fullday as per initial plan. 2:30PM Safari world safar ends. They'll convey either you'll be leaved to your hotels or shopping place. Executive asked us to board in a vehicle where you have to sit in different seats of the vehicle. Finally me, my wife and kid. All three sat one beyond the other in the sub standard vehicle.  Rest of the day enjoyed our own with shopping and dinner. Sixth day. SIAM World and madam tussauds. We went on our own and completed the visits by noon. Had lunch at MBK and did shopping in MBK and platinum mall. I clearly mentioned to makemytrip before the teavel itself. I'm booking extra day in bangkok hotel just to check out late in the hotel so that I can have sufficient time. My flight is next day 2AM.and they planned to leave the hotel by 6PM in the previousday. What i've to do 8 hrs in the airport.? Checkin in the airport happens only after 11:30PM for 2PM Flights. I got a call by 6:30 PM. Sir you should be in the hotel. Otherwise you need to come on your own to airport.  After giving clear information for my timings to leave the hotel by 9PM. They didn't arranged the vehicle. I went on my own. I paid 900 Baht for the transfers. I checked out the hotel by 9:30PM and reached airport by 10:05PM. Waited till 11.30PM for the check in. So finally reached back india with lots of time mis mAnasultangement from makemy trip and their tour operator ITC in bangkok. I conveyed several times to PREMA LATHA,  makemytrip executive regarding my plan. Till the booking for everything Ok sir. Once the aishwaryasingh23ment is done, all the communication will not reach to the tour mAnasultanger. I sent couple of mails to Devashish prabhakar. Not bothered to reply any of the mails. He is tour mAnasultanger. I traveled morethan 100 times to other countries for business trip. This was my first holiday trip with my family. They made us totally uncomfortable. I would have gone on my own. I paid higher side of amount since my travel booking happened 9 days before. Flight price is fine. But after aishwaryasingh23ing land cost at higher side. Service from makemytrip trip unsatifactory. Need to think before choosing next travel with Makemytrip. If you are ready with unlimited frustration and ready to face all these circumstances then makemytrip is the one. In mouth shut I don't have an option for less than a single star otherwise I would have selected that.",1
2284,"Make my trip is the worst tour and travels service I have came across. The biggest problem is that there is no co-ordination between their customer care executive team, every time you have to repeat your issue whenever you call them, and believe me they are not at all serious about customer issues. They will just keep on saying - wait for 24 / 48 / 72 hrs, we will get back to you. But call back never happens. They are fooling customer and robbing them of their hard earned money! I won't recommend anybody Make My Trip.",1
2285,"I was planning a vacation with family and it was almost at the last moment I was making flight bookings through MakeMyTrip at about 2 at night.  There were in all 3 tickets which I wanted to book and I though of making the booking one by one. First I booked the ticket in my name, Second I booked the ticket in my Wifes name.  But to my surprise when I saw the ticket copy over my email immediately after booking, it was shown my name in the name of passenger.  Just at the same time when I was making the 3rd booking in my sons name and just before payment the website gave me an alert saying I already have the booking in the same name, and then I realised that such alert never popped up when I was making the 2nd booking, and because of some technical error it was again and again selecting the same name for booking inspite of me selecting different name. Immediately when I called up the customer care, on listening to my issue they replied we cannot do any thing at the moment and you need to book a fresh ticket and cancel this ticket.  Also the refund that I was eligible on this ticket was only about Rs.780 and around Rs. 10500 will get deducted as cancellation charges of airlines and makemytrip. If the customer service guy wanted they could have easily resolved the said issue and this 10500 could have been saved, but no was interested in resolving. Since that day onwards till date I have been writing emailed to them and requesting them to call me and understand what and how things went wrong, but till date no one is bothered to give me a call back and just refused to refund my full amount, inspite of the fact that thewrong booking happened because of technical ERROR IN THE WEBSITE. This kind of attitude of a Travel Portal clearly shows that they are just not bothered about what customer has to go through. They are just not interested in even taking an effort to resolve customer issues as they know customer will not do any thing wrong to them for such a small amount. I suggest everyone reading this should just stop using this website and every one known should also be told not to use this website. Also one every important thing I came to know is, when you book the flight tickets through this website you don't get full milage point and it is almost like 50% of what you would get if you book through direct website of the airlines.",1

I got my reservation and also received confirmation mail and SMS. But when I reached ISBT, I came to know that there is no confirmation from Make my trip to UPSRTC. My seat was occupied from other person. I called customer care and explained him the situation, he said that he will register my complain and I will get solution in next 24 hours. How can a person wait for 24 hours when he is going to board for his journey with luggage? The worst service I have experienced from Make my trip. Imagine how it will feel, when you have spend your money, your time and your efforts but you are not getting proper services.

Even after registering they don't send spam messages in mailbox unlike other service providers. I have nice experience with makemytrip and I always get best price on this website.

2289,"We reach out to holiday planners when we don't have time to invest in planning but are ready to shell out for the same. I booked Amazing Ladakh with Pangong Stay Deluxe package from Bangalore. I didn't get my itinerary till the last minute and I found it extremely stressful in reaching out to the makemytrip support. I always heard the automated response of high call volume. Somehow managed to get the itinerary after wasting enough time waiting for my query to be answered. This was not the end of it. When I reached Delhi, there was no one to receive us. We somehow managed to locate a makemytrip stall at the airport and got dropped to the ibis hotel. When we reach ibis hotel, we are greeted by a tour manager who informs us that we need to wait at the lounge for 6 hours before we head to airport for departing to Leh. This was a completely a bad surprise, as in the itinerary we were promised a stay at the ibis hotel along with the meal plan. After back and forth arguments with the tour manager, we were given the accommodation at the hotel. Did we really have to go through this trauma for the price we paid? Quite a bad start for the holiday and a big turnoff. I would never go with makemytrip for any holiday in future. I fell for their brand name. I wanted to save some time, but ended up wasting time and added stress as well.",1

I'm going to have to take them to court. Please be careful while using their websites if you need to use it at all.

I had paid 110$ fee plus some taxes for the amendment and the end result was that We missed our flight, visa money, hotel money n not to forget the mental torture we went through was unbearable.according to the emirates airlines , it's in the hand of the travel agent to make the necessary changes in the names and other details too.they explained each and every step to Mr Singh n numerous other people but nothing was done No one took any interest in giving us a solution .i was promised a call back from their supervisors miss Neha jaswal and Mr Nitin Agarwal but never heard from them.

2300,"I have always planned my travel trips myself and this was the first time I thought of taking a package tour from Make My Trip(Magical Ladakh Super Saver Package with Pangong Stay-23rd May to 30th May’2015-Ref ID: IN1503B9S049044). I must say that Make My Trip did not leave a single chance of disappointing and disgusting me on my 8 days and 7 nights tour to Ladakh. I was with my family and wanted the best treatment for them on their vacation to the point that I booked a personal vehicle for them by paying extra. I was amazed with the sight of mismanagement and unprofessionalism though I was referred to them by one of their old customer’s who took the same package last year in June and received excellent service. The only thing expected out of Make My Trip was to take care of our travel, food and stay to ensure comfort and ease and it's unbelievable how it was all ruined. • My itinerary said accommodation in a standard hotel. I was put up in a home stay with not even a proper breakfast menu(as per them, the only thing make my trip agreed for breakfast was toast, butter, jam and eggs for all 7 days) and let’s not get to the serving time. If I were to order a tea, it was served at least an hour later. Towels and bed sheets were not even replaced until requested, forget about providing other toiletries. Before leaving for Pangong, I was asked to pack my luggage and keep it in the room only and hand over the keys. When we came back the next day after a tiring journey of 6-7 hours, there was nobody to attend us. We were stranded outside sitting on the staircase for good 15-20 minutes, I had to call up all the numbers I had on my phone, post which we were given room keys to a different room and our luggage had been shifted. The new room allocated was short of lot of things which I had to order all over again, not to mention that the old room was bigger and had a better view and was probably the reason why it was allotted to the new guests. • I had paid extra for a separate cab as I mentioned earlier but I was requested to share my vehicle with 3 others for 2 days on the 3rd day of my travel. • The tour manager was sitting in his office while we were stuck on the road for 5 hours in a non moving vehicle on our way to Nubra Valley at a check post. If they have been operating for so long then I am sure all the guides and tour managers must be aware of what is the normal course of action in situations when there's a snowfall and a series of vehicles are not able to progress. Neither were we intimated about this as a possibility beforehand nor anybody could tell us what our next steps were. We saw if not less about 50 vehicles returning and only and only make my trip passengers waited to receive orders for return because the drivers were incapable of making such a decision and there was no guide vehicle as promised by the tour manager. • Our itinerary stated that if we were to miss places like Nubra Valley on the designated day because of weather conditions then they will try and fit in those plans some other day,  if weather permits during the trip. The tour manager stated clearly that it was not possible to get bookings done on any other day to the place and we can't complete the journey in a day's time so it was out of itinerary. • The lunch that was served during Pangong visit was beyond imagination. An open area where just one old man is running the show, people shouted at him as they are starving and irritated because of the 5-6 hours long journey and cold. The lunch that was supposed to be hot lunch was hardly hot because of the chill outside and on top of it one didn't know what they are having was food or dust. Such unhygienic conditions were beyond me. By the way, the lunch served had 3 items namely rice, a lentil and a mixed veg item which was hardly edible. • It's worth talking about the stay in Pangong too. After a 10-11 hours journey, we arrived at the destination. The guy in charge said that our allocated camps were full and as a good gesture they will try and fix up something for us. The other camp was away from the lake however with no definitive plan as you can see and the chill outside we didn’t have any other option. • Tour guide and tour manager who only came for briefing every night seem to be incapable of decision making or conveying anything confidently. All this while, we did not come across a single person who you could call a guide or manager as mentioned during our outings or even a small banner saying Make my trip on the cars or anywhere for that matter. I simply took it as that the guys were too ashamed off letting anybody know about who they are and very rightly the mismanagement is the only thing expected. • I wrote mails to make my trip during my stay in Ladakh on 26th May and 29th May. I came back and lodged a complaint on the website on 30th May. I tried reaching out to my travel specialist on 1st June but I was not transferred to him and asked to state my issue after showing much patience of being on hold for over an hour to get through an agent. All in vein as  the other agent disconnected the phone after placing me on hold without permission. I receive a mail today like several other mails I received in the past stating that I will be contacted in the next 24 hours however this time there’s a new reason attached saying that my query was directed to a wrong department and now is being redirected to the correct department for resolution. I am still expecting a call back from Make My Trip and expecting a refund of my money which I would like to candidly state as Rs.1, 35, 000/- and which everybody would understand is not a small amount and definitely was not the worth. I work with a customer service company too and maintain highest standards for the same so I know what it means. Make My Trip has a detractor for rest of their life and I will ensure that I spread the word across. Alas, it was my birthday trip, thanks for ruining the same to the core. Regards Priyanka",1

2302,"I'm writing this to post my complaint about Makemytrip money refund process. I always used to do booking from Makemytrip website and almost every time as planned my journey used to happen. Recently for the first time I have cancelled my one hotel booking, Booking ID NH210615324175 prior well in advance and everything went smooth. I got mail from makemytrip in an hour to submit the bank account details where my refund amount will be processed deducting there cancellation charges. After submitting account details got mail that the refund details submitted to bank and will be processed in next 2 days and the same refund status I can check on my makemytrip account. After almost a week when I checked the status of my refund on my Makemytrip account it showed amount refunded on 22nd May 15 but in real no money was refunded back. I called customer care and on check they informed refund is actually pending from Makemytrip and there is something wrong showing in my account and the refund will take some 1-2 days. On 5th day I again called customer care and there was some lady who on interrogation and multiple layer of checkup said that the refund is not even initiated from them and she will escalate this to their account team. A Reference ID: [150529-051935] was been generated and mail was triggered to my id and they informed it will be resolved in next 72 days. Next day against my reference number the status was shown as been resolved which was very shocking. I want to escalate this to their level 2 but that doesn’t even works. Any complaint cannot be raised on makemytrip site as it will always end with same kind of error ”Opps something went wrong”.Trust me it nevers works, any time of the day or night. I don’t know is the site deliberately designed in that way where you cannot post your complaint or cannot escalate any pending issues. Only booking is done very smooth.I dont think holding refund money is MMT strategy of generating revenue. The only options lies is to call their customer care executives who always repeats the same line that we are working on your case and will get back to you shortly but no one comes back and if you mail them the revert is always automated machine generated which is very frustrating. So far my case is pending. Never thought this Simple straightforward refund from makemytrip will be such troublesome. Please treat this as Informative on the areas of Improvements and actions which is required, and I am not blaming any individuals who are putting their hard works.

I have called and sent emails several times. now there is exactly 9 days and they haven't explained what is happening or fixed the issue.  I got few responses back that seems they didn't even read my complaint.When I call I hear the same story that it has been forwarded to the concerned department and it will be fixed in 6 hours and again and again nothing is done. I don't know anymore how many times I have escalated the issue.I am very sad with makemytrip and I wouldn't recommend their site. I really don't think they will solve my issue. Seems like they want me to cancel so they can keep the cancellation fee or something like that. I hope they get back to me soon or I will have to find ways to get my money back as I don't think is fare if I had to pay anything to cancel this incorrect ticket. Take care with this company.,1

2309,"Make My Trip - The Fastest Way to Experience Hell. On mouthsut I want to share my experience with Make My Trip, India's leading travel portal. I planned a family vacation taking old people and children using ratings and information by Make My Trip(MMT). At the time of booking, I didnt realize in the name of vacation, MMT will make me experience HELL before my death. MMT charged the hotel fare online in advance and based on their online recomendation(recomnded hotels.) I ended up booking 3 rooms for 8 people in a hotel called ""The Corporate"" in Kolkata. Till I arrived in this hotel, everything felt like I am on earth. Once I arrived in the hotel the HELL experience started. I have heard of description of hell in books, first time experienced it. The MMT staff made me realize few things during long conversation late night and early morning: Dont belive on line portals for booking your hotels, especially if it is through MMT Dont go by review on MMT, it is for mis-information purpose to misguide you, rather take a guess and go by your luck in terms of where you will land There is nothing called customer support in MMT. It should be called customer harrsment. Even though you send emails and you recive some numbers from MMT, it doesnt mean anything. What will happen to the customer purely depends on what suits MMT. If you seek any clarification from MMT customer executive, he will not think twice to remind you - ""You booked the hotel yourseld online, so any problem you faced is your problem"". MMT cant help Dont expect any help from from hotels and espceially if the hotel is Hotel Corporate in Kolkata. You will only feel disturbed at the end and your holiday is 101% guranteed to be spoiled If you still have stamina to follow up, the hotel and MMT will take you on a joint call and they will rather inform you ""customer is nothing for them. The customer has paid the money, now it is the customers fault. So for fault, let the customer suffer. If you ask them if the suffering can be lessened, they will show you the reality, the customer is not in a vaccation but actually in HELL. And in hell, what you can experience is only suffering. Vaccation & Hotels are used on MMT site to actually meaning HELL and JAIL with SUFFERING. 7.If you tell them that India has law / police / public voice - MMT executives give you a sarcastic smile on phone and tell you TRY WHAT YOU CAN - BUT THE EXPERIENCE OF HELL CAN NOT BE CHANGED FOR THE SIN OF BOOKING HOTELS / VACCATIONS THROUGH MMT So this is my first hand experience ehile I am still in Hell. I will post more updates. The traveller in Hell requested readers in Mouth Shut to share this first hand experince from hell with other users / travel sites / NGOs who can help on consumer rights. Any help from government / private sector / genearal public to share this experience and take action agains the MMT as a whole will be highly appreciated. Awaiting help in HELL.",1
2310,"I had booked Bus ticket from Make my trip and selected SVR tours, travels Apple I bus, and boarded the bus on 22nd May 2015, 11pmalong with my aged mother from Bangalore Tin Factory pont. At 12:45pm bus had a break down at the Chickbalapur junction near Bangalore International airport. The driver and other passengers called the manager Nagaraj who informed within 45 minutes an alternative bus will come. But the alternative bus came in the morning at 8:45am and reached Hyderabad at 5:30pm. The bus authorities didnt even bother to give water or anything. Usually in all the Volvo buses you get water so nobody even bothered to carry water while travelling. And the temperature inside the bus was 30 degree celcius, Even the drop point selected was Ameerpet but the bus dropped at Mehandipatnam. While travelling itself had dropped a mail to Make My trip but didnt get any response. Please think 100 times while booking tickets from Make My trip, if you book tickets from Make my trip make sure you dont get any support and get ready for the most unpleasent travel.",1
2311,In the month of January we booked 2 tickets from kolkata to Bangalore in the date of 14th August. As usual we took only a print out and that was not the e tickets. Few days back we talked to make my trip customers service. It was jet airways. We asked for e ticket. We are surprised that they are informing that the tickets has been cancelled. We informed that we didn't get any cancellation money. We get shocked. They are unable to solve the issue. Then we decided to call jet airways service. They sincerely took all the information. They told actually flight not cancelled the flight get changed. They send us the e tickets. I will recommend make my trip please be little effective.,2
2312,"We went on a package to Uttarakhand through MMT which was also our 10th year of holidaying through your ourganization. Our experience has been less than satisfactory. Firstly, we got a smaller car than what was discussed with the sales rep. Honee Wangwani refused to pick my calls. We were completely stranded as she was our only point of contact. In fact, she had mentioned that she will be there to help us right through the trip, but she never spoke to us after the payment was made. When we finally reached out to Surjit Singh(after going through the helpline multiple times) about this change, he actually told us to adjust rather than helping us with the designated vehicle. The driver kept on informing us that he can take us to only those destinations that he has been told to do so even though we had a valid voucher with clear sight seeing details. We ended up paying Rs. 600 to the driver as he mentioned that he has to be compensated for the fuel expense for taking us out. At every destination, we had to negotiate with the driver to take us to places which were very much part of itinerary. Secondly, we had horrible experience at the hotel Den in Corbett Park. It took them 6 hours after multiple follow-ups to rectify the hot water tap. Our request for room change was also rejected. The food also was quite sub-standard. Even though we had paid extra for the Deluxe Package, our experience at the Den was very disappointing. Finally, in each of the destinations we were given one day free; here the driver just refused us to take even to the nearest shopping point or retaurant saying that the leisure day is for us to make our own arrangements, How do you expect us to make our own arrangements in a unfamiliar place. The resorts are away from the city, how can we find our own commute? If we have to make our own arrangements, why should be go through MMT? Overall, the experience was far from satisfactory right from after-sales to vehicle to driver & accomodation. My suggestion is that you plan the itinerary in such a way that all facilities are available to the guest through MMT itself. We pay money upfront expecting a good time & hassle free holiday.",1
2313,"MakeMyTrip is cheating by taking payment and then confirming booking has failed. Refund would take 3-14 days and their service centre does not answer calls and keeps you waiting for nearly an hour. And then when you complete the online complaint form, you get a message ""Oops we are facing some difficulties"". But still nobody calls you even though they have a faulty system. What happened to me is they cancelled my ticket without my willingness and they are not refunding the money also. I just want to say NEVER GO WITH MAKEMYTRIP. THEY ARE CHEATERS.",1
2314,"I had booked ticket through Makemytrip, Ticket Booking ID- NF2201444236985.Ticket Amount was 3353, Booked on 22 Apr15, afterthat I had cancelled ticket on 11th May15. As per the process cancellation charges are 2000. So they will refund me 3353-2000=1353, but they took 4250 cancellation charges and showing refund amount is -897. I called customer care 3 times but they are not responding, Please dont book your ticket through Makemytrip any time.",1
2315,We had booked a trip for 12 ladies using Make my trip. The payment was made for stay and airport transfers in the first and the last city we visited. Apparently in the final city  we were given airport transfer only for 6 and there was no transfer for the remaining 6 passengers. It was extremely inconvenient for us and we had to book 2 cabs for the passengers who were not offered transfer. The voucher mentioned that the pickup point was from the hotel while this was not actually the case. It was a 15 mins walk from the hotel to a pint where a cab picked us to the airport. We had to rent another cab to reach the pickup point as it is practically impossible and not safe for 6 ladies to walk with all our luggage for 15 mins in an unknown place at 4:15 AM. It was not a pleasant experience with this reputed organization and inspite of sending them a mail with complaint mentioned no one reverted after 4 working days. Looks like the do not care for the clients once the payments are made.,3
2316,"Makemytrip is a site which allows booking of hotel, air tickets and railway ticket.In another word it plan your trip. I every year go to Hyderabad for my mother's treatment.On my first visit to Hyderabad it was damn helpful for us. First it offered me discount on flight booking and price of air tickets were 200-300rs less then other sites.As I was completely new to Hyderabad I was not aware which hotel was near asian institute of gastroenterology which is in somajigudo. I just made a search in makemytrip with my budget of hotel and belive me I think I got the best deal and one of the best hotel.It was amurtha castle. They offered me a great discount and booking was very easy.SIte is very userfriendly.On arrival to the hotel they had my booking through makemytrip so everything went well. I loved makemytrip and would be booking through makemytrip again.",4
2317,"IF any one has an ounce of brain will surely not book on this site, Its just a waste of your money and time. I had booked my ticket from Hanoi to Mumbai via booking ID  NNXX03810974844 and I am waiting for the last 9 days for the E-Ticket and still not received the same. I am only getting a assurance every time I send email or call the helpline many times and the response every time is that the E-Ticket will be sent within the next 6 hours but after that no response. Also the call center employee will send you on a wild goose chase transferring you to the customer service and then to the marketing and finally with the assurance. Make My Trip.com seems to be a fraud company and only taking people for a ride and pathetic response. They simply do not care for the customers and only thrive on swindling peoples money by adding all kinds of additional hefty charges for booking, rescheduling and cancellation in addition to the airlines charges. I think the leading newspapers need to investigate on the mode of operations for this type of companies and how they swindle peoples money and do not take any accountability for any issue and the customer has to directly contact the airlines or Hotels for any issues. Pls only use these sites for price comparisons but book directly with the airlines as you will better service and resolution of any issues. Also will be taking this case to the consumer forum at the earliest for hardship suffered and mental harassment. https://consumeraffairs.com/travel/makemytrip.html",1
2318,"I am absolutely livid with the way my post sales has been handled. The company is seriously into a financial recovery agent and is least bothered about customer services. My visa and passports were issued after follow ups and stinkers for my vacation.However I was hounded for the payment as if I have taken a loan from Make my trip and not repaid them. After the complete payment is made, if I call the sales person, they direct to a call centre who has no information except the boarding dates and landing dates. I ask for a simple day wise itinerary for a vacation, I am told that this will be given at the destination and we clueless about what we are going to do. The sales person is based out of Bangalore and operations team is based out of Gurgaon. The Gurgaon will only respond if you talk of money to be paid else clueless. I made a mistake by choosing make my trip.suggest other customers think before going through this nightmare.",1
2319,"One of the reasons why I always ended up booking my flight tickets via make my trip was that it shows up first in the list of google search. I had made a couple of bookings using this site earlier, but never realised how bad their after sales service was because I never had to modify/cancel my bookings. And this time, whn I had to chnge my flight dates due to an emergency, I had the worst nightmare of my life! I had to spend more than 2 and half hours on call just to get the dates changed. One of the most funny and equally annoying part was that none, mind my words- ""NONE"" of the representatives I spoke to had any idea about how to help me. I had called them 4 times to get the date change done and all the 4 times they kept transferring my call from one person to another with one same statement ""allow me to transfer your call to the concerned department"" and guess what, it took me 4calls and almost 2.5hours to reach the ""CONCERNED DEPARTMENT"". There were times when my call was actually transferred to the same person again and again after he/she had already tranferred the call to another representative. I actually felt like that ""PARCEL"" in passing the parcel game! I mean seriously? The app doesnt work, the website is crap, I cannot rely on calls to seek help, how the hell does a customer approach u? Moreover, the staff was extremely clueless about the penalty charges as everyone who picked up the call gave me different rates each time. Worst online experience I have ever had, will never use this site again. And I will make sure that I stop everyone I can from using this site as well.",1
2320,"I went to Bangalore last month. I contacted Mr.X who was head of the sales officers. She was completely professional person, knew every detail which I wanted from her. During my whole conversation she was very polite and humble. I was put in touch with some other team mates of Bangalore and through out my journey they guided me very well. I received the best price during my hotel stays, domestic ticket and car rental from Make my trip team.I was provided with the invoice bill of each transaction and it was a very painless process. In my personal and proffesional option team of Make my Trip are doing a best job in their field. Looking forward to deal with Make my Trip in future to all my visits. Thanks, Make My Trip Team.",4
2321,"I had booked Bhutan Package recently and completed the trip. The trip went well, that is the positive feedback that I would like to give here. But my complaint is When I initially booked the package from Kolkata my total price was 88 K and very next day the deluxe package price for the same day departure came down making a loss of around 10K for me. MMT excutives fOllowed up previous day to book saying as seats fill prices will increase and so on. Next day, when I questioned customer care executive said, the mgmt has changed the price and they did not have any clue about it and cant pay the difference. Now I am penalised for booking early and travel with fellow travellers who have booked later than me and stayed in same hotel with lesser price. If this issue is not resolved then I will never book in MMT for the discrimination done to me. I have raised the complaint in MMT portal as well. It was escalated and currently in your queue. My booking id is NL2081471201 and complaint id is 150409-036332",2
2322,I traveled to Himachal for 8 days through make my trip.(5th may-12thmay)it was a horrible experience I had ever faced. Their service is very very poor as compared other travel companies. They promise you to give you very good hotels at the time of the booking and once they receive your payment they degrade your hotels giving an excuse that rooms are not available. Moreover if you face any problem during their trip their number is always busy and if by any chance u get connected they keep you waiting on the call for around 15-20 mins.but still the problem doesn't get solved and they start blaming the customer itself and find nice excuses to defend themselves.i have faced a lot of problems in those 8 days which I cannot type. But after experiencing this kind of a horrible trip I am damn sure that I shall never plan my trip through this company.,1
2323,"Be careful with this Service Make My Trip, V V bad in giving the service to the customer when they faced some problem in the travel trip, they will just care till the customer books the tickets. After they dont care to the customer if they face any kind of problems in travel. Especially in the amount refund case they are very worst in refunding the customer money back. They just play a game with the customer just giving one one reason everyday when you call up to the customer care. I suggest never ever go to this site for any kind of booking.",1

2327,Two months ago my parents visited Hyderabad to attend their friend's son's wedding. So I booked a hotel for them using MakeMytrip. At that time there was some discount going on(MMT30). So I got a room for 1900rs for a day. I booked it for two days. When they reached Hyderabad they found the hotel looks different the way it was looking on MakeMyTrip. On website it was looking pretty  decent but in actual it was way different from word decent. As they reached in evening they were forced to check in and they were too tried as well. The room which was given to them was very small. On website it was looking quite big. Watch room was not clean. Flush was not working. After the 2nd day my parents decided to stay for one more day. when they went to reception to increase the stay for one day they asked them to pay 4000rs. Which was double what I payed for booking. After the argument they said if u want to room for 1900rs please do online booking again. They called me and I did the booking for one more day. I don't understand why makemy trip list such hotels. They should improve their slandered so that such hotel should not exist on their website. They had tough time but whom should we complain?,3

I booked a ticket from MAA to BOM 1 from makemytrip and 1 from goibibo but due to some changes there was a need to change when I cancelled it from go ibibo I recd a refund amount of 2600 and when I cancelled the same from makemytrip they are refunding a amount of 2500 but now they are saying that they will refund only 415 INR. How can there be a huge change in the cancellation amount when booked and cancelled at the same time. this is a very bad experience they are not refunding the amount which they said they will and after cancellation they are changing the refund amount. very bad experience will surely not use make mytrip again goibibo is much better than makemytrip/,1

2332,I had been booking my tickets through Makemytrip since long but had a real bad experience when I got my First overseas ticket booked on it. Unfortunately I had to cancel my tickets due to medical reasons on the 10/3/15 and still awaiting the refund.I have been calling them up almost thrice a week and they tell me they would revert back within 72 hours or 48 hours which they never till date. Today again I called up and they told me that the delay was from the Emirates end and not them.I called up Emirates but they have not received any refund request till date.God knows whose fooling whom.I have lost 1 lac in tickects and visa due to my ill health and these guys are not concerned and not even reverting back to my mails. WORST EXPERIENCE as almost 2 months have passed and no clue of refund(only tax part as ticket was non-refundable).,1
2333,"Yesterday I booked one ticket for my wife for the date of 7th jun 2015 from Guwahati to delhi. I usually use goibibo.com site to book air tickets. Yesterday makemytrip.com site had low cost ticket for the date of 7th jun 2015 as compared to other site, so I preferred to go for booking with makemytrip only. At the time of booking I filled all correct details with full name But the e ticket which I received is containing Last name only including Mss When I called up to customer care they told me that they need to investigate and advised me to call directly to airline to change name. As they advised me I have called to airasia customer care, according to the airasia customer care the name change is not possible so they advised me to cancel the ticket and book a new ticket. Again I called up to make mytrip and updated all these conversation. After long discussion with Ms Kajal(from CC team) I have disconnected the call as she was repeating the same statement again and again and she was also not ready to transfer call to her supervisor/mAnasultanger. Today I received the reply they are stating that their technical team has checked and found the logs that I have entered ms in first name. I am bit surprised as I have reviewed the from around three times and also I had corrected the first initial of first name with capital later. Now according to the rule they have charged me RS1900 for cancelation. According to the email they will not return me full money. if this way makemytrip is trying to fool customer and  hide their fault thn this organization will not have single customer to book ticket from their portal. My recommendation is not to book ticket from makemytrip. the site may smorpheushumanw you lowest airfare morpheushumanwever you will get fooled by them.

2340,My experience with the biggest online hotel booking service makemytrip.com has been very good and I'm very happy with the service. I knew of makemytrip from the ads and me and my family were planning for a vacation in Shimla in march 2012. There was some discount season going on makemytrip and we decided to use the discount to save ourselves some money. We logged on the website and it was a pleasant experience. The website was fast and very easy to use. We checked out hotels in shimla. My husband found one in our budget with good amenities. We booked it for 3 days and 4 nights. We saved around 3000rs on makemytrip.com The trip was very good and hotel was excellent and good service. I would recommend makemytrip.com,5
2341,*First incident This is the review regarding the air ticket offers displayed in Make my trip. I have done air ticket through make my trip with Rs. 400/- cash back in the month of January and the travel completed in the same month. After 4 months also I have not received any cash back from make my trip or bank side. I consulted with bank but they asked me to contact make my trip. I have done escalation many times but there will be no solution from make my trip. PLEASE DO NOT DO ANY TRANSACTION THROUGH MAKE MY TRIP AS THEY WILL NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY. My second incident with Make my trip is that I have booked one air ticket but the timing of the flight was changed and not informed to me. At the last moment of air travel I just inquired the status of the flight then that time I came to know that the flight schedule has been changed. There will be no information from neither air line nor make my trip. If we done the booking through air line they will definitely inform us. Due to urgency I have cancelled the flight and booked new ticket through another air line with higher rate. I have requested make my trip to waive off the cancellation fee but they have informed that they will not take any responsibility. MY QUESTION IS: IF MAKE MY TRIP IS NOT TAKING ANY RESPONSIBILITY WHEY WE BOOK THROUGH MAKE MY TRIP INSTEAD OF AIR LINE DIRECTLY. Please beware of make my trip.com,1
2342,Makemytrip is a reliable service provider. I've booked my flight tickets  using Makemytrip as well as cleartrip. I couldn't compare either if them as I've had good experience with both of them. Makemytrip is a good website and its loading time is good. Obviously sites those are meant for the customers need to have good loading time and when it comes to booking some thing then that site has to be top notch when it comes to loading time or else people will prefer competitor site. The site has a good user interface. The look and feel is awesome and you can find many features here. You can book hotels as well as your mode of transport from this site. Meaning everything related to a outing can be planned here. The depth of information is good enough. The only drawback I feel about Makemytrip is the extra charges that they take from the customers. Maybe they can lower that down or even cut it to nil. At times it even helps as a guide. If your planning a outing and need to know rough figure then Makemytrip can act as a guide. At times you get good discounts as well on holiday packages. It's USP is that its easy to use website. I would recommend Makemytrip to everyone. A good place to plan your outing.,4

Sometimes, we can get very good deals too and the prices are best on this site. The loading time of this website is very less and very much user friendly. It is simple and easy to use. Provides some good offers and I had a wonderful experience with makemytrip.com so far. Sometimes, you can get good offers on holiday packages too and they provide the same quality whatever you expects from them.",4
2344,I have seen a lot of ad on facebook and tried it and found it very useful. The website offers a complete holiday and travel solutions along with exciting discount offers. It offers a complete list of available flight and one can select according to the time or cheapest fair. There are huge no of hotels list available online which can be booked at the convenience of my home. The hotels are generally as per the descriptions and are available at a very economical rate. I have a good experience with the online hotel booked for Andaman. My experience was very good with the website as they refunded my full flight fair of Jammu last year as I cancelled the tickets on account of flood in Jammu. The volvo bus can be booked online for Delhi to nearby cities like Jaipur and Chandigarh along with different time slot options. Each time we book through makemytrip.com we get points which can be used during next booking. The user interface is very good and it is very easy to navigate.,5
2345,Tried makemytrip a lot of time - the rates are always higher than the other websites and the fare calender always gives you a misguiding picture. The fare calender always shows a lower freight but when you actually see that date the fare is not available. Many a times it has also happened that when we select a particular flight the fare changes at the time of payment. I don't at all recommend makemytrip.com,1
2346,"Once I booked a flight ticket from Bhubaneswar to Delhi through Makemytrip to save my time but I found I get good comparison price, and after 3 days I got some promotional mail from them, which was include of payback points, discounts on flight booking and Hotel booking. Then I search for an economy hotel at Delhi, I got an unbelievable price offer, then I book immediately, and in this continuous booking process had got good payback points which lead me to a free flight to Delhi without paying a single money. This is one of the best Online hotel accommodation provider.",5

HDFC bank told me on 07 April 2015 & again on 16 April 2015 that this ref number does not mean anything to them. •   On 16 April 2015 #Makemytrip told me that full refund has NOT been transferred to my bank so far, & it is pending in Accounts dept of #Makemytrip itself., and the ref no given to me was just a ref of my request! Thus it is seen that #Makemytrip is only misleadingme & is sitting on my money! I am a retired senior cmajeechazen. Service providers like Makemytrip are for making life easier, especially for senior cmajeechazens. Instead, I am being harassed. I request Spicejet & Makemytrip to make full refund to me, and sort out their internal transactions separately. Dinesh Kumar Rohatgi, . Mob 09452901900. Email: dineshkrohatgi@gmail.com",1
2348,"I tried booking bus ticket from makemytrip.com thinking of it as a reliable company. Here is my horrible experience booking bus ticket with makemytrip. Booked a bus ticket from hyderabad to Nagpur, payment method selected was net banking. Payment was successful but no ticket delivered. Called Customer care after 15 minutes to check on what is happening. Customer care acknowledged the booking and told me to wait 20 minutes and the ticket would be delivered. Damn waited 12 hours and no ticket or any communication yet. Called the so called customer service again, provided all the information.Now they provided new reasons for not delivering the tickets 1) They are not able to get the booking in the selected bus. If you are not able to get the booking why the bus is available for booking? 2) 2nd reason there was some payment gateway error from makemytrip side.So they are processing a refund. They informed me because I called no email or phone communication. So if you don't call you won't know whats happening. The refund would take 3 days to process, Seriously. The Customer Service Representative suggested me to book another ticket. When I asked since you have my money already why don't you process the same order for me. The answer is company policy, funny, if the money is paid why can't they book the order. I asked what is the guarantee that there won't be any more technical failures if I book ticket again. No answer . Technical Failure is an inconvenience to the customer and on top of that you have indian government like policies which asks customer to commit more money for the same transaction. How idiotic. Please open a travel agency with manual processing, u  do not deserve a place on internet.",1
2349,"Today I'll be sharing my experience and review on the India's  online trip and hotel booking service makemytrip.com It was my mom and dads 25th anniversary and wanted to gift them a holiday for just the two of them. So I didn't want the conventional option of looking for an agent and making the arrangements. So I looked up trips on makemytrip as it popped first in my mind when I was thinking of online booking. So I booked a hotel room in manali for my parents for 3 days and 4 nights from makemytrip. The experience was good as it was easy to find the hotels in manali in my budget. I checked up the images on makemytrip and other sites as well. I booked them and made travel arrangements for them. When they came back from the trip they told me the experience was great and the hotel was very good with cleanliness, staff and service. I was pleased to see my parents happy. So I would recommend makemytrip for online hotel booking in India and rate it 5.",5

Inspite of refunding my money they  are asking about stamped document. I talked with AIR INDIA customer care they said that full amount is to be refunded but due to the carelessness of make my trip I am loosing my money. Its not about money its all about service. BOOKING ID  was NF2203648228588 from RAIPUR to DELHI & DELHI to RAIPUR for the date 10th march 2015 & 15th march 2015. I cancelled one side ticket because I have to take International flight from Delhi to China on the same date and the duration between both the flights is only 1 hour. As I have to clear immigration and all check-ins a Delhi Airport I don't have that much time because its a lengthy process and the flights are also not connecting flights therefore I cancelled one side ticket and made new ticket which is connecting to my next international flights. Hence MAKE MY TRIP must have to refund my money for one side ticket cancelled but they are not paying to it. ITS TOTALLY IRRITABLE AND FRUSTATED SERVICE FROM THEM.",2
2351,"Never ever book through makemytrip.com Its the most useless portal ever, I was making a booking for Ethiopian airlines through the portal, and they charged my card without any id or booking generated. When I called the customer care it took me 3 hours of explaining my problem to 3 different people and then I was told that they would book my tickets and guess what their backend system Amadeus didn't even have Ethiopian airlines listed. They said they will treat my case as priority and initiate a refund which I should get back in 72 hours. I have a mail stating the same.This was on 10th April. and the customer care kept telling me please trust us we will get the refund sorted on priority. On 13th April I get a call from makemytrip saying you were trying to book a ticket and your transaction failed, so should we book tickets for you or you want a refund. Such is theri customer service and the what they say on phone and write on mails is all a BIG FAT LIE. when I said I was told the refund got initiated on friday itself, the customer care representative quickly disconnected the call. No refund till 14th April, when I call the customer care I am again put on an endless loop of  holds and call transfers which atrocious reasons being given for the transfer not being processed till now - reasons being its pending with the accounts department, one even said its 3 days plus'n' number of days of bank transfer time, another said let me generate a reference ID for you- Like HELL how many reference ID""s will you generate; I already had one, and yet another one another said its bank holiday so it should be processed by 15th april. And I have a mail stating the same as well. Today is 16th April and still no refund, I posted complaints on social media and now I am barely getting a response on that as well. when I ask them to send me proof of the transfer initiation they just refuse and vanish. Yesterday on facebook I was told my refund will be initiated EOD, like HELLO I was told it got initiated on friday. They are such liars, with a superbly incompetent customer care. It should not even be called customer care as there is no care but an endless loop of putting on hold and no resolution or even an update. As I write this I am still fighting for a refund and trying to get a response from them. NAd mind you this is no small amount that they are sitting on. And as I see there are a number of more people fighting for refunds with makemytrip. They are such a sham, Please NEVER EVER BOOK THROUGH MAKEMYTRIP UNLESS YOU WANT TO ENCOURAGE SUCH CROOKS TO BE IN BUSINESS.",1
2352,"Never risk your hard-earned money patronizing this company because if your flight is cancelled, they will cheat you out of your refund. These people at MMT Gurgaon office just lie through their teeth and defraud customers of money. Their top boss in Gurgaon clearly embezzle customer funds and use it to line their own pockets. There is a pattern of chronic corruption going on and customer service reps have been trained to keep stalling customers who inquire about status of their refund. The rot goes straight to the top. An aunty had recently lost her husband and she asked me to arrange her flight from Kochi to Chennai in December 2014. I booked a flight via MMT. Airline informed that the flight had been cancelled a few days prior to departure. I called MMT about refunding the money and was told I would need to confirm refund processing with airline. Despite long waits on airline phone service, I was able to confirm the refund processing from their end and phoned MMT again in Dec, was told aunty's refund would be sent in two weeks. Got back home in Jan and called re: status of refund and met with very rude representative named Puneet on the phone who said refund had already been processed and he was not sure what to say to me. Then began saga of communicating with MMT via email. They ask for credit card statements which I forward to them and then they lie about how the refund will be processed, has been processed, they don't know why it is not showing up on my statement, they need to check with accountant, they need more time and more such nonsense tactics. Have now gone through two reps(one Ruchi Panchal and another Arpit Christian). First Ms. Panchal claimed refund had not been sent from airline and tried to shake me off that way. When I told them I would register an official complaint with police, Ms. Panchal immediately promised that refund had been processed on Feb 15th and would be deposited in my statement within 20 days. All lies. Now Mr. Christian asks for statements which I have forwarded to him. Then each time I follow up he requests more time and sits on his hands. He asked for time till March 20th 5 pm and provided no response by Mar 25th so I followed up. Then Mr. Christian asked for time till April 9th 5 pm and as of April 14th there has been no response from MMT.",1

2359,"(I am not paid by anyone to write this review on Mouthshut.) Please abstain from booking flights, hotels or any kind of holiday service from MMT.com. They are the worst travel company you would come across - an unprecedented disaster as far as holidays are concerned. Here's how they will go about it- For some sectors they will have an unbelievable price - not in offer from any other travel website. This would be break journey. There would be catch to this break journey - it would be an impossible one - for instance a 30 minute stopover between flights which would be logistically impossible to plan and control. One of there executives will call you and enlighten yu and provide you with suitable option to overcome the impossibility of step 2. This by itself will inflate the travel bill by 25%.(so much for great prices) Walk out at this juncture please. If you choose to stay beyond this, MMT has a great ability to become deaf, unfeeling and inhospitable to you after the receive their payments. The very executives who would call you thrice a day for booking will suddenly be very busy. Forget mail responses and be ready to listen to music over the toll free number for the longest times. All this after you have paid your monies. You can choose to reach out to everyone including their CEO - but then all of them would be equally deaf. The higher you go - the more acute is the deafness:) Please people - stay away from the MMT scams. I have had extremely bad experiences twice. I have had better experiences with others(dont want to name the alternatives) Ron",1

Since make my trip has a long process(more than a week) to trace a call and get me refund I had to cancel the ticket and reissue a new at a higher price and pay penalty for cancelling the previous ticket. I have two emails from make my trip which confirm that if make my trip is at fault they will pay me back the penalty charges and other one confirming that it is their fault.

I got a response that a special team will be put up and will revert in 72 hours. Now after one week, I am told a'special team' will be set up for a simple call trace and will revert in more 72 hours. I am surprised at this, for giving me a refund of ticket which I had to cancel because of their executive's mistake they need to put up a special team and more 72 hours to trace this. It is really disappointing to know how make my trip can serve its customer so poorly. Being in travel industry make my trip FAILS to understand how crucial time is.

2365,"I am surprised nobody writes about the demerits of a quick booking over Makemytrip. So here goes. There is no such thing like a refundable ticket. Yes even if it says the ticket can be cancelled .Beware. The Cancellation costs are almost 50% of the ticket price. Yes even if you decide 1 minute after you booked that you want to change the time of your flight you have to pay some 1500 Rs. per ticket to Makemytrip. If you call their custormer service they will tell you the airline is charging them, if you call the airline they say call Makemytrip for the issue. But I think they [Makemytrip.com] are lying about it. How do I know?. Because if you directly book with an airline there are no cancellation charges for changing your flight time/schedule. Basically I think these are the fees they charge the airline for booking and are not paying it back to the customers, not even one second after booking. Moral of the story is don't book airline tickets on this website unless you are sure you wont change anything. It is too expensive to do that. Happened to me two times. The first time itself I decided in future to only use them as a search engine. But after the second time I made a mistake as I was quick in making the payment I decided not to ever book flights on their website again. In fact re-scheduling cost is also lower if you re-schedule directly with the airline concerned. Sad but true.",3

The PNR allotted by Make my trip had miraculously vanished from the e-ticket. I got a frantic call from my wife and I immediately got in touch with the call centre. During my first interaction I was told that Indigo had cancelled the ticket. I checked with the Indigo staff at the airport and found the accusation against Indigo to be false. I again called up Make my trip call centre and was told that due to heavy booking my e-ticket was cancelled. My wife had no option but to buy fresh tickets at the airline counter at the airport for Rs 10420 on the so called heavily booked flight ie 6E-135.Make my trip refunded an amount of Rs 9888 without any apology or explanation.

2376,"Had employed MMT services for a golden quadrilateral trip in November 2014. An advisor( with initials S Routh) was assigned to me who was very poor in handling the issue. Couldn't give me proper bills and invoices in time and made me wait till she clarified with her superiors. The car given broke down in middle of the road between delhi and Agra. The driver keep pleading that he would lose his job if we report it to them. Finally old aged parents started sympathizing with the driver and I had to not report the poor vehicle provided to us. Invoice was given over the mail which would never be accepted by any govt institutions for reimbursement. Finally had to take the matter up with the regional Head and with much delays got the requisitioned invoice. Never ever get to go with MMT, or avail their services over the phone. Please visit the nearest MMT agency and get everything clarified. Else these people will take you for a ride. Personally not recommended at all!",1
2377,"I have booked a ticket for Indigo using make my trip in Dec'14 and refund still not done from MakeMyTrip in 3 months time in end of March. After logging cancellation with Indigo office still make my trip does not even initiate Multiple follow up but no clear respond and refund still missing. While the whole web site as well as customer service will find system not working etc to log a complaint. It looks like I am not the only victim, whole process of refund is not friendly.",1
2378,"Poor customer satisfaction: This is really not acceptable from you guys that I have booked 5 domestic tickets from Makemytrip US website as there was a deal going on on Saturday and at that time I was charged the whole amount of ticket from my credit card but after that all tickets were cancelled by your backend department without informing to the customer which is really ridiculous. If we have paid the money for our tickets then it means we should be informed about any change in my tickets but it didn't happened at all and my travel plan has been cancelled by you. If there was any technical issue from your side then it is not our fault and I will not suffer this inconvenience at any cost, I will raise this concern to higher authorities if I will not get the refund as well as compensation for this within this week because my whole travel plan has been disturbed due to your fault and my money has also been charged with surcharge fees as well, So I am waiting for your response as soon as possible at any cost. Booking id: UN230287465935, UN230287465845, UN230287465803, UN230287465777, UN230287465659 Note: This is my advice to you that please check with your backend people who are creating a problem for the customers unnecessarily.

2379,"Searching for Makemytrip.com Complaints, I wondered if MS.com has any, SURPRISE OF SURPRISES! None, no Bad Reviews, all Goody, Good ones, Makemytrip is providing Very Good Service to Happy CustomersI wonder Why this Step-Motherly Treatment with me? Also, hear this out - For those who haven't heard of the MakeMytrip.com Slogan ""We Provide Unforgettable Memories"", know that now, cause I will Narrate myOwn First Hand Experiencewhich is soIronical about the Much Acclaimed and Prize Winner company which now, is Really Living up to its Slogan. Want to know how? Read my Sad and Bitter Experience below: On 9th December, 2014 I had made a booking whose ID is - MakeMyTrip Booking ID - IN1412B6S065455 within the stipulated time I cancelled this Flight and its Reference Number is - IN1412R6S110377 The ticket was cancelled and I received an email from MakeMyTrip that the refund will be initiated within 5 Working Days on 15th December 2014. I had also contacted the customer care regarding this and I was assured that I will get the refund in 5 Working days. Due to a Certain Emergency I could not keep a track of the Refund, however later on I found out that the amount had not been refunded. I sent them emails regarding this but they replied back giving excuses for few more days. Then I called the below mentioned numbers on several occasions 124 462 8747, 124 289 8747, 124 462 8765, 124 462 8765 This is really Frustrating and Irritating that a Reputed company like Makemytrip indulges in such delays, I tried contacting them most of which were not answered, some get disconnected midway and some keep asking Extension Number, where is the extension number, I couldn't find it in their website, the Automated voice doesn't provide the option for speaking to Cust. Care, how is one to contact the concerned then? Then on 19th March when I was contacting the Cust. Care, I opted for new International Booking which was Miraculously Attended to and I was surprised and they again gave a False Reassurance that I will get the Refund in 72 Hours, however that didn't happen. I was supposed to be refunded in Dec 2014 and now it is end of March 2015, I am thinking of a Serious Action against them and nowI want no less than full amount refunded without any penalties plus Three Months Interest Added to it. Update I have received a majority of the Refund but the Pending Amount doesn't seem to be ""In Sight"", just byPosting a Circular Stickersaying""Response Received"" doesn't make it ""Response Resolved"",just aGimmickry. Update15th April 2015  (In Response to MakeMyTrip.com's Corporate Response which says ""MakeMyTrip Care Cares"" Summary of my Harassment at the Hands of MakeMytrip.com Firstly, I was assured of Refund in 4 days,irrespective of the penalties that were laid. I agreed telephonically to the Penalty.But unfortunately the Refund didn’t happen for almost 4 Months Secondly, your Online System of Complaint is Totally Useless, it is a Big Joke. You keep logging again and again.and then you get theMost False Assurance that your issue will be resolved in 48 Hrs or 72 Hrs. Thirdly,Your System of Escalation is once again, a Method to keep the Clients Busy in Anticipation that their Complaint will be now taken seriously, it appears to be Pre-Planned Strategy where the Complain is not handled directly and even if the so called “Escalation Process” is just an Eye Wash, perhaps because you “You want to buy some time” Fourthly, your Customer Care System is no less, in fact it takes your “For Granted”, You keep Dialling the numbers one after the another, only to get your Call Disconnected afterthe Automated Voice tells you to “Dial the Extension Number”(where is this number mentioned in your website, not in sight when I searched for it back then)when you select the Cancelling of Flight Option.There is no option of Refund and the only way you can get to talk with an Online Representative if you have to Book a Flight or know about a Holiday Package. Fifthly, even if you get to address your issue with a Customer Care Personnel,your call is passed on to Another Executive.And this Executive would then keep you on hold only to be disconnected from the Call or he would give you a False Assurance that your Complaint is being Processed. Sixthly,after getting so many Consecutive False Assurances, one looses faith in Online Ticketing System, yours being a Glaring Example. Seventhly, you sendFalse SMS’s of Partial Refund wherein the Refund has not even been initiated, so why are you sending the SMS, when the money has not been transferred.This and others only show you as Hard Core Liars. Eighthly,“If the Airline didn’t refund you in time, is that my Fault”, “Did I delayed in paying you for Booking the Tickets and brought up any Technical Issues?”. “You people don’t have Funds of your own?  That shows how seriously you take your Clients. Ninthly, when you raise your voice in social media,one of your Executive calls up and says“Do you have a Written Proof of the Refund Amount”, so now I should keep proof of each and every Calls that have been made, MY, MY!” Is this what I deserve? Tenthly,after going through Consistent Harassments from your Side, don’t I deserve the Full Refund Amount or you will still show me the Terms and Conditions and again apologise that though you can break your Protocols when it comes to Clients Money but not the other way around?",1
2380,"This company has absolutely awful service. They may offer cheap rates, they may offer cheap packages. All that is great as long as it is fine. The moment you have a problem, they do not bother to help you resolve it. They simply do not care. After all, why would they care - they have already swallowed your money! Example 1: Try getting on their'call centre' to clarify anything. If you can get through in your first attempt, you should consider yourself to have won more than any Olympic Gold medalist has won. Example 2: When a connecting flight is re-routed, I agree that is the airline's fault. MMT however knows that the connection is important. They do nothing to ensure that the first flight is at a suitable time for you to catch your connecting flight. Example 3: When a flight is cancelled for reasons of the airline's choice, they do not refund the money. Not even when the airline has approved the refund, and returned the money to MMT. They still keep it instead of returning it to the customer. After all, a lot of people do not have the patience to wait in their exasperatingly long'customer service' queue at the call centre. And if customers do have the patience and the tenacity to follow up - its ok - they still have extra working capital for a few days longer! I can go on. Its simply appalling that they just do not care about service. Why bother? The market size is huge, and the money(atleast once) is in their pocket!",1
2381,I have booked 8 tickets for my travel within India . my card was charged and I have got confirmed e tickets for the same. after 24 hours I got a call from makemytrip saying that my booking is cancelled and they gave me reasons that money is not charged. Though my money is already charged for the same . after booking tickets I have booked hotels also . the guy who called from makemytrip was not at all ready to listen to me and continuously kept on saying the booking is cancelled . I told him that I have seat numbers and I have verified my booking with go airways also but he was not at all ready listen to me. I dont know what kind of service and brand name they advertise all around the globe . this is the pathetic service I have ever seen . after talking to that guy I called go airways again and confirmed with them and they said my booking is confirmed . these guys are harnessing people by calling them and asking them to pay more money . this is not a travel website but a recovery agency which after booking call people and force them to pay more money or haress them that they will cancel the booking . I am not going to take this lightly but will take it to consumer court and will not let my money waste like this . I have paid good 35000 inr for tickets and 46000 for hotel bookings .,1
2382,"MakeMyTrip has a pathetic customer care and complaint management system. For a simple issue of partial cancellation(Had 3 passengers on original flight, and wanted to modify the date for 1 of those), MakeMyTrip is not responding at all, despite me following up and escalating the issue for the past 9 days. Here's what happened: I call up MMT, tell them I need to modify 1 of 3 passengers on the same flight.After being redirected to multiple customer care reps and being put on hold for long, I am told MMT can't do this and I must contact JetAirways. I call JetAirways - the person says he'll separate the PNR of the 1 person, after which MMT would be able to modify the booking of that person. I'm asked to contact MMT with the new PNR he gave me. On MMT's online portal, I now only see 2 passengers. The 3rd passenger with the new PNR is no longer visible under bookings to modify online. I call MMT, describe whole issue and tell them the new PNR. He cannot see the 3rd passenger as well and doesn't know what to do. I'm redirected to someone else. Again describe whole issue. Again redirected now to MMT's supposed ""JetAirways Expert"". The MMT Expert tells me their servers are down, call after 2 hours! This, after 1 whole hour on the phone. So I call after 3 hours. ""Our servers are still down, please call after 4-5 hours""(expecting me to be up all night). Fed up of phone representatives, I tried my luck with Service Requests online on MMT's website(the same phone query listed under Complaints). I escalated it to Level 1(no response). Escalated 2 days later to Level 2(no response). Escalated to Level 3(no response). Final escalation, called ""Write To Management"", done 9 days later - still nothing.The entire escalation system seems like a farce(see attached images). If someone from MMT would care to read, the service request ID is ""150309-073127"".",1
2383,"So a lesson learnt in Jan 2014, when I had booked a trip from make my trip . My recent trip to mauritius forced me to write this all over again. This time I had booked the tour package from yatra.com. and with no regrets, I want to inform the buyers to once, plz  tryYatra.com. Unlike the disgusting plan I had taken frommake my tripearlier, Yatra.com helped with the minutest details and when I landed Mauritius their team with the proper name list and pluck cards were standing right out of the airport. Last time, Where make my trip team never knew what package they had given me and I wasted my energy in fighting there and coordinating and from dubai kept calling their team in delhi etc etc, this time Yatra.com helped me with the complete detailed itinery with time and tour visit along with the name of the guide. So thanks toyatra.comI wasted my energy only in clicking pictures and travelling. I am so glad and satisfied with yatra.com. The services, the coordination, the package whatever yatra.com had given, was absolutely perfect. Make my trip plzzzzz go take few classes on client servicing and how to make a tour package from yatra.com. make my trip ppl itself badly needs to go on a break or a holiday.Make my trip team you can take packages from yatra.com. PS: I AM A CUSTOMER AND NOT REPRESENTING ANY COMPANY'S PR HERE! SO ANYONE HAVING A DOUBT CAN CHECK MY PROFILE ETC. make my trip you can keep that money as a token! Gunjan Prasad",1
2384,"THE CASE: • I Booked Spicejet flights SG228 & SG227 from Bangalore to Pune and back for journey on 28-Dec 2014 & 31 Dec 2014 respectively through #MakeMyTrip.(Booking ID NF 2203045661146) by paying about Rs 6200/=. • Received SMSes on 20 Dec 2014 from #MakeMyTrip intimating me about cancellation of both the flights by the airline(MMT admits they sent these SMSes). • Requested #Makemytrip on 23 Dec 2014 to make me full refund. MMT showed recently a refund of only Rs 314/=, on account of “No Show”, as intimated to them by Spicejet. I am asking #Makemytrip how there can be a case of No Show for a cancelled flight. They only say “No Show” was informed to them by Spicejet. • I spoke to Spicejet today on 18 Dec 2014-they said that these flights were not cancelled, and it was a case of No Show. I HAVE MADE ENDLESS CALLS TO #MAKEMYTRIP CALL CENTRES JUST TO GET ONE MORE REFERENCE ID.AFTER MORE THAN 20 calls of not less than 30 minutes they send this dumb email(Please see the image attached).The subject states “ REFUND” and mail talks nothing about it. I will shortly put a record of all calls too. Travel portals like #MakeMyTrip are to make life easier for old retired people and not make them go through this harassment. I now advise all people of my age to please book via local travel agent. Their service is much much better! AFTER KEEPING THE MONEY FOR MORE THAN 5 MONTHS, #MAKEMYTRIP STILL HAVE NO ANSWER AS TO WHEN WILL IT BE RELEASED? Shame on the service.",1
2385,"While returning from back on Holi from my home town I was unable to get a rail reservation  so I booked a bus ticket for my self and for my cousin on Make My Trip from Kanpur to Delhi with booking ID No NU27011960036502 for date 08 Mar 2015. On the ticket only boarding time, place and name of operator was given but no bus number was mentioned.  Hence, 4 hours before the boarding time tried to call the operator to confirm the bus No or the drivers mob no so that I could locate the bus. Three Nos were provided in the ticked but only one of them responded after several attempts and gave be another no which was already not responding.  After that I called Make MY trip customer care the explained the problem, the executive told me I will receive a call within half an hour and they will provide me details.  I kept calling here and there but all in vain I din't received any call and neither was able to find my bus. Ultimately I missed my bus and both of us travelled by some other mode.  This is a type of fraud with the customers as without giving you Bus No how could you locate a bus on a highway where hundreds of vehicles passing every minute.",1
2386,"By any chance your flight is cancelled or you cancel your tickets, forget the money you've paid coz make my trip will never refund the money. they are third class travel agents. If you call their customer care, to wait for 1hr to talk them. if you ask the refund you will get response ""we will arrange a call back within 24 - 48 hrs"" ""Please wait for 4-5 working days you well get your money""(I waited for four months still haven't received my money. if you drop a mail never expect a response, even if they respond you there wont be any solution to the problem . Don't be fooled by their offers, prefer yatra or expedia they are much better. I feel this company does not have enough cash flow to run, they are depending on customer's money by not refunding the amounts. Make my trip is like a fraudster travel agent.",1
2387,"I had to change the itinerary of an international flight booked through MMT. Special conditions attached on the ticket by MMT does not allow change via online. To reach them via the call center took me finally 20 hours on the 4th call. They keep routing you from one'sepcialist' to another and no one seems to know what they are doing. Most of the time the call will be on voice recording saying'all our specialist are busy', 'high call volume' etc. finally when you get a person to talk, they will put you on hold saying 1 minute but will take 5 minutes to come back. Then they will say that your call will have to be put to another department. All of a sudden after spending 30 minutes like this you will realise the call has been disconnected! When I complained via their online system, they closed the complaint saying everything can be done online and a footnote if not possible it is the problem of the airline. So that means they do not want anyone to call back on the phone. Finally they charged me Rs 500+ 12% for the service(!) they provided This is a shame - avoid this portal completely.",1
2388,Although I had couple of bookings with makemytrip before the current one where makemytrip surpassed all the -ve expectations which you may have regarding the worst service. I had to cancel my flight since my international flight got delayed and its more than two months since I cancelled the flight but I yet to get the refund. Their customer care numbers are kind of funny because what ever option you select they provide you an automated response and you have to really try all the options till you get an agent. Even after reaching the agent they give you all the assurances on the phone but after that again nothing happens. Till your booking goes usual way i.e. you book it and travel its ok but when you need to make changes like I was suppose to you are going to have an exp of lifetime. try others before you go for this one. Being from outside India is a  pain for me. More than locals who probably have the option of walking in to one of their office but ask yourself if this is what you want to face.,1
2389,My experience with the make my trip is very bad. I have booked ticket from Bangalore to vizag and cancelled it later. I am trying to reach them for refund from many days. I could not get their attention once. every time it is saying call volume is high and wait for more time. it is 4th time I have called and waited for more than 5-10 min the but did not the chance to speak,1

2393,"Hi MMT, I am not here to complain because of a issue in the booking. I am here to complaining about you guys not even responding for a possible booking. Why do you guys claim the sun and moon to customers when you cant even show the basic earth to them I am travelling to sri lanka next month with a fixed date and simple itinerary . The same was given to your ""tour specialist"" on your ivr no. 3 times since last wed. Meaning I called 3 times last week and each of the 3 agents had said, ""sorry maam"", your booking has not yet been worked upon so I will revert back to you. I have wasted almost 3 hours giving the same itinerary to your agents and not a single email/ call back. each time someone else picked up the phone and said that she will revert by eod. But I forgot, since you guys work for international packages, u guys never have a eod.   . or maybe you guys are sooo busy travelling yourself that why respond to customers for packages. after all we are MMT. Guys, just a feedback get a reality check. you guys are not omnipresent. there are multiple travel agents and gud ones who gladly respond to packages.=**i am not writing this issue as I am desperate to book a package from you guys. I felt that maybe bigger brands are better in their customer care service and dedication to work but you guys proved me wrong. Bigger brands have better UI on site and its more glossy, but down bottom, you guys feel that now that we are big, why should we work. anyways, thanks for proving  me wrong. I have got quotes from multiple agents and will close by package for next month soon. Now you would be thinking on why am I wasting my time on mouthshut to write such a long review. Reason is, when I can waste my time trying to get my package from you and you guys throw attitude, I feel the world should know about your seriousness on work. Why should someone else too waste his/ her time and get this funny feeling that I am getting. after all time is precious. The irony of situation is that a customer was after you guys to book a package but you guys were too busy to attend to him. Maybe you can refund my mobile bill for the 3 calls I did and wasted by time and money. cheers to your non existing tour specialist and hopeless behaviour:) . Just stick to the online world( hotel / flights)  and shut shop for the offline booking. you guys are too busy for the offline travel agency.**=",1

I've received the Electronic ticket successfully within 20 minutes after making the payment by my credit card. Then, at midnight I checked my email and found a new message from one of the company's representatives called: Kulbir Singh. asking me to provide a photocopy of the credit card(backside and front side) and a photo ID of me. I replied and sent him the front side and informed him that the next day I'll send the backside and my photo id because I don't have them right now. The second day I finished my work and went to my office and sent the rest documents and asked him if everything is ok. but he didn't reply, I checked the booking with AirFrance, and they informed me that the booking has been cancelled completely(without any notification)! I sent Kulbir Singh  an email asking him what's wrong! but he didn't answer, after 3 days he simply replied: ""your booking has been cancelled and a full refund of paid amount is in your account"" .(USD 1477.00). I checked with my Bank, but they informed me several times that no refund exists in my account! I waited until 1st of March to find a new email in my inbox from other representative called: Ruchi Panchal.(I was sending emails frequently all that period with no replies). Ruchi Panchal stated that he/she wants to track the refund transaction so I have to provide them the following information: Booking ID    Date of Booking    E-Mail ID    Contact Number   Amount Charged    Contact Number(Provided at the time of Booking) I've sent all the requested information quickly and accurately. and he/ she disappeared until this moment! I've sent many reminders but they used their classic method(ignore the customer)! I want my refund immediately! they delayed it in addition of the damage they caused to me when booking another ticket with a higher price! I want the money! or I will file a case against this company! All their methods are not convincing! I feel there's something wrong! How they could cancel a ticket without notification! for any reason! How could they mess with people's money! and travel plans! I want my money Back ASAP.

2399,"Let me jot down all the problems that due to MMT I faced. First of all I booked my honeymoon package with Sapna Dhake & problem started from there & till date problems are continued.Sapna never provided desired response. Hence I asked to change executive & then Ritesh took over charge. Ritesh was more worse then Sapna. For a single query I used to drop him a mail 3-4 times to get answer. But still this was not enough. The day I landed in Phuket(it was very first day of our arrival), that I got itenary from cab driver & in that our sight seeing that MMT commited was not there. On very first day I was taking follow ups with Ritesh via whatsapp. I was not at all enjoying my honeymoon. We were there at airport for approximate 8 hours while coming from Bangkok to Phuket. There are many things that I already ignored & I am not jotting down. Because even I don't have strength to list so many things. Booking ID for Party was IN1502B8S045690 Honeymoon package booking ID is IN1409B3S049518 After coming back to India I talked with Ritesh, Ranjeeta Khatri, Amit, Sandeep, Sneha & other n number of persons. There was not even a single person who can handle this matter. There were tons of apologies from MMT team. As a sort of compensation I was provided voucher of 5k. MMT repeated playing wid my feelings again & again. I planned to use it for my Hubby's first birthday party after marriage & again it was very special occassion for us like our Honeymoon. I was taking regular follow up with Mr. Rajendra Nagi from last 2 months to get this party organized the way I wanted & get all things on track. But again on 27th Feb at 4:15 P.M. I received a call from Mr. Tapan(Manager of Seasons, Melange where party was organized) saying that I need to pay entire amount as they don't have tie up with MMT although I showed them confirmation mail that I received from MMT. Till 11:00 P.M. I was taking regular follow ups with MMT team to get it sorted out but ultimately I was so helpless as Mr. Sandeep & Mr. Amit were least interested in sorting out the matter. I was also informed that Mr. Rajendra already left the job. Hence I paid entire bill amount i.e. 6100 again. I also paid it to MMT. HEnce I paid same amount  twice because of major blunder of MMT. Again & again there were n number of persons who communicated with me & I narrated entire my disgusting experience to each & every guy. But this was not much to test my patience, finally MMT spoiled my party in Melange too. I paid 1902 extra to MMT as Rajendra told me to do so. Now my honeymoon & my hubby's party is not going to come back. It was all spoiled due to MMT. I was literally crying in entire party & my honeymoon 1st day.MMT played with my feelings again & again. I am telling you guys not to book any sort of package with MMT as it is the worst site that I had ever experienced. In my next review I will come up with all proofs & communication that I had with MMT in order to prove my point. The major reason for writing this review is that MMT is least bothered in responding to my mail & getting my issue sorted out. MMT will pay for this heavily that's my promise.",1
2400,"I have specially created an account on Mouthshut to vent my grievance on these extremely unprofessional, crude guys. Every time I have cancelled a booking, getting money back from these uncouth, senseless, brainless individuals has been a pain. But this time, every limit has been crossed. An amount of INR 3, 000 was deducted from my Wallet but the entire amount was billed on the ticket. Hence, a bokking that was worth 7k is now costing me 10k. Have a look at the below mentioned break-up yourself to see how ill-managed their software is. *Total Amount Rs. 10, 081* FARE SUMMARY Total Base FareRs. 4, 520 Fee & SurchargesRs. 2, 368 Covenience FeeRs. 350 DiscountRs. -90 SEATSRs. 0 GRAND TOTALRs. 7, 148 Did you see guys? The amount charged should have been 7148 but they have charged me 10081. Sh*t happens, I understand. But now when I am calling the customer care, the guys are repeatedly making me tell my query and thereafter putting me on hold forever and I have had to disconnect call each of the three times in frustration, hearing to their meaningless caller tune. Even the Wikipedia says that these guys are in bad repute for the refund issues but this is extremely frustrating. If they had invested 1% of the sales effort in the post-sales efforts, I won't be typing this! Disgusted!",1
2401,"Useless & worst services ever. No proper response to client. #CmorpheushumanrCompany just to make money witmorpheushumanut any concerned about clients Not accepting the mistakes done by the staff. My recommendation to all of you is, not to use make my trip services in fact it smorpheushumanuld be named as #fakemytrip Let me explain you why? NN2301010108602 is my booking id. I had booked the ticket via makemytrip from Dubai to Mumbai & Mumbai to Dubai for 06th Feb 2015 & 10th Feb 2015 respectively for jet airways. Unfortunately I missed my flight because I was late from Dubai To Mumbai flight. So witmorpheushumanut any notification, information, call and contact they cancelled my return tickets i.e.from Mumbai to Dubai i.e. on 10/02/15. This thing I came to know once I reached at airport for check-in on 10th Feb 2015. Jet airways told me that as I did not traveled with jet airways from Dubai to Mumbai so automatically your ticket from Mumbai to Dubai is cancelled. I had requested them allot because I had an important meeting on 11th Feb 2015 in the morning every thing would be in loss. Just because of@Makemytrip. Wmorpheushuman is Jet airways to cancel my tickets as I paid to make my trip, witmorpheushumanut even notifying or informing me? Secondly when I was on the airport I had called to make my trip more than 4 to 5 times with different numbers and spoken with Sahil, Preitty(two times), sharma etc. Nobody provided me the solution instead they put my call on morpheushumanld in the morpheushumanpe of solution & disconnected after wamajeechang for morpheushumanurs an morpheushumanurs for connecting them because client servicing executives was very busy. Also committed to me for cheap ticket instead of their mistake on the spot & I agreed to aishwaryasingh23 but the cheap tickets costs was 32000 rs. for same day at-last I had booked my ticket from other airways i.e Air Arabia for 19000 rs. I want total refund as you did not informed me neither co-operated with me from anyway. Then I put my query on Facebook on there page@MakeMy Trip so they had responded me with excuses but not with my refund. you can see the conversation for which they turned from the commitment again & again. I want few answers from make my trip Did you notify me about the cancellation of the ticket? I paid the booking charges & ticket fund to make my trip or Jet airways? If you are not able to solve the issue than, you hangup the pmorpheushumanne or put the clients call on morpheushumanld for morpheushumanurs an morpheushumanurs? Is this type of services you are providing? On call you told me that you would be solving my issue with in 48 morpheushumanurs, also you have mentioned in comment ""48 morpheushumanurs"". Did you replied even after 48 morpheushumanurs? Atlast after 12 days of struggle Make My trip had refunded hardly 1900 rs instead of my losses after 12 days i.e. on 22/02/15 which is not even the 1/4th of my losses. I want all refund with the losses which include return fare charges+ my new ticket(Mumbai to Dubai)+ Taxi fare to & from the airport to my morpheushumanme+ Sharjah to Dubai taxi fare+ An apologize letter for the behavior. please check the below link.

2405,"Don't go by the catchy Ads- They really are ""Miseries Unlimited"". A company that runs their entire business online, does not care to respond online. Their customer care/ grievance redressal mechanism is an eye wash and they are using the cover of virtual space pretty well to suit their malafide intents. For an online business, nothing can be more criminal than that. I had booked a return ticket for four in Indigo(BLR-CCU-BLR) at MakeMyTrip.com(PNR: JC582X). I tried to cancel one-way tickets for two of the four(CCU-BLR) over phone 24 hrs. before the travel date in Dec last. I was asked to use Online Cancellation as phone service was supposedly experiencing problems. I cancelled the same online under guidance of MMT Customer Care. I got a confirmation by SMS and a new ticket for the remaining two travellers were re-issued(See attachment). But money was NOT refunded later. MMT Customer Care said the airline refused to refund. I contacted Indigo. They went on record saying ""No Such Cancellations Request was made by Makemytrip""(See Attached Mail). I tried to contact and exhausted all the available options(in a 4-Tier Grievance Redressal Procedure right upto the ""Management""), but did NOT get a single reply from MakeMyTrip! They have cheated me, crudely misguided me and have seriously breached all measures of ethical service. The most dangerous part here is not really the cheating, but the sheer negligence of the customer's grievance right up to the management level(See attached file)l! They are not only cheats but also dangerous in their unethical practices. I had used their services several times before but I only got to know their fraud business practices with an eye-wash of a Customer Care only when I had to make an exception(cancellation in this case). Avoid MakeMyTrip, if you have even the minutest of chances of ever going to be stuck in an aberration. MakeMyTrip is fraud and a deliberately deaf fraud at that.",1
2406,"Makemytrip doesn't keep its promise on rewards program. They don't really award the ""2 nights 3 days free at luxury property"" for eligible members. They just dupe people on false promises. My makemytrip compaint reference id: 150123-035410 I'm a platinum tier member in Makemytrip rewards program. Their reward program states this very clearly. 1) 2000 Bonus points on booking 6 Room Nights or 3 Holiday Packages 2) Additional 2000 points on booking 10th Room Night 3) Free 2 Nights & 3 Days Stay in a Luxury property(on tier retention) if a platinum member retains its membership by earning 4000 points in a year, that customer is awarded ""2 nights 3 days free stay in a luxury property"". First of all, they didn't my credit bonus points as per rule#1 and rule#2(stated above) once I completed 10 room nights. So I raised complaint on Jan-23, 2015 with their customer service. Reference id: 150123-035410. After  verifying my bookings, they wrote in e-mail on Feb-3, 2015 that my bonus points will be credited in 10 working days. Till now i.e even after 20 days, they haven't credited the same. Reason being, if they credit my 4000 bonus points, then I automatically become eligible for the free 2 nights stay award(due to tier retention policy). I called them after their first deadline of 10 days, second time, I was promised over phone on Feb-13, 2015 that both bonus points and hotel stay voucher will be given to me within 7 days. Again they didn't full-fill it within promised timeline. I escalated the request thro' their website for which I got an automated e-mail saying special ""We care"" team will respond within 48 hours. Its been 8 days since then, still no response. It seems that they only make false promises to make their product attractive, where-as in real, makemytrip really doesn't full-fill those reward program policies and worst of all they don't give a damn about complaints raised through their customer service channel. For certain complaints like mine, they just keep it hanging forever.

2416,"If you are struggling to get a refund or you had issues getting a refund in the past or know of someone who had issues with MakeMyTrip.com please sign/forward the petition below: http: // http://www.indianvoice.org/unscrupulous-business-conduct-by-makemytrip-com-petition.html Bottom line: if you have enough money to let it sit at MakeMyTrip and have enough time and patience to follow up with their support team, for unsuccessful booking, go ahead and use this website/app. Otherwise Be aware and stay away from this poorly managed   incompetent team of MakeMyTrip. So here's my first and only experience with this website: I tried to book a round trip domestic flight for my family of 5 members using MakeMyTrip. Quite efficiently, MakeMyTrip took my money but my booking was unsuccessful. And here's my sequence of fun and happy events with MakeMyTrip. I immediately called MakeMyTrip support and then I learnt I should answer few support executives before talking to someone who can help me. Finally, someone said he can help me and when I asked why they took my money without a successful booking, sure enough, he had no answer. I asked him to refund my money because I don't want to try to book again, but he said they have a process to refund money after 3 business days. I got really upset because he didn't know why my booking was unsuccessful   he had no interest in helping a customer. He kept repeating like a recorded voice mail message that it is their process. I was like hell with this guy and hung up the phone and decided to wait for 3 business days. 3 business days went by and there was no refund. Again, I called customer care. This time the support guy at MakeMyTrip took all my details. He didn't sound like he understood my English so I was patient giving him my booking details for around 5 minutes. After taking all my details, he said his system was under maintenance and asked me to call back in 2 hours. I got really upset not because of the only reason he couldn't help me but he just wasted my time taking down all details. At this point, I have spent enough frustration with MakeMyTrip folks so I had very little frustration left and so I just hung up the phone. Next day, I called up MakeMyTrip, this time surprisingly a support executive had an answer( as usual that turned out to be unreliable) . He said just because I am banking with HDFC, refund takes 6 business days. I waited 6 business days and there was no refund. My brother decided to walk in to one of the MakeMyTrip locations in Chennai. He walked in to an office and got advised that an email has been sent to a manager and that we would get our money back in 3 business days. Again, we did wait for 3 business days. Meanwhile, I found that there is a support site for MakeMyTrip customers and that everytime I call support number support executives are opening and closing my case immediately. There was an option for two levels of escalation and finally an escalation to management with a wait time of 48 hours. So I decided to reopen a support ticket and escalate it. Ticket was escalated to first level and there was no sign someone even looked at it. After 48 hours, I escalated the ticket to second level. Again, no sign anyone even looked at it. After 48 hours, I escalated the ticket to management. Geeta from Customer Delight team sent an automated email stating she would personally review my email and get back to me. I realized she is from MakeMyTrip as well and she will not do what she says . My brother decided to walk in to the office again, this time the guy who helped my brother out earlier had a day off. The guy who came forward to help him this time washed off his hands saying we booked our flights using online website so he couldn't help at MakeMyTrip office location. I learnt how support team at MakeMyTrip is pretending that they are working but in reality their support to customer is not worth a penny. From my experience, MakeMyTrip team has no interest in their customer but has interests only on their petty process. otherwise, the guy who answered me initially would have called whoever needs to get called and given my money back. MakeMyTrip is far below in performing that 1 star rating is too high for this app website. I cannot believe this management of incompetent people are unaware of what is going on and are creating too much hassles to people who use their website.",1

You will understand the story as you read below: Hi, I am a regular customer of Makemytrip unfortunately since 3 years and as you can see I'm too lazy because I haven't switched to the other travel help sites yet. In these 3 years, I have booked flights at least 20 times(all through Makemytrip) and more than half of these consist of international flights. You might be wondering why all of a sudden I'm writing this mail to you after 3 years. Was the service good in these 3 years? The answer is No. The service has been pathetic(yes, literally) since beginning. I work in an MNC in Gurgaon and I do not have time to write long mails even though I love to. I rather tend to ignore things, but then I do not tolerate any misbehavior from other's end and this mail is a result of my patience being tested to the utmost limit. I can go on and on describing your company but I will just stick to my 2 major complaints: Back in December last year I wanted to cancel my return flight from Frankfurt to New Delhi and since your'amazing website' did not permit me to cancel online, I had to call up your customer service. After waiting for 1 hour on the line(not exaggerating) I was put on line with this guy who took 20 minutes(again not exaggerating) to confirm the cancellation of my flight. Wait, that's not the complaint. This guy after 10 minutes mails to me telling me that he calculated the refund wrong and that the amount refunded will be something else. So he apologizes and tells me that he did not cancel it and that I would have to call up the customer care again. Do you think I have time to spend another hour waiting on your lines for his bloody mistake? If it's his mistake should't it be his courtesy to call me back? I'm sure you have caller IDs, and if you don't I won't be surprised. (ATTACHMENT 1) I called up again and waited in line another hour to get it cancelled. It was cancelled ultimately. Guess what? It's been a month and I haven't got my refund back yet. (ATTACHMENT 2) What is this service about? Do you guys intentionally do it to p*ss off customers? Is it a company policy to shove away customers? Yes? See I have lots of things as well regarding your'unfriendly user interface' of the site but that's none of my problem now as I won't be using Makemytrip again. I just want to get myRs. 28k refunded ASAP. Request you to look into this matter urgently. Regards Vibhash Joshi",1
2426,"An open letter to the CEO of MakeMyTrip, Mr. Deep Kalra. To, Mr. Deep Kalra Chairman & Group CEO MakeMyTrip Inc. Dear Sir, I have been a customer of your services for over 3 years. On the 13th of January 2015, I booked a Jet Airways flight ticket for the 16th at 2:55am from Mumbai to Chennai(9W-463). Booking ID NF2204048301804. The trip was planned on a short notice as I was visiting my grandmother who’s health is deteriorating. The booking was confirmed and the entire payment was made. On the next day, i.e. the 14th at 7:43 pm, I received an SMS from MakeMyTrip claiming that they have received my cancellation request for the above mentioned booking.  The reason for cancellation mentioned in the message was “Flight Non Operational.” I was shocked on receiving this message. I panicked as I was supposed to leave the following night and called up your customer care service. Unfortunately, your executives were busy & I waited on hold for about 40 minutes. Since I did not have the patience to wait on hold any longer, I tried to find out your office numbers but to no avail. My parents were in Chennai at that time and they were worried too. I called it a day and decided to contact MakeMyTrip the next morning. On the 15th, I called up Jet Airways since I wasn’t expecting anything from you. I asked them if the flight was functional and they said that the flight was scheduled as planned. I then asked them about my reservation and they told me that my reservation had been cancelled. When I asked them for the details regarding the said cancellation,  they said that they could not provide me with any details as the booking was done through an agent. I had no other choice but to call your customer care again. I was talking to your executive Mr. Atul Gupta. He wasn't being helpful at all. When I asked him to transfer my call to a senior executive, he refused to do so. After being adamant, he put me on hold for around 20 minutes and finally transferred my call to a senior executive. What happened next was completely unexpected and shocking. The supervisor was extremely rude. After I said that I will take legal action, your senior executive, Mr. Sumit Shah had the audacity to tell me to do whatever I want. This type of arrogance cannot be tolerated, especially from a corporate as reputed as yours. Further, Mr. Shah had the nerve to say, ""That is all we can help you with. If you want to book another ticket with us, we are happy to help you."" Seriously? Do you really expect me to book another ticket with you Mr. Kalra? Especially after what you have put me through. You can check your calls as they are recorded, right Mr. Kalra? I took to social media as there was no positive response from your company. I posted my problem on your Facebook page. Unlike the customer care call centre, I received quick replies on the said post. After explaining my situation, they gave me the timing of the cancellation and the IP address through which the cancellation had been made. Let me put this on record Mr. Kalra, I was in college at the time the cancellation was apparently made, i.e. 4:56 pm. I have people who can vouch for this. Moreover, the IP address given to me by your company belongs to someone from Bangalore( 117.216.227.126). This is absolutely ridiculous as I live and study in Mumbai. I also have no relatives in Bangalore whatsoever.  After I brought this to your notice, your company should have forwarded my complaint to the cyber cell. You are asking me to handle this situation and putting me under further stress. It is not my fault anyway, and I have to run around solving your problem. If you still believe that your executives are right and the problem is indeed mine, I would be grateful if you found out who the Bangalore IP belongs to and take some action, instead of asking your customers to do all the work. I am not supposed to be doing this in the first place. If I really wanted to cancel the ticket and get away without paying the penalty, I wouldn’t have booked train tickets as a last resort. This is a logical explanation, isn’t it Mr. Kalra? I had paid an amount of Rs. 4701. I was charged a penalty of Rs. 2087, for a cancellation that I never made in the first place. Not only this, I had to bear the expenses of a train ticket as I had no other option and MakeMyTrip wasn’t putting me on another flight. This sum might not be a lot for you, but it is my parents’ hard earned money. After arguing with your executives, they decided to give me a refund of Rs. 250 as ‘a gesture of goodwill’. The incompetence of your executives is intolerable and ludicrous. Your executives claimed that the IP address does not belong to MakeMyTrip and they cannot help me further. News flash Mr. Kalra, it does not belong to me either. Why am I supposed to bear the burden? I would like to bring one important thing to your notice. I received an email from Gurdeep Kaur claiming that the company will cross check my complaint in 3 working days and if found at fault, will bear the loss. It has been 18 days since I received that email, I’ve had no further replies since. The way Mr. Shah spoke to me, left me with no doubt that these sort of incidents might be rampant in your company, and people do not have the resources or the courage to fight against a big corporate like yours. Is this what I get in return for trusting your brand and your company? Is this the so called ‘quality of service’ you promise? I honestly felt betrayed and I continue to feel cheated. I was forced to write this letter even though I never saw myself doing so. I was very upset that I could not make my problem heard beyond a MakeMyTrip call centre executive. You all are literally hiding behind your outsourced call centers. I was shocked to see that I couldn’t find an email address or contact number of a single manager, let alone the CEO of the company. I have had enough of this, but not without spreading the word about your service amongst my friends and family. There’s no doubt that your company is incompetent or completely unprofessional. I don’t know what effect this letter might have on your customer service, but rest assured that you will now be able to deduct my business from your annual profits if not more. Although that might be just a whisker in your overall mess, it’ll be one which was done with due diligence. We’ve had enough of your staff’s condescending attitude and have received completely inadequate service, as well as ignorance of enormous proportions, something I would have never expected from a company as big and ‘reputed’ as yours. Allow me to be clear, we do not use your services for free. You have failed miserably in meeting the expectations of your customers based on the promises you've made to them.

2427,A very clean newly renovated hotel located in the heart of the city.Excellent service and prices to fit every budget.The staff is also friendly and makes you feel safe and homely.Easily accessible for elderly folks with elevator. Food is also of good quality and is reasonably priced. Highly recommended for someone visiting Jodhpur.,5
2428,I want to share it here that some one can be saved of being a victim of this. There customer support service is bull*. And if you are going to cancel any flight ticket through this site then you will get an amount that you wish to give to a beggar. No clear details will be given in email. and if you call customer support service they will tell you many charges which are non-refundable and finally you will get only a very little amount which we can say they refund only a change against our total amount pain. Thanks,1
2429,I have used the service 2 times to book flight. I liked it. Very easy to use. Price is also very close to the airline ticket. But its always easy to check one site instead of multiple site. my review end here but mouthshut wants 300 characters to post this. sorry bare with me. ignore the rest of the characters.,5

2431,"I booked a ticket with MMT on 21st Dec 2014 for Chennai to HYD on Spicejet travels. On 22nd Dec, I cancelled the same. The refund amount was Rs. 14508. Till date, I have not received the refund amount. I checked the spicejet site and the refund has been processed from their side long back. I have been trying to contact MMT many number of times and their phone does not work. It just gives a message that they are busy due to high call volume. Even if I am able to get to someone, they just redirect it back to IVR. I have sent 3 emails till now, none of which is replied. Update, sorry for such a long delay: I got my refund from MMT long back. Actually I continued using MMT after that also and recently used MMT for my Vizag trip and experience was great! Not able to give 4 / 5 star, as mouthshut is not allowing to change the recommendation now. I will write a separate review for vizag trip.",3
2432,"I have booked Keys Hotel(Whitefield) from 31st Jan to 4th Feb through booking number NH210614589727. I have received confirmation mail. On 23rd Jan, received a call from one of the executive that they are doing cancellation of booking. On asking reason, no justification provided. They cancel the booking but no mail or SMS provided for cancellation. On constant followup only get refund amount back. On refund also they deduct 250 Rs. for cancellation. I have raised my below concerns to makemytrip team 1) How a confirm booking can be cancelled by your representative? 2) Your call center representative call and just inform that booking has been cancelled with out any reason 3) No mail or sms has been sent on cancellation Though matter is escalate till management level, no one is sensitive enough to respond on the matter. Though, I am Gold member of makemytrip but now onwards do not like to login Makemytrip Malay",1
2433,MMT has changed my payback account information without my knowledge beware of their spurious activities. Customer care do not respond properly. The most unorganised and unprofessional company which infringes your privicy beware of putting vital information on their website. It's a blame game between payback and MMT but nobody is ready to resolve the issue. Customer care people do not understand the issue and thus have no solution they have untrained customer care executives. I have stopped using MMT and would suggest the same.,1
2434,"I had booked my vacation to Dubai through makemytrip, which included show cruise, half day city tour and tickets to bhurj khalifa at the top. They had a tie up with lama tours which was just pathetic. We were made to wait for more than an hour for the dhow cruise and finally we returned without going on the cruise because the actual boat had already left and we were asked to get into a tiny boat with make shift steps with no support. I was travelling with a senior citizen and a toddler and this task was impossible. This boat would supposedly then transfer us to the actual boat which was already half way through. The city tour was extremely boring and we were hardly given ten mins at the burn al arab for photos. Since our hotel was close to atlantis, they arranged for a cab to be picked up from somewhere close by instead of going all the way to their drop off point. But little did we know that we would be dropped off on a main road, to jump over a 3 feet median and to cross over a super busy road at the middle. All this with a senior citizen and a toddler, remember. This was the worst ever trip spending os much money and time. Will never make any bookings through makemytrip ever again!",1

Please try again"" but in affect it had booked the ticket and in my case I booked the ticket again and when I requested to cancel the duplicate ticket they have deducted the cancellation charges for each person on the ticket and refunded only partial sum amounting less than 15% percentage please be careful with website message its seems to be buggy at times esp. Getting money back from them is tough.",1

Please update me if you have shut down the services or you guys booked your own ticket and left on long trip. If so then get done with your trip and get back to valid customers.",1
2437,"First things first: Never ever cancel a flight ticket booked on MMT. I did book a SpiceJet ticket from MMT with booking ID NF2202937194117 and then due to some reasons I canceled it. All problems started just then. First, I canceled thru web-site so expected that my money will come to my account soon and I did not keep an eye on it. After around 15 days, one fine day I checked it and came to know that money did not come to my account. So called customer care and told them same. Customer care executive said that we have to call them in addition to cancellation thru web-site, so then I requested for re-cancellation. Again waited for 15 days and checked account, money did not come this time as well. So called them once again. This time executive said its taking some time so wait for some time and told me to wait for around a week. Same thing happened one more time. Money did not come! Called them again! This time they said they have got money from SpiceJet and are processing so in next 4-6 working days it will be done. After 6 working days again called them up because as expected nothing happened. This time said that matter has already been escalated to highest level of team and will be done in 6 working days. Again waited for 6 days and nothing happened one more time. Called them once again and they said again matter has been escalated( if it was to highest dept last time then to which team they are escalating now? To GOD?) Called them today( around 2.5 months have passed) and they are saying I have to wait for 4 working days. As a customer, I feel trapped! I cannot do anything. They have taken my money and now I have waste 1 hour every week for MY MONEY. This is clear cheating because they know I cannot do anything. Customer care executives are clearly telling me to go to consumer court if I can do. In mean-time I booked tickets worth 75, 000 from clear-trip and ease-my-trip and canceled those. I got my money within 2 days! NEVER EVER go to make-my-trip website for flight booking because you never know when will you want to cancel it and then your money is gone. You cannot do anything even though that is your hard-earned money.",1
2438,"Even if payment fails multiple times, it may take payments later on. so wait for 30 min to get confirmation and try after 30 min again if u dont get. so keep on doing this.

2439,"I would like to personally thank you for ruining my vacation with your poor customer service and general demeanor. Planning a trip with your company was definitely memorable as I now know never to book with your company or even recommend any of my family and friends either. It all started when I decided to spend 5 days in Goa around New Years Eve. I booked my trip with Samim Khan from the Delhi. The trip total came to 68, 000 Rs. which included flight from Delhi to Goa, 4 nights at Hotel Colva Kinara, and a flight from Goa to Mumbai(Booking ID: IN1412B6S167325). I had requested Hotel Colva Kinara after finding out that other hotels were charging an extra fee for a New Years Eve Party. Samim Khan said this hotel did not have a mandatory party for their guests. I was only able to pay 20, 000 Rs. at a time with my debit card and I was going to pay for the trip over several days. Samim Khan insisted that I pay the full amount as soon as possible. In a hurry, we asked if we could pay the remainder(48, 000 Rs.) in cash. He gladly agreed and directed us to go to the Mumbai(Andheri) office on Sunday before 6pm. After rushing to get there, we were turned away by the security guard who informed us that the office closes at 5pm on Sundays. I immediately called Samim Khan and he told us that he was unaware of the hours of operation of the office that HE had sent us to for HIS company. We were frustrated that he had made me and my 80 year old grandfather run in order to make it to this office on the other side of town. The following day we went to the Mumbai office right when it had opened up at 10AM. We were now told by the staff at this location that they can only accept 25, 000 Rs. cash at a time. I immediately called Samim Khan and once again, he denied any knowledge of this rule. We ended up paying at the Andheri office and then crossing the city to the Mahim office in order to pay the remainder of the trip. At the Mahim office, Samim Khan tells me that he didn't book the package at the time when I had paid over 50% of the cost and now the direct flight from Delhi to Goa was 6000 Rs more. I calmly requested for another alternative flight that would leave the package cost at 68, 000 Rs. He gladly gave us a connecting flight with two separate airlines that stopped in Mumbai for 3 hours. We were reluctant to take this offer as it would waste a full day travelling but we were forced by the circumstances to agree. On December 26, 2014, we got on the IndiGo flight at 630AM in Delhi. The pilot and airport were constantly giving us notifications that the poor visibility conditions(57m) was below their required standard(125m). As a result, all the passengers on this flight were seated on the aircraft for OVER 4 HOURS. When the flight finally left at 1030AM, we were relieved to be on our way. Upon arriving at the Mumbai airport, we had missed our connecting flight with Jet Airways at 12:35PM. We were then told by the Jet Airways booth that they were not able to simply put us on the next flight because it was not the same airline. They were asking for 22, 000Rs to transfer us to the next flight. As this was unreasonable, I called Samim Khan and asked for a solution. He did not pick up my phone calls. I then asked Jet Airways for a fair solution. They said that they would not charge me a cancellation fee and MakeMyTrip would give me a full refund for that flight if I could find a cheaper flight. Out of desperation, I approached Akshar Travel Agency booth directly across from Jet Airways and they found a SpiceJet flight for 14, 000 Rs. I immediately paid for this flight OUT OF POCKET in addition to what I had already paid for the package. Finally, we got on the flight and we arrived in Goa. We get to the hotel and the reception informs us that there is a mandatory hotel party on New Years Eve that all guests must pay for. The hotel party costs 3, 500 Rs. per person. I had already spent 14, 000 Rs. earlier in the day and I was frustrated with travelling. I called Samim Khan again at that moment and he finally picked up. I reminded him that I had requested a hotel with no mandatory party. He ""checked"" the vouchers and assured me that the hotel did not mention a NYE party. I told him to speak directly to the hotel staff. The hotel staff told him to check the vouchers again as they had clearly put up the information. After about an hour or so, the situation was not resolved. The hotel staff refused to check us into our hotel and MakeMyTrip refused to pay for the hotel party. We didn't want to attend the party at all, we simply wanted to rest after a very hectic travel day. Samim Khan started avoiding my calls and calls from the hotel itself. I am going to assume that he recognized HIS mistake but he refused to ADMIT it and hoped that I would simply pay for it. We spent 3 hours sitting in the hotel lobby waiting for a reply from either party that the hotel would either wave the fee or MakeMyTrip would pay for it. By 11:00pm, I had gotten restless and I called MakeMyTrip customer support. The agent followed the normal protocol of asking for my booking ID. Within 2 minutes of pulling up my file, she said the computers were ""down"" and she was unable to access my file. I knew this was a lie because she would not have been able to punch in my booking ID if the system was down. She said that she would call me within 1 hour. After spending 3 hours, I refused to wait this extra hour. The hotel manager approached me and I explained my situation. I had explained to him that I did not want to attend the NYE party and nor would I pay for it. We both knew that Samim Khan had not read the vouchers correctly and knowingly he was avoiding our phone calls. He kindly requested his owner to let us check in. The hotel manager was able to convince his boss that we had a very special circumstance and our mandatory party fee should be waived. We ended up getting checked in at 11:30PM. The remainder of the trip went well without a hitch. But I was bound to get reimbursed for my 14, 000Rs and the poor customer service. Sorry, LACK of customer service. After calling Samim Khan and several other customer service agents, I had made 10+ calls and spoke for 2 hours over the span of 5 days. I simply wanted a refund on a flight that delayed due to weather. It was not my fault that the flight had been delayed and it was not my fault that my UNINTELLIGENT agent SAMIM KHAN had booked 2 separate airlines. In addition, I was willing to let the hotel reception experience pass. Samim Khan is lucky that I was patient and I begged the hotel manager to let us stay. If it was someone else, Samim Khan would have gotten an ear full. Due to the lack of customer service, I give this company a NEGATIVE 10 out of 5 rating. I will never book with this company again and I hope Samim Khan one day learns that humans make mistakes and it is how you react to those mistakes that determines your character.

2440,"This company had given me so much tension last year, that I nearly had a breakdown. And I do need to bring it on for the sake of improvement in its services. Briefly, we had approached MMT's Visakhapatnam branch to book our trip to Europe. A couple of guys sweet talked us into parting with Rs.3.16 lakh(after discount!) in June 2014 and what followed after was sheer hell. These fellows simply used to lie initially and after that switched off their phones. This way they have duped another two parties also. But after a lot of coercion(thanks to Santosh of their Hyderabad office) and some serious warnings, they did return the money but in the process, they had ruined our trip. My complaint with the MMT bosses, is that why did they allow such things to happen in the first place. Dont they check the credentials of the agents before appointing them? Anyway, it left me a lot bitter and disgusted. Hope they will keep a better check and improve their systems in future. D J RAO.",1
2441,"I advise the people to think twice before making any bookings with makemytrip. I had booked a air ticket roundtrip through makemytrip.

The journey date was Dec 19' 2014 and I had cancelled it onn Dec 10 2014. But they have failed to forward my cancellation request in time and finally airline put me no show.

2442,"I had booked thailand package from Make my trip in Jan 15. Make my trip co ordinates with ITC travel co(local vendor) for Thailand tour. The tour incharge Ms. Mohini was one hell of unprofessional lady . She does not remember people aishwaryasingh23ing her for optional tours and on day of the tour, she straightaway refused that we paid her for optional tour instead of checking her own records. Since we paid the amt in front of other passengers finally she had to give in and take us for the optional tour. we were kept waiting for 1 hr in wee hours of morning due to this confusion. On top of that she did not have basic courtesy of calling us and saying sorry. she asked the local guide Jeejee to say sorry to us. Why don't they have a system of issuing receipts for aishwaryasingh23ments made to them instead of scaring the hell out of passengers at last moment. The guides did not carry flags like guides of other travel companies which was making it difficult to locate them at the spots. also they never used to accompany us inside the spots, just leave us at the gates. we had to search for our fellow passengers instead and be relieved that we were at right spot. this created lot of confusion. Also time given at the spots like tiger temple was insufficient to fully enjoy the place. Some of the guides cud not even give information on the spots as they were not knowledgeable. All hell broke loose on last day when they actually forgot to pick us up from our morpheushumantel to the airport. The car came and picked up 5 other passengers but our names were not on the drivers list and he refused to take us. On inquiring with the guide, she had no clue and took 45 min just to check what had gone wrong. In that period we had to undergo tremendous stress as we were scared of getting late to the airport. Finally after an morpheushumanur of drama, they asked the morpheushumantel incharge to arrange a cab at their expense. Thankfully we reached on time but we had to undergo so much stress in the car as there was traffic and one of the highway was closed. So please do a favour on youself, dont go near make my trip if you want a stressfree morpheushumanliday. we learnt the lesson the hard way. they are highly unprofessional and disorganised to the core.

2444,"I was highly recommended by my peers to use makemytrip.com rather than using a travel agent. I was really excited that I could actually throw a surprise to some folks about my visit. But I was surprised myself when I got the final itinerary. I booked a flight and hotel combo, from U.S.A. for a domestic trip in India. Funny things happened. My flight was booked for 15th to 17th of the month, while the Hotel was booked for 16th to 18th of the month. When called on customer service, I was asked to call back after the I receive my e-tickets, after I receive my e-tickets via e-mail, I replied back to the bd operations that the flight tickets are messed up, I hear no response for next 7 hours. So I call back again. I am on hold for sometime(hence pain in the neck) then I hear a voice, so I request if they can be louder, yeah sir, and then the unclear voice again. Then I guessed he asked questions like what ""Windows"" did I use for booking, I say I used Macbook. Then what browser was I using, I say Google chrome. Next one is the best, ""How many tabs were on"". Funny you expected me to remember that. So now the technical team is supposed to call me back in 42 to 72 hours. I am hoping they do not tell me I don't know how to book my tickets, cause then, how come I got the hotel dates right and the flight details were screwed up and you only enter the travel dates once. I better not be charged anything extra for their mistake. My rating is solely based on the trouble that I have gone through so far and I am hopeful that I do receive attention as a customer and the problem of my travel dates is fixed before they end their internal investigation of what lead to the mix up. I promise, if my issue is given prompt attention and the matter is resolved without me having to make any calls",1

2446,"We booked return flight tickets from Bombay to goa using mmt. We asked for a change in our return flight timing. They charged my card without confirming availability with the airline. Obviously, the change didn't happen and they said they'll refund the amount charged, close to$35. It's been a month and I haven't received the amount. On talking to them, they say it's being'processed' by their accounts department. I fly frequently but I've never experienced such unethical behavior before. I plan to soon file an official complaint. I urge all readers to never use make my trip for any travel purposes, unless you really wanna be taken for a ride by these thieves.",1
2447,Obviously everyone books online for good deals. Make My Trip clearly cheats us. I have a deal code for make my trip. But when we put the deal code the final amount is not shown immediately online. Why they have to do this? I called the customer care and they say please look at terms and conditions. Till we book we will not know the final amount at all. Then I went to goibibo. I applied the code and immediately it showed the final value. Which is what everyone will expect. I will stop going to make my trip until they behave professionally.,1
2448,"I booked a retunr travel from Chicago to Mumbai through makemytrip.com. While booking the ticket on the website, I was not informed that I would need a transit Germany visa on my return journey(Mumbai - Munich - Dusseldorf - Chicago). I checked for other flights like AirCanada, and one is informed about the requirement of a transit visa before booking the flight. So to start off, this was not responsible on your part. How do you expect students(who fly various connections, whichever fits their schedule and budget the best) to know all about visa requirement? Do you not wish to inform them? After this was done and I was stopped on the Mumbai airport for not having a Germany transit visa, makemytrip did not provide any sort of help to resolve the issue. That is a company who claims to be ""India's no. 1 Travel Site"" chooses to treat its customers? No one was willing to adjust a seat in any other sector or airline to help me reach my destination on time. Makemytrip is highly unreliable and one not at all customer friendly. I would highly recommend people to not use the site for bookings!",1
2449,"Had booked two way flight from BLR to CCU - had to change my ticket on return to BLR, no response from call center had to cancel the ticket online. very bad customer care, need to wait for hours to speak to agent. will never suggest anyone to book through makemytrip.com. I cancelled the ticket 2 days in advance, they have cheated me of refund, I will never get my refund. I request all never use makemytrip.com.",1
2450,We have booked our kerala trip through make my trip and would like to share with you the experiences we had during the course of the trip. 1) There was a booking for a tempo traveller which was supposed to pick us up at the cochin airport at 9.00 pm. We were told that the driver will be a tourist guide and will take care of us for the sight seeing. The driver will be knowing hindi and english. We were surprised to see that the tempo traveller arrived at 9.30 pm at the airport. We were stranded at the airport for half an hour. On meeting the driver we also came to know that the driver knows only malyalam and does not know hindi and english. It was really surprising. But we thought we will adjust.The driver was constantly on his cell phone during the entire travel. We kept on telling him not to use the cell phone but all in vein. 2) We were placed in a JCT House boat at Allepy. The house boat belonged to a company called Thejas. We observed a glass broken for the window from which lot of mosquitoes came in. We were booked for a AC house boat. The attentdants on the boat said that the AC facility will be available for us only during 8.30pm to 6.00 am. We were sorrounded by mosquitoes but could not do anything. There were only 2 mosquito repellents in the boat. We had a booking for 4 seperate rooms. The attendants on the boat said that they will not be able to do anything to this. When the boat halted we went to the village outside and bought 3 mosquito repellent machines to take care of ourselves.The non vegerterian food was limited to only 4 pompret fishes. Rest all the meals were veg.We could somehow spend the night. 3) We were booked at Hotel 7 hills at Trivendrum. To our surprise the owner of the hotel told us that the room ACs were all problematic and he requested us to go to another hotel in the name of Hotel Samrat. When we went to Hotel Samrat we were shocked to see the hotel. The rooms were very small. There were lot of cockroaches in the room. The toilets were not clean. There was no water. We had to wait for almost 1 hour for the water in the bathrooms. To add to our discomforts the restaurent quality of food was hopeless. 4) It was only reasonably ok at Thekkady. These are only some of the highlights of the issues we had with the facilities provided. There are lot of other issues we ave not adressed. I am surprised at Make my trip being a well known company and how can they behave with their customers in such a fashion. After taking all the money does your responsibility of service get over. We tried to contact Make my trip officials but the only answer we got was there will be someone getting back to you. This is not acceptable. Have you ever checked personally whether the 3/4 star facilites which you claim are really worth saying 3/4 star. If the hotels provided by you are claimed to be 3/4 star faclities I believe good hotels will be 120 stars according to make my trip. Over all our expirience with the trip was pathetic. I would rate the overall expirience at 3 on a scale of 1-10(Where 10 is supposed to be excellent). I would request you to kindly return back the entire amount paid by us. We request your immediate reply please.,1

2452,"My experience with Makemytrip package trip to andman was very hectic and average. Package name was ""Exotic Andamans - Premium Package with Neil Island"" and you pay high only because of stay in seashell hotel .everything else was average. If at all you choose makemytrip,  I suggest to choose low package as anyways you would not get much time to stay in hotel/resort. Trip was very hectic and nothing extraordinary. Their Sales team additional promises are not fulfilled during your trip. Tour manager denied us having Luxury tent in Seashell, Neil Island even after Sales team promised it. Their tour manager told that I should complaint about sales guy who promised it. This 4 star hotel experience was also average. ""Exotic Andamans - Premium Package with Neil Island"" package on 29th Dec  by makemytrip. My experience with these hotels were not good. Seashell, Port Blair - stayed in standard room on 1st day and in deluxe room on last day. Room were good but room service was pretty bad. Delivery of order was quite late(delivery time was around 1 hr). Hotel does not have any recreational facilities like swimming pool, indoor games etc. Hotel does not have wifi service in rooms. Surprised to know about this 4 star hotel not having these kind of facilities. Breakfast was quite good with lot of options but in Dinner, veg was good but non-veg was very bad and not much varieties as you may expect in 4 star hotel. Their Bar lounge was also very slow in service. It took~50 min for them to bring our drinks. It was independent cottage type room but with sitout having no sea view as they promise on their website(https://seashellhotels.net/havelock/andaman-chalet/) Actually they have some rooms with sea view sitout but its not that attractive as you would imagine. Beach at their resort is rocky and you can't go to water to enjoy as possible in normal beach. There is no wifi, swimming pool and any other recreation facilities. Again, Breakfast was quite good with lot of options but in Dinner, veg was good but non-veg was very bad and not much varieties as you may expect in 4 star hotel. Deserts was also not good. They don't give starters(veg and non-veg) in their buffet. Having beach resort, and not having good seafood was bigger disadvantage for us. Havelock Island is best place to come. I don't suggest to come to Neil Island. There is nothing much here. It was room with common wall to other rooms but with sitout having no sea view. Actually they have some rooms with sea view sitout but its not that attractive as you would imagine. Beach at their resort is rocky and you can't go to water. There is no wifi, swimming pool and any other recreation facilities. Again, Breakfast was quite good with lot of options but in Dinner, veg was good but non-veg was very bad and not much varieties as you may expect in 4 star hotel. Deserts was also not good. They don't give starters(veg and non-veg) in their buffet. Having beach resort, and not having good seafood was bigger disadvantage for us. They did not have a la carte menu during lunch and so we had to go for lunch buffet which was also bad for us being non-vegeterian. Very much disappointed to not having good non-veg. food. Normally, with makemytrip package you would not get much to stay in hotel/resort during day time. I did not see any benefit of staying in these hotels with no recreation facilities and no good food for non-vegeterians.",2
2453,"I recently booked tickets from new delhi to new york from make my trip and received some terrible after sale service. I was typically feeling like, a shopkeeper took my money and gave threw the stuff I bought and he doesn't really care! I booked the tickets with a guy named chiranjeet, who was senior travel expert. He firstly promised me that he is gonna coordinate, and also help me with the seats preference. But nothing happened! In return when I tried to contact him or any of the person at make my trip I was either transferred n number of times or put on hold for hours. Such a poor after sale service they offer you, NOT RECOMMENDED TO GIVE BUSINESS TO SUCH PEOPLE WHO DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS! IF I COULD I WOULD'VE GIVEN 0 STAR RATINGS TO THEM! ALTHOUGH 1 STAR IS JUST FOR BOOKING!",1
2454,"I have had an awful experience with make my trip. My spice jet flight for 4th Dec got cancelled and I got a message about it on 2nd Dec. Spice jet refunded my complete amount to Make my trip on 3rd of December. But make my trip is a big chor company and they never bothered to inform me anout my refund. After calling them some 100 times they asked me to go and cancel my booking and I will get my refund in 7 working days. After doing the same and waiting for 7 working days, these idiots just vanished and stopped answering my phone and neither did they reply me mails. I had to go to consumer forum through which I got a DGCA employees e-mail id. After contacting make my trip through DGCA, I got  an auto reply that my payment is processed. This happened on 20th Dec. After making some 100 another calls and speaking to un-informed call centre employees I finally got a refund of only half my bloody amount. I again had to go through the same process all over again begging for my remaining refund. These guys are a big bloody chor and will never give you your refund. Never book your flight through them.

2455,"This is regarding booking id NP2802340014547. ""Welcome to MakeMytrip, where we create unlimited memories"" This is what we hear once we open or call makemytrip. This goes pretty well in my case, as I have this painful experience memory from makemytrip. First my entire travel was ruined by makemytrip, as after payment they didn’t confirm the booking for next 10 hours, after which you said make another booking(my fauilt, I chose makemytrip for booking my travel plan). Then after cancellation, which was done by makemytrip, not me, IT HAS BEEN 17 DAYS, I HAVEN'T RECEIVED MY REFUND. That’s not all, everytime I have go through misbehaving executives, who blames me, says “We told it will take time, you don’t need to call” well I need to call, because if I would have left the refund on makemytrip, I ould never get my money. As, you guys already sent me confirmation email refund has been done 15 days back. After that when I called your helpline number, everyday they will say we have done the refund with amount value, which never get credited to my account. But, atleast your floor manager are little comforting who will say let me check, then they will say “There is an issue in our system”  we have intiated the refund you will get it ASAP. Althouth that didn’t happen so far. To end, saying welcome isn’t enough, saying you are a brand I shouldn’t worry isn’t enough. Because if I look at your service, it’s pathtic. With NO thanks for your painful memories, Sumant. Past Entry- Frauds these guys are. This is regarding my booking id NP2802340014547. where I paid Rs 24, 298. and after making the payment these guys said booking not confirmed, please wait. After 12 hours they said you need to pay extra money for confirm booking. then I asked for cancellation. The booking was done on 23rs Dec 2014 itself, I haven't received the money yet. I spent an hour everyday calling makemytrip. Makjemytrip - Guys learn something from your competitors, I understand booking may fail, but atleast refund money. I got the refund from yatra in 2 days wihout even calling them. In your case I am calling you everyday.",1

2457,"BEWARE! Do not use makemytrip.com. I booked 5 tickets Mumbai to Goa for 13-18th January 2015. The confirmation email and e-ticket emailed to me was for 13-18th March 2015. I immediately contacted makemytrip and was asked to pay penalties of Rs. 150, 000 for date change for no fault of mine. It seems like makemytrip has deliberately set up its online system to cheat customers and make more money from them fraudulently. Since, I received my e-ticket, I have been unable to lodge an online complaint and keep getting and unexpected error. Also, my attempts to log on to manage my booking on the website are a nightmare because the website keeps going back to the home page automatically. There appears to be some random resetting that the system is doing. THEY ARE SCAMMS! DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM AS SEEMS LIKE THEIR WEBSITE IS SCAMMING. I have been able to post this on facebook, so my internet is definitely not the issue. Share this post if you have been in a similar situation where you received confirmation for an incorrect date. Chances are that you believed that you may have accidentally selected the wrong date and then paid large sums of money to makemytrip to change the dates to the correct one.",1
2458,Please don't use makemytrip.com and Yatra.com site. Within few hours of trying to purchase a ticket my card was hacked and money was used to by apps and games. Thank God for scotia bank. They caught the scam in few hours and cancelled the card. I still lost money but Scotia is investigating in order to recover it. Please be careful! Try avoiding both sites as they are a front for scamming people credit cards.,1
2459,This review is for my recent trip to Srilanka. Horrible trip! 1) I reached Srilanka and at the arrival hall there was no one waiting with the pick-up card / name card. I was searching but there was no one waiting for me. So I asked a fellow make my trip guy who was waiting for other passengers (with a plank card of other guests) that are you here to pick me up and he said no. So I asked him to help me talk to the emergency contact guy( mentioned in the hotel voucher document). Thankfully he said yes and I spoke to him. The guy on the phone said please be with the same guy he is your guide. Very unprofessional. The guy was suppose to pick me up did not event know my name and was not aware I was supposed to be picked up. 2) No Jain food provided at any Restaurant. I opted for Jain food and had informed them and documented it in the forms as well  but our guide was not informed neither the hotels were aware that they are suppose to provide us Jain food. We faced major difficulty getting basic meals at each of the locations. Jain meals were promised to us. 3) None of the hotels were of 3 star - 4 star standards. The Swiss Residence in Kandy did not have a lift and clean rooms. In spite of informing them to provide Jain food we were asked to eat from the normal buffet which had non veg and non Jain food. The hotel in Bentota - Royal beach resort was not even 2 star as they do not have basic WiFi facility and bar counter in the hotel. 4) The casino chips were never given to us. The guide asked us to pay 3000 Lankan rupees to take the 2000 casino chips promised to us as per the email sent by you. I am sure he fooled us because 3 couples who were with us went to casino and they were not asked to pay any additional amount to get those 2000 casino chips promised I have struggled in the entire trip by just eating plain rice and salad with no Jain food provided to us. I sent this feedback to make my trip but they haven't responded yet.,1

We require this document to update appropriate refund amount. The refund will be processed within 5 business days from the receipt of documents.

2464,Makemytrip.com guys promise you best services and try to hook you by accepting all your requests orally and by not putting down exactly  what they orally agreed earlier. When you point out the discrepancies they will again and again assure you of rectifying the mistake and make you pay up for the service. In case if you pay up finally then you see the true color of the management guys supporting junior staff and putting the whole blame on you as if you accepted every terms and conditions. Though you can show the proof of your email / oral communications they will never ever help you. I had a very bad experience recently where in they charged me for a 2 room hotel accommodation in Dubai and gave a studio accommodation. Overcharged and cheated with irresponsible non-cooperative management staff.I'm very much disappointed and frustrated. It is better if you stay away from this online portal for anything!,1
2465,"It is the worst site to make bookings I have ever come across until now! The rates which are shown in the home site is fraudulent. I was fooled by booking my tickets through MakeMyTrip. When I booked the tickets the rates were showing high and later it decreased drastically. When when I tried calling the customer care I had to stay beyond 1 hour online and finally I had to drop off without talking to anyone! I posted a complaint via email and gracefully I got a call from the trip adviser and when I asked about the rates fluctuation he clearly says that there is a fluctuation in the price. If I have to cancel my bookings there will not be a refund! Do you feel okay to such type of service providers?Don't you feel its disgusting about the service? Please don't make your booking through this site and get cheated, I am writing this to make you people aware and not to be fooled by such trip advertisements made by this company.",1
2466,Me and my 5 friends planned a trip to Manali in august. We booked bus tickets in advance from make my trip.and booked 5 seats in a bus ofFAUJItravels. When we reached the bus stand just about 10 mins before the scheduled departure of the bus to our utter surprise the bus had already left. When we approached Fauji travels they just told that they cant do anything and asked us to get into another bus and asked us to pay additional money. When we refused they just asked us to get down from the bus. We were in a horrible situation despite buying the ticket on time. Ultimately despite calling the Fauji travels and make my trip people we got no help and ultimately had to board the same bus paying 500 bucks extra and were given 5 back seats for 6 people. It was a horrible journey. I therefore recommend not to book a Fauji travels bus to Manali as they are big cheaters. Many of our CO- passengers also were overcharged.,1

I am not sure how I am going to get my amount refunded. Is Makemytrip is going to refund the amount. Tried calling the Makemytrip, no response from them.

Car condition was pathetic no stereo or radio smelling badly, chauffeur don't know any language except Kannada.

After 2 days they get back saying, the call record said their agents r best and they didn't goof up. of course made sense to them, I asked for the recording, for which the agent, Sunil Dutt ""MMT"" agent said, he didnt have to call recoding and will get back to me, which he didn't.

I told customer care, I have cancelled the ticket on time options doesn't matters. Cancelled means Cancelled for what ever reason. Makemytrip is not accepting the loss due to their website design fault and delaying the payment. Every time I contact customer care they have same answer that your refund is in process and update the requested date which cause more delay. Regards, Ajay Chanana",1
2478,"I had booked a round trip and was able to travel only one of the flights that I had booked. Due to some reason I was not able to travel on the other flight(return journey). Upon calling the representatives of the particular airlines, I was informed that I could put a cancellation request, thereby a refund of airport taxes alone could be processed(information which I never knew before). Upon speaking to a representative of makemytrip, I was informed that I would be refunded a minimum of Rs 350 excluding the cancellation charges of Rs 200 which makemytrip charges as I was a gold member(again, information which I never knew). Now, its been almost 10 days that I have placed a request, the website shows a refund of only Rs 115. This is bad faith from these guys. I clearly did not expect this kind of a service from makemytrip. Addition to previous I had contacted Airasia representatives. I was informed that cancellation charges i.e refund of airport taxes would be an amount of Rs 365 against which Makemytrip has shown an amount of Rs 315 for reasons unknown. An instant discount of MMT 200 had given me Rs 200 off on the transaction which has been deducted from the calculated refund amount making it Rs 115. The instant discount is supposed to be for the transaction. However, today I have received a message saying Rs 87 has been forwarded to the bank for refund. What rubbish is this? I wish I had booked my tickets through goibibo or the particular airlines itself.",1
2479,"This is suchithra. I wanted to make an complaint on makemytrip regarding my worst experience with them. we(myself and my hubby) suddenly got an idea of spending our diwali holidays in thailand. we got quotations from few travel agencies including makemytrip. though makemytrip quotation seems to be bit high, we preferred makemytrip because we thought it is reliable as our trip was suddenly planned just few days before diwali. I contacted their customer care and it was ROHIT to whom I spoke to. he gave complete details about the trip. he suggested few places and even we had few places in mind. at last we prepared a complete plan on 18th october, 2014 and I paid the complete amount on the same day which isRs  1, 12, 000  for a couple for 7 nights and 8 days and they told we will have a cash back of Rs 3000. After paying the amount Rohit stopped responding for my queries and it was ADHIL who started responding later. He used to call me often even if I dont pick his call he used to leave a text and everythin was going perfect. then we departed from chennai on 21st Oct, 2014 by night 12:55PM in THAI AIRWAYS. We spent 3 nights in phuket and on 25th we departed to Bangkok through flight by morning 10:55 and from Bangkok we went to pataya on the same day by car and we reached pataya by 3PM. On 25th the actual plan given by makemytrip was alcasar show and nooch village. But the local travel agency in pataya took us only to alcasar show. we tried to explain them but because of communication issues in Thailand they couldnt understand what we were trying to explain. On 26th they took us to nooch village and by the time we reached pataya hotel it was 2PM. and the actual plan on 26th was, transfer to bangkok from pataya on morning itself and half day bangkok city tour which starts from 12PM. It was 5PM when we reached Bangkok, so we missed Bangkok city tour. I called Adhil regarding this issue by 2PM on the same day. he told sunday was a holiday for him and he told he will call me the next day. but there was no response from him on 27th so I called him again to check the details but no proper response from him. he told his higher officer will call me on the same day. but no call from anyone. I spend 180 baht(360rs) calling him daily so I asked my father to call ADHIL and check the details on 28th. on 28th noon I got call from NISHANTH who is Adhil's boss. He told me like he will offer a dinner instead of a bangkok city tour which seems to be unfair so I didn agree and asked him to extend the tour for one more day, so that we can see city tour also. for which he told he will call me after sometime on the same day. but no call from him so I asked my father to check with ADHIL no reponse then I asked my brother to check with him but no response again. they called ADHIL more than 6 times on the same day but no proper response. then on 29th(last day of our trip) morning my brother called ADHIL again this time he disconnected my brother's call and then he switched off his mobile, which remained switched off for a long time. and atlast we finished our trip without seeing bangkok city tour and came back to chennai on 30th october 2AM. On 30th morning I called customer care and told my issues to aradhana after half an hour I got call from ADHIL. He told his boss called me once on 28th night but it came like ""the number you are trying to reach is not reachable"". I donno how he heard like that when he tried to call my thailand number because if thailand number is not reached they will hear only 3 dial tones. they will not hear any voice especially in english. and atlast he told me like they cant do anything now instead they can refund the money which was to be paid by that particular missed trip alone. I registered a complaint on makemytrip conplaints section but no calls regarding that still now. so I posted a complaint on Facebook Makemytrip page. They told they will take immediate steps. but no calls from them on 30th and also on 1st. so I again replied them on facebook like I didn get any calls, immediately I got call from ADHIL he told like they are checking with the travels in Bangkok and they will get back to me later. on 3rd I received Rs2873 as refund but not even a single call from those guys. and also we didn receive our Rs3000 cash back still now. no reply from those guys also. they is no respect also. I donno how this Rs 2873  will be a solution. I have few questions to makemytrip. I spent Rs 1, 70, 000 for the entire trip which includes 1, 12000 I paid for makemytrip. but I didn see one day bangkok city tour, can the amount which makemytrip refunded me will be sufficient for us to visit those places again? but we didn get our Rs3000 cash back also. if profit is your only motive then why targeting our happiness? are these the memories which you are mentioning under the tag line ""MEMORIES UNLIMITED"" they didn try to help us when we tried to call them more than 20 times and he even switched off his mobile. it seems to be a super great insult for me and my family. thy humiliated us and they treated us so badly. Am I right? they thought, once we reach Chennai then I cant do anything. isnt it? I still didn't get any call from ADHIL or makemytrip after that. what should I do now? what will be my solution? I have all evidence regarding the booking, phone calls including timing. I filed a complaint in makemytrip page also but no reply or any calls from them. tell me what should I do. PLEASE KINDLY TELL US SOME SOLUTION FOR THE ISSUES WE FACED. WITH UNLIMITED MEMORIES, SUCHITHRA",1
2480,I had made my travel bookings through make my trip. It was return journey via flight from Mangalore to Mumbai. Make My Trip duly sent me all the message of the travel details and the flight departure timings. Even on mail and also via messages it kept me informed for the same. They conveyed to me that my flight departure was for 07:35PM. This information was totally wrong as the departure time of the flight was of 6:05 PM. I was about to miss my flight because of this. I had to face lot of issues to arrange for the last minute transportation to reach to the airport also. After reaching Mumbai I complaint to make my trip for their gross mistake and asked them to compensate me for the same. The make my trip representative didn't even accept it is the mistake from their end. Infact they started blaming the airlines for the same. Then also for so many days their website kept showing wrong timings for the flight departure. There is no reply from the company to acknowledge their error and compensate me for the hassles i had to face. Such a carelessness is not at all accepted for showing wrong timings for the flight departure. They didn't communicate it till the end for the wrong flight timings. Its hopeless service from them and also denial to take accountability of the same. Will never use make my trip for any further travel plans.,1
2481,"I will be to the point here. I Booked a flight ticket with booking id - NN230225282667 from makemytrip.com. I wanted to prepone it. Sounds simple enough right? Not with makemytrip. I have been calling them since yesterday, The new flight ticket rates are actually MUCH cheaper than my original booking. So I thought I just had to pay the modifying charge but nothing for the fare difference or if I am lucky I won't have to pay anything. I called them 28 hours ago and they told me that they cannot get the new fares so call us back after 2-3 hours. I called and they repeated the same thing, When I argued a little bit they asked me to call Etihad airways(My airline) and talk to them. The airways told me that we cannot help you since you have booked the ticked with a third party vendor so you have to deal with them. I again called after 3 hours and a girl named ""Priyanka"" told me this time that their system is down(New excuse) and again she asked me to call in 2-3 hours. I told her that I will call in 12 hours but please make sure the ticket can be modified by then. She ""ASSURED"" me that it will happen. I called 12 hours later and to my surprise it was the same reply. I got angry on the guy and asked him to call his senior. He finally after half an hour of argument gave the phone to a guy named ""Nikhil"". He told me the same thing again. Now the modification charges are 250$ and cancellation charges are 450$. So I told him that I will make a new booking, just cancel my ticket in 250$ because you cannot deal with etihad airways. It is not my fault if you cannot contact them or they are not releasing the fares for you. He said no to that too and kept asking for 24 more hours. After 15 mins more of argument he said ok give me 4 hours and I will do something. I called them back again and asked for Mr. Nikhil but a guy named ""Puneet"" told me he can help me and Nikhil is busy. He checked again and the same reply that fares are not available. When I told him that ok cancel my ticket and pay the penalty he actually told me that ""Why should I pay the penalty. We are not running the airlines"". I was shocked, I told him how can he tell me that when it is your business, You are running the website. It is your responsibility to deal with airlines and the bookings. The guy actually almost shouted back on me. He told me it will take 24 hours no matter what and we cannot do anything, If the ticket prices increase then also it is on me and they can't do anything about it. Now I am a student and 1170$ (Which is a lot of money for a student) was my ticket price and 250$ for the modification which I am ready to pay but they are not ready to accept and somehow that is my fault. I am still waiting and thinking what to do about it, I will file a complaint in the Consumer court of India about it but meanwhile please share it on their wall so that they will stop behaving like this with consumers. Thanks, Mukul Sharma My fb profile link - https://facebook.com/Moldyrocks",1
2482,"Make my trip service and call centre are pathetic whenever due to genuine reasons like accidents and  family deaths also if you miss a flight, make my trip charges you double the amount inspite of airlines agreeing to a penalty fee only  all airlines only charge a penalty fee. But this service provider doubles it and call centre guys are the biggest cheats at Gurgaon, they never pick up ur call once they get your ticket no put you on endless hold also they want to make their own commissions so they frame up different charges and command you to pay the same. Even after payment they dont issue tickets for final boarding they shall issue you a amedus booking itinieary showing confirmed and when your date arrives they ask you to pay extra penalty charges. can provide proof of everything what I have written, their complaint escalation system never works and complaints are never escalated to managerial level infact their manager advises the call center operator to screw the customer.

2483,"I recently booked tickets from Pune to Chennai, the fare summary as well as travel summary in the search never showed anything about the flight being non refundable. To my surprise I booked a ticket for AM thinking that its PM, now the website does not let me cancel the tickets because the fare is non refundable. Attached is the screen shot of their search page clearly indicating no mention of the fare being refundable. My question is if we are supposed to look at these things in each page, shouldnt the search itself show that the flight is not cancellable, I've just lost about 15k because their website is poorly designed and not user friendly. I seriously wish our legal system would accept such cases, I'd definitely like to sue the website for information withholding. Any email to their customer service takes more than 24 hours to respond, they almost never answer all queries as well. I generally prefer booking tickets from the flight website itself but I was moron enough to try this site this time. PS the incident id is - Incident ID: [141023-033177]",1
2484,"Don't ever book a flight from makemytrip website. We had booked flight for two people from Bangalore to goa. The technical glitches in their website resulted in booking of one ticket at the price of two. On calling these people we are always asked to wait for next four more days every time. We are neither getting any response from the cheats nor our money back. It's more than 2 weeks now.  The ticket prices are rising for the said flight. May I ask you cheats, will you pay for the increased charges since it is bcoz of you that we can neither book the tickets nor can get the stuck amount refunded. Your call centre services sucks. You have to wait one hour listening to that head paining recording each time we had to call you. I owe an answere from you.",1
2485,"I had a confirm booking from Udaipur to Mumbai for my vacation plan in December in jet airways which I booked the multi city tour via MMT. Udaipur to Mumbai was my last leg of travel plan& I got a mail frm MMT stating that there has been cancellation from the airlines side& I can re-book my tckt on https://makemytrip.com .bcos anyhow I need to join bck my work as per the plan& bcos I believed the mail frm MMT I promptly went ahead& booked a very costly ticket on another flight.In the meanwhile, my husband went on Jet airways site& checked that our flights were not cancelled& our tickets show a ""confirmed"" status.we then called jet guys& we got to knw that they hv just rescheduled us on a 5 min earlier flight without any extra charges.so now I have two tckts from Udaipur to Bombay travelling on same day with MMT. Till date MMT guys have not reverted me back on my mail which I sent them after several attempts to get in touch with their customer support desk.they don't have a LIVE person at their customer support desk bt jst the automated machines. I hv no way to contact them.& in this week itself MMT guys repeated exactly the same scene on our another booking to Delhi. now we clearly feel that this is some kind of false/fraud racket with make my trip where they leave us with no option bt to make another duplicate booking& we end up with 2 tckts. I am never gonna travel on MMT & will make sure that people in my circle know about their forgery soon.I came to this review site after my several attempts to get in touch with MMT guys. Pls be careful& don't rely them for ur air bookings for sure.& if at all u do then be sure to cross check with airline guys when they send u a mail stating falsely that ur flight has been cancelled bcos this is how they juice out duplicate cost from one passenger.if any of u knw how to contact them then pls provide me a no. where I can speak to a LIVE person.

2486,"In 18 years of travel, I cannot remember such inefficiency.All I asked for was a change to my ticket. I called 8 times, sent 5 emails, even visited the local office. They kept saying yes, we will, then did not even bother to call back. I had to endure 7 hours more on a 2nd connecting flight and collect and recheck in my bags twice! They are slow, inefficient, not knowledgeable, untrained, just give any answer to end the call. Managers do not get back to you on time. Be prepared to have a lousy, frustrating experience if you use them. If it goes smoothly, it is just by chance, not because of the company. Use the airline website directly, much faster, better customer service.",1

I paid my full tour amount on 26 of Sep 2014. Then I was told that my hotel booking will be doned and my hotel vouchers will be sent on my mail. but to my surprise there is no hotel voucher for my munnar stay, so I contacted Mr arun pal chouhan of MMT and told him same. Then I received call from holiday heaven hotel  in munnar that my booking through MMT is not happening as they are already sold out for the date, so on 1 oct a again contacted MMT for my hotel booking and I got two names of hotel and asked me to choose from them so I chose, but Mr Nikhil nair called me after 4hrs and told me that it is also sold out and told me to wait till 6th of oct due to multiple holidays, I waited till 6th oct, no call received.

2488,"I had very bad experiences with MakeMytrip In hotel booking their executive confirmed me cashback but after booking completion. I did not received that, after followup with them every time they have new excuse. So don't believe on MakeMytrip. In bus booking also they did same thing. During the booking I got popup on ICICI back for cashback I used that but after completion of booking I did not received the same. During the travel I checked the fare with other travelers. They board the bus 2 hour before from my boarding point but I shocked when he told me that we was charged 250/- less than me even his travel distance more than me. During the booking they allocate the seat number but when you board the bus you can be assign any seat. They don't do that they promise. Please think again if you are planning the booking by MakeMytrip.",1
2489,"I booked a flight ticket for myself and 3 of my friends through makemytrip from Bangalore to Jaipur. As soon as the booking was done and the Booking ID was generated, I realized that I had given the destination wrong. Instead of Blr-Jai-Blr. Had given as Jai-Blr-Jai. I called up customer care and after waiting for 20 min, got to speak to a customer representative. Had  a tough time understanding what he was telling. He seemed to be sleepy/drunk or chewing something and talking. Anyway, I explained the situation to him and he said, he will get back in a minute and he did and here is what he says, ""Maam, you can reschedule or cancel the booking and Make Mytrip Charge of 1500+250 per person will apply"" I was shocked.! 7000 Rs loss for a typo.? And this after calling up customer care within 5 minutes of booking.? I asked him if he can speak to his manager and see if anything can be done.He just put me on hold for 2 min, pretending to be checking with manager and came back and told the same answer. I then asked if I can speak to manager and he says, ""manager is busy. call after 1 hour"" which I understood is another technique to avoid the discussion as calling back after 1 hour and again waiting for 15 min adn then explaining the whole story to some other drunk/stupid customer rep didnt seem worth to me. So decided to go ahead with cancellation and book through some other site which will understand customer situations and not just have puppets to repeat the same line whatever be the situation.",1

But I didnot get any refund of last booking. It is the policy to cut only 3, 500 on the booking whereas the booking is showing 34, 000 ticket. It demands 11, 000 extra over 22, 000. What the hell is it? Cancel all my bookings now.  I want all the refund. I am highly pissed off with this site now.I have always made my bookings from this site but now this is highly irritating.I considered this site to be user friendly but you have really tested my patience.I have been calling on customer care numbers since 4 days and no one picks up the call . I have also held it for more than an hour everytime. I also sent email complaints. I didnot get any respond. If you people donot have the man power to pick up the calls of the customers, donot brag about customer services .

2491,"And IT IS TRUE! I had read about it a lot of times earlier and now tasted the bitter truth myself. They say, It goes well till you go along as they say and as they charge(They means MakemyTrip). But the moment you face any issue, they disappear like a needle in Haystack. and when I say it, I MEAN IT, friends! I had cancelled my Air tickets cancelled from Indigo and they refunded the amount to MakeMyTrip as I had booked the tickets from there. It had been two days of excruciating attempt to reach out to reach out to CSR ppl before I gave up. I have never seen dumber customer support than MakemyTrip. You will not stay alive to cross the excruciating IVR setup and if you do, the call will autodisconnect asking you to login to MakemyTrip site to customer support page. ""If It had worked, I would have done it earlier myself, Morons!"" The customer support page does not let me post the issue, blocking with different blocker messages and popups. Finally I took help of Facebook and Twitter. and thank god, first ray of hope! They replied! Can you believed, they did! They asked the booking details and said, they will call me back, which they did not! I kept waiting and waiting . and waiting! I kept asking about the status, no reply. And then finally, one day they showed up congratulating me that they had resolved the issue! Whoaahh, I was surprised if this was an issue at all . It was a simple ticket cancellation flow which did not required MMT to intervene itself. They just had to fwd me the money airline had refunded. I checked the mail and was shocked to see I got half the amount of money on my ticket. They had deducted Rs 2425 for each ticket per head. While It was supposed to be Rs 1500(the cancellation charges are rs 1500 for ticket cancellation from Airline directly and rs 1750 if cancelled through MakeMyTrip). And surprisingly, the refund mail said nothing. It just said ""4583 -1750(it should be 1500 instead)= 2333"". This mathematics does not make sense to 5 year old kid too. So I gave up .! I cant believe that'I' gave up. You know, I am kinda person who just can't accept customer harassment. But shocked to the core as I am, this is a company who does not give a damn at all. Not even Social media! Anyways, the moral of the story is, Never go for this site. or make it the last resort.I may sound like a disgruntled customer(which I am), but trust me the kind of response I received from MMT, I am shocked to the core.  I dont care about the money lost, but a company with customer facing must have a process who at least listens to customer issues.

2499,I have just spoken to Mr dharmendra singh . My booking id is NN230349158644.  I had made a booking on the 26th of august 2014 from mumbai to thailand business class. There was a booking failuire from your end.I have been charged for your fault. And you charged my credit card with the full amount of the ticket. On the 26th of august you told me the refund will take 10 working days.  You sent me a confirmation for refund on the 30th of august. I Have still not recieved any refund. Firstly let me make it clear that I will not pay any interest for your delay I will go to consumer court and all the social media sites because this is unprofessional. I have called hsbc hongkong bank 10 times and everytime they tell me there is no refund. And Everytime you guys tell me check with the bank. This is ridiculous. They have asked me to send a credit card statement now. I have sent them the same. But I will take this matter to court if you guys are not efficient and quick. Please send me the cash to my mumbai address right away as I cant wait any longer and il make the payment myself its already been over 20 days and I will have to pay interest for no fault of mine. This is ridiculous. My number is 9833684022. Get back to me right away or I will take this further. I have been more than patient  with this now. Please revert now. I have made all my bookings through makemytrip but from now on I and my family will never. This is all a lie. I am going to take this online on social media in every way and go to court . resolve this right away. I am not going to pay interest for this. it has already been 24 days.And to top all of it. EVERYTIME I MAKE A CALL TO MAKE MYTRIP THEY SPEAK TO ME AND THEN DISCONNECT THE CALL EVERYTIME I TELL THEM TO TRANSFER ME TO A SENIOR. THIS IS RIDICULOUS AND A SUPERB WAY OF CHEATING YOUR CLIENTS.

The four step escalation level that you have feels like a useless escalation matrix to me.Even after escalating it your management I didn't get a response. I booked a flight ticket and on the confirmation page I got the booking shown for 16th November but when I paid the amount, I received the ticket for 17th November. I contacted on your customer care numbers but they were of no use. I also contacted your various escalation levels of support but never seen anyone bothered for their customers. Even the management is not interested for the customer's delight. Thanks for providing the worst customer experience and telling that there is something called the ""poorest escalation matrix"" that you people have as nobody from your organization not even bothered to contact me in the last 8 days even after so many follow up's and complaints. You indeed write correct lines ""you can always make memories"" because this horrible experience of support and customer service have made an everlasting and worst memory experience. Hope you don't do this with other customers. Thanks, Deepak Even after writing these all, Make my trip deleted my comments on Facebook just to make sure that nobody sees it.",1
2501,"I was booking a flight using makemytrip website and when I was proceeding with payment, I got a call from a representative saying they can book the same ticket with a 10k discount. There started by bad time, I started giving the passenger details and meanwhile saw the flight price getting reduced by 2k every 5 minutes on the website and more cheap flights getting added for the same date! I asked the representative if I can proceed booking myself for the cheaper price, but the representative smartly blocked my ticket for a higher price with incorrect passenger details. He booked an adult ticket for my 2.5 year old child causing me 8k extra charge and was not ready to take the blame until I shouted and told him that I have email proof that I sent my child DOB to him. But it dint stop there, they were not ready to compensate for the extra money that I had to pay for his mistake. Then they said they will change the adult ticket as child ticket in the eticket and that they will give a call but I never received any such call.I have to travel in 1 week time and lost both my peace of mind and money.Highly manipulative agents and have total disregard to customers",1
2502,"Today I booked three ticket from Pune to Delhi in morning and it cost me 5150/- per ticket after that when I reopen makemytrip around 3:30 to recheck current ticket rate I shocked to see that ticket rate has decrease and it is 3000/-, I really didn't understand how it is happen. It was a considerable difference for 2000/- per ticket, I booked three ticket means I pay extra >6000/- just because I booked my ticket early.  Here I want to mentioned that I was looking for same airline and same flight rate. And customer guyes said that it happens. when I said I will never prefer makemytrip she replied that ""as you wish"".",1
2503,"My son had booked Air Tickets for his trip to Manchester UK and back through Make my Trip.com on 8th September, 2014 by Virgin Atlantic Airlines. When we refer their website it was showing at INR 52, 835. When contacted, their representative told my son that now that fare is not available and the ticket will cost about INR 61, 000. and he informed that now onwards this ticket will not available at the fare lower than this. They also informed that this ticket is refundable while actually it is not refundable. After lenghty disscussion, he offered a discount and finally agreed for INR 58, 706 and the ticket was booked at 2.00 am in the morning. The next day, the same ticket was available on their site for INR 52, 835. and is still available after two days while I am writing this comment. I feel, due to not having experience to deal with them and blindly trusting them, I feel they have taken undue advantage and made profit for them by overcharging me. As far as possible, I will try to avoid them in future. The justification of lower fare later by them is due to cancellation of tickets by other passengers which result in lower fare seat become available for booking and their system detects a lower fare amount immediately and they offer them to the customers.",1
2504,"I booked a to and fro return flight from Chennai to Bangalore - Air Asia on makemytrip for 2 adults and an infant. The ticket showed all three names for both legs(onward and return) of the journey, and the invoice paid for all three individuals for both legs of the journey. Nothing untoward happened in my onward flight from Chennai to Bangalore. On my return, at the Bangalore airport, Air Asia informs me that the infant is not registered on the ticket(the infant is registered only for onward flight and not return flight) and makemytrip has charged for the infant for both legs, infant name printed on ticket for both legs, and not informed the airline. Air Asia asked me to pay an additional amount for the infant in the airport, which I did, else travel would not have been possible. Simple booking of tickets, makemytrip is not able to coordinate with the airline. I was put to a large amount of stress, harassment and mental pressure in the airport. If I were in the US, I would be suing makemytrip for mental harassment. In future, I will not use makemytrip.",1

2506,"Makemytrip.com Review want to book ticket from Makemytrip.com. Please concern the followings before you get entangled into: 1) Will charge you the same or most of the time more than the other sites. Go for the sites which offer your the least price. 2) the customer care executive will say you sorry every time you say or ask something and many of them have little experience with the international flight booking. they will do a search and will tell you the same what you are also seeing in the site. 3) if you ask for a flight combination, they will provide you with the same that the search engine does, no customized combination can be generated. No multi city flight booking. 4) will nag you continuously until you book and most importantly pay and will threat you that the price will rise if you dont pay, even you have blocked the seat(s), several times the price may fall. dont trust them. Once I have booked seat, other sites gives some days and in that period that seat will be kept in hold for that price only. 5) after booking if you ask them for seat details, they will say, all of a sudden, that it is chargable(better if you talk about seat blocking beforehand), pathetic 6) the local travel agents or the regional offices of the flight agencies will provide you better options and better deals then this site, check with them before booking. 7) will never warn you for transit visa and will never mention whether at all it is required 8) will never tell you that when you transfer from a domestic flight to an international flight, you have to pick up your luggage and then again international check in, will not tell you where to go through a custom check and then check in again 9) there are better and sites with cheap deals 10) will not even provide details of the terminals and the seats available for many flights 11) will not ask your food preferences for the flight 12) the leg space is very narrow in some flights, be careful before booking and ask for it. 13) will not allow extra luggage for students, while a local agency or regional office can. 14) The most important thing is that overall the after sales service is very bad. They are not so much bothered once you have bought the ticket. If you have booked a ticket, chat service will be disabled for you. the only chance of talking with them is through phone and that even after a long waiting  time. havent tried emails, I dont have so much patience. there is no reason that you should pay more and dont get anything extra.

2507,"I want to share a recent correspondence with MMT which highlights what all is wrong with MMT. Very poor customer experience. See the conversation below: Booking ID:IN1408B2S188411(DELHI TO MANALI BY VOLVO BUS) 1.On 23/aug/2014 I booked holiday throw make my trip. and I get all counfermations of my trip. and I made payment. after that on 30/08/2014 I get massage from bcf(vendor of make my trip) that my booking of return(MANALI TO DELHI) was canceled due to some reason. after that I contact with MMT. they said to me that yes ur ticket was canceled and we cant do any thing u can arrange your self. I told them that I booked my holiday with u and I want to go for holiday. but MMT'S response was very bad and they don't care after taking money from u. 2.On 31/08/2014 I emailed to make my trip(mmt) about my holiday and request them that if my return ticket was cancelled so make another reservation for me thus I can go for holiday. after that mmt called me and they gave me alternate that sir u can book ticket by ur self and we will make u refund of ur cancelled tickets. but not solving my problem, even they are not ready to listen what i'm trying to say them. 4.  They(mmt) first booked my holiday after that all of my booked ticket is cancelled by very foolish reasons. so this is my experience with make my trip.",1
2508,"My booking IDs are NH710906470570, NH710826470588, NH710886470554, NH710736470610. We, a family group of 10 members booked a hotel at yercaud for Aug-29 long weekend.'Hotel overview"" in makemytrip clearly says the rooms are in the midst of coffee estate. Even the photos in the site showcases the same. We had booked 3 bungalow suites for 2 nights and 1 more bungalow suite for 1 night, so in total 4 suites. In contrast to what is showcased on the website, we were checked in to the rooms in an annexe block which is an apartment type of building consisting of close to 15 rooms. Those were regular hotel rooms, instead of the suites in the coffee plantation. When asked about this at the reception, we were told bungalow suites are only available in the apartment block, not in coffee plantation. Why was that not stated in the hotel description when the photos and overview depicts as if all the room types are in coffee plantation. Infact i'd cancelled another premium hotel booking at Yercaud for the same date just to experience the stay in the middle of greenery with quaint surroundings. On that regards, I feel cheated both by hotel management and makemytrip. Due to my previous bitter and hopeless experience(which I would share shortly) with makemytrip, I didn't call them at the time of checkin. But I called them today after returning from the trip to complain about this issue. The ""i don't care"" attitude response that I get is the moneybackguarantee claim should have been notified within 24 hours of checkout. I just raised the complaint only on second day instead of first day. Come on, I just returned from the trip today, and even today, it took around half an hour waiting on phone to reach a customer care executive. Do you want me to get hanging on phone for half an hour to reach a customer care executive during my vacation to make a call to you instead of enjoying the vacation time with my family. Is that what your policy means? i.e customers to wait depressingly over the phone during vacation instead of doing sight-seeing and other activities. Such a restriction on raising complaint looks totally absurd to me. What difference does it make when a claim is raised within 24 hours of checkout or 48 hours of checkout. Irrespective of the time, the issue remains the same. We were not given the suites that we had booked for. Instead we were cheated by hotel management at the time of checkin and by makemytrip by not taking the complaint within 48 hours of checkout. I didn't pay such premium tariff to stay in regular rooms of the hotel. I expected to be staying in suites in the midst of coffee plantation As I said, i'm going to write another review about the bitter experience that I faced with makemytrip during my kashmir trip. Infact that bitter experience is what made me to not get in touch with makemytrip during hotel checkin = As it doesn't allow me to write another review for the same product, I have to write my next review regd makemytrip w.r.t another booking id IN1204B09347 and IN1204B09068. It was a 6 night Kashmir package including local transport cum hotel stay for 7 adults. During my vacation, I stayed in a houseboat on first night at Srinagar  and I was supposed to reach Gulmarg on second day and stay there at a Gulmarg hotel on second night. But unfortunately due to local strike at Gulmarg, the route to Gulmarg was blocked and I couldn't reach there on second day. Infact the cab driver that makemytrip had arranged refused to take us to gulmarg for second day as per itinerary due to local issue at Gulmarg. Thats where the worst part started. Since we were not able to go to Gulmarg on second day, I was expecting the makemytrip to arrange an alternate accomodation at Srinagar for second night in substitute of gulmarg stay. But they totally forgot my family . They failed to provide an alternate accommodation; instead offered me a refund of 1 night hotel stay amount. How can they expect the guest to arrange an accommodation themselves at the time of crisis that too in a new place. Is that the kind of support they provide while on a tour package. Here again, instead of doing sight seeing at Srinagar, am I supposed to go for hotel hunting at Srinagar. Is that what one is supposed to do during vacation. Makemytrip doesn't have any backup plan for guests during the time of crisis. We are on our own. My travel group had 5 women. If I don't get accommodation for that second night, how do makemytrip expect me to continue with their pre-defined itinerary starting third day. where am I supposed to stay in the new state with my entire travel group. Wouldn't it not jeopardize the whole vacation plan. As I stated earlier, as soon as you make payment, makemytrip doesn't care about guests and they don't support you at all. Then I had to myself go and look out for hotel accomodation for the second night for my entire family which had 5 ladies. That was another frustrating experience with makemytrip. Image the number of calls, that i'd to make to get these things sorted at the time of crisis and don't forget the waiting time each time you call them. It was so frustrating, draining and eventually it completely spoiled my vacation mood after all that mental agony that I had to undergo Secondly, in the package I was told that the Boat house lodging would be at Dal lake. But my entire family was made to stay at Nageen lake which is around 10 kms from Dal lake, so I missed the dal lake view. The Nageen lake was so isolated and I didn't get a feel of staying at Srinagar dal lake boat house. There was not proper communication passed on to the local travel operator at Srinagar. As a part of my package, I was offered Chandawadi-betaab valley excursion at Pahalgam. But the local kashmir   vehicle operator refused that citing that Makemytrip hasn't intimated about that to them. So later I had to call up makemytrip call center and then made them intimate the local vehicle operator. Similar issue happened with my Shikaara ride. As per the package, I was eligible for 1 hour shikaara ride, but again Makemytrip didn't intimate the boat house company regd that, so initially I was refused that complimentary shikaara ride. Then I had to again call up Makemytrip call center and then made them initimate the boat house company. All the hand-offs should have been done by makemytrip without my interference. All these makemytrip people talking to us over phone are just hopeless people without any concern for the customers. All they care about is just getting the customer into buying a deal. thats it. So here I have stated my two bitter experiences with makemytrip.  Hope others benefits from my experience. Their caption is ""Memories unlimited"", not ""unlimited happy memories"". I'm sure they are creating such a lot of bitter memories everywhere.",1
2509,We have booked Hotel Mumtaj Villa at Agra through Make My Trip(MMT). We received confirmation that your 3 rooms are confirmed and no need to contact Hotel or MMT. Once we reached near Hotel then we get to know that Hotel was seized and closed. At last moment in night it was so difficult to find the good Hotel within our budget and finally with my full family we spend very bad night in one of the worst Hotel at Agra. Though we have booked A.C. room but they do not have the Power backup. MMT if your are not sure then pls stop sending confirmation SMS or mail.,1
2510,"Dear All; Please do not do not make booking thru this website, they are day time robbery people and the lazy & worst customer service I ever seen.  Please see my experience for better understanding. I was selected this website because it is INDIAN owned, I have booked my flight for 22nd October 2014 from DXB to MAA & MAA to DXB on 9th, but some reason I want to change the date, so I called customer care they agreed to do so. They asked change of date charges Dhs 300 and at the same time I paid, few housing due case I have requested to change  later I have received the e ticket stating that the return booking is unchanged and remain the same. When I recall the customer care, they asked me to wait for 48 hours promised that my matter will be resolved. I have waited 72 hours and made more than 3 service request thru online but the result is negative. I was totally disappointed then decided to cancel all bookings then they said the penalty will be Dhs 320 which includes non refundable date change fares. I have asked them that more than 3 days you didn't ever changed my date of travel then how you are deducting it from my payment? But they replied as we are under process of changing the date from 3 days why don't you wait another few days? In this fast world it takes seconds to change the travel booking, but the robbers delaying deliberately means ""Delay justice means deny justice"" PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND DONT LOOSE YOUR TEMPER. DO NOT CHOOSE THE DAYLIGHT MAFIA'S.",1
2511,I had made a booking through MMT for  a stay in a hotel in Bangkok for July. I was issued a confirmed booking voucher which even said that there was no need to re-confirm it. It was a sheer coincidence that through some common frineds I found out that the hotel was closed for 6 months for renovation. MMT had no clue about this and their call center was of NIL help. I knew I had to do the leg work myself and contacted the hotel directly and got it from them in writing that it was closed. MMT still took 15 days to verify facts and refund my money. This was so frustrating. Imagine what would have happened had I reachd Bangkok and then discovered this . There was a time when you rocked . that was a time.Book at your own risk people dont fall for their discounts and cheap tricks .,1
2512,"This is in regards to the booking made on the Make My Trip website for my Family. On the 15th AUG 2014 I was making a booking for my family. Since I have recently moved to Bangalore from Chandigarh I wanted my family to come and visit me over in the month in Oct.I wanted to make 3 booking’s for my Father, Mother & Sister since all 3 are living in 3 different parts of the country and we always get together during the Festive season. My Sister Saloni Sondhi from Delhi – Bangalore(Round Trip). - NF2201335348011(Incorrect Booking) & NF2201335348371(Correct Booking) My Mother Neelam Sondhi from Chandigarh – Bangalore(Round Trip). - NF2201335348751 My Father Karan Sondhi from Patna – Bangalore(Round Trip). - NF2201335350967 Now the problem is that I first made the booking for my sister from Delhi to Bangalore(Round Trip), I first attempted to make the booking as following: a.  New Delhi And NCR - Bangalore| Wed, 22 October 14, 09:35 hrs b.  Bangalore - New Delhi And NCR| Tue, 28 October 14, 09:50 hrs While making this booking post putting my Credit Card details the Website returned with an error “Server Error – Booking Canceled” which means that the booking did not go through at around Fri 8/15/2014 10:49 PM, now since this did not go through in the 1st instance so I re-attempted to make the same booking once again. However this time the same return flight was not showing up so I checked for the closest return flight similar to the 1st attempt and I attempted and for the following booking at Fri 8/15/2014 10:53 PM which is exactly 4 mins post my first attempt: c.  New Delhi And NCR - Bangalore| Wed, 22 October 14, 09:35 hrs d.  Bangalore - New Delhi And NCR| Mon, 27 October 14, 22:40 hrs Now this time the same flight returned with the confirmed booking and I was happy to have booked the 1st flight. Post this I also had to make the booking for my Parents for which I did not have any problem. Now while the rest of the 2 booking which were at around: Fri 8/15/2014 10:59 PM: NF2201335348751 Fri 8/15/2014 11:32 PM: NF2201335350967 Post I finished making all the booking I checked my Cellphone and found that the Credit Card was already charged for 4 Booking instead of 3 bookings. And the flight for my sister from Delhi-Bangalore was booked twice. And for the same Passenger Saloni Sondhi I had 2 bookings charged twice respectively: NF2201335348011: Rs 5, 950 NF2201335348371: Rs 5, 052 I immediately called the Make My Trip Telephone Support on 15th AUG 2014 11:45PM which took me 40 mins to connect at midnight, image the aggravation I would have to go through that when the website said that the booking has failed then how did the Credit Card get charged. I spoke to a representative who said that he has made a note of my complaint and gave me my complaint # as 140816-00171 saying that it would take at least 4 working days to revert post getting escalated and since 15th AUG was a Friday the 4 days would start post Monday which meant I had to wait for at least another 7 days to have a revert. Which I agreed to understanding that this is the process and I would follow the protocol. The Agent assured that since the booking is for the same Passenger name and same date of travel thus there should not be any problem and the refund for the NF2201335348011 would go through, and he confirmed that the refund would be 100% since it’s a duplicate booking. I also emphasized saying that I am immediately calling just because I wanted to ensure that this is technical glitch due to which this has happened thus it should not be taking a beating of me. However I received a mail on Thu 8/21/2014 11:17 AM, stating that “Please note that we are looking into this matter and shall revert to you in 3 working days.  We apologize for the inconvenience caused due to delay at our end.” And excitingly I just noted while tying this mail that the complaint # on the mail was different from the one provided to me on the call the other day Ref ID: 140821-010541. Anyways I again gave it time to wait since the agent I spoke to said that any ways the booking is for Oct so there is enough time. I had recently moved to Bangalore and had my self over occupied with settling my house and work. I work with Dell as a Senior Manager with India Technical Support and had been busy with lot of meetings and other work so was unfortunately not able to follow up on the same for quite a few days. Also with the assurance that since this is a Technical Glitch and MMT is a professional organization it would treat the honesty on the situation. I called MMT again on the 28th AUG 2014 4:46PM and spoke to Sumit from your telephone support and it was on my 4th attempt that I was able to reach him after been disconnected by other agents on my previous 3 attempts. Now interestingly I spoke to Sumit and he said that the complaint has been taken however the complaint has not been forwarded to the correct deptt, this came as a big surprise to me that after 13 days of me giving you the time to rectify my problem still the problem is at ground zero. I told him that how can I trust that this time he is going to forward my complain to the correct dept. He was really nice in his comm skills and giving me all the empathy and accountability however when I asked him to  make me speak to his supervisor he denied me from giving the call to the supervisor. However assuring that he will forward my complain to the correct department and he would have a call back arranged for me the same day by the escalating team or his supervisor. Again no call back was received by me. Next Day on the 29th AUG 2014 5:00PM I again called back since I did not receive any call back and again after getting disconnected 3 to 4 times I got connected to Sabita who was generous enough to at least speak to me and listen to my complaint. But again to my surprise she had no information about my complain made on the 15th AUG 2014. We had a conversation for at least 40 mins during which she said to me that my complain cannot be through as I had made a different return ticket. I TRIED TO EXPLAIN AGAIN THAT WHY WOULD I MAKE A BOOKING FOR A SAME PASSANGER “SALONI SONDHI” FOR THE SAME FLIGHT THE SAME DAY, I AM NOT IDIOT THAT I WOULD BOOK 2 TICKETS FOR THE SAME NAME, SHE DOES NOT NEED TWO TICKETS TO TRAVEL IN A SINGLE FLIGHT. When I again requested for a supervisor she said that he would say the same thing to me and trust me it is a very sick and very unprofessional customer service that when a customer is requesting to speak to a senior no one has allowed me to speak to a senior and until now I am not able to give my option to anyone in a higher position. Post this she placed my call on hold saying that she is arranging for a supervisor and after 15 mins of hold the line again gets disconnected and no body call me back. Now this is where the entire conversation got ugly when she started blaming me for the same mistake and accused me to be smart to make a change in the booking, she said that the email was sent before. That is when I really opened my Outlook to check the mail and again found that the mail for the booking that I had first attempted which gave me an error was sent later post the second booking which was successful: E-Ticket & Invoice for your DEL-BLR-DEL trip starting 22 Oct for Booking ID NF2201335348371: Mail received on Fri 8/15/2014 10:55 PM E-Ticket & Invoice for your DEL-BLR-DEL trip starting 22 Oct for Booking ID NF2201335348011: Mail received on Fri 8/15/2014 11:00 PM.(Incorrect booking) I SO MUCH TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO HER THAT MY IF I KNEW THAT THE BOOKING IS THROUGH WHY WOULD I MAKE ANOTHER BOOKING FOR THE SAME PERSON IN THE SAME FLIGHT. BEING HONESTLY SPEAKING THAT WHEN A CUSTOMER IS GENUNILY TRYING TO PUT HIS PRESPECTIVE THE COMPANY CANNOT SIMPY TRY TO BE SMART BY SAYING THAT THE RETURN FLIGHT HAS CHANGED AND NOT AGREE TO WHAT I A FACED AS A PROBLEM. I AM ONCE AGAIN EXPLAINING THAT WHEN I WAS MAKING THE BOOKING I GOT AN ERROR ON THE WEBSITE STATING “Server Error – Booking Canceled” AND THUS I MADE ANOTHER BOOKING AT THAT POINT THE BOOKING WENT THROUGH. CORRECT BOOKING: NF2201335348371: Rs 5, 052 INCORRECT BOOKING: NF2201335348011: Rs 5, 950 I WOULD REQUEST ONCE AGAIN TO KINDLY PROVIDE FULL REFUND FOR THE BOOKING NF2201335348011. If this matter is not sorted I would have to take the pain to have this go the legal way and my lawyer would file a complaint in the consumer court. Kindly Contact me on the following: PH: 9569233770 Email: neel_sondhi@dell.com / er.n.k.sondhi@gmail.com Thanks & Regards, Neel Sondhi Sr. Technical Support Manager Dell| Consumer, Small and Medium Business",1
2513,"If you are planning to book a hotel through makemytrip.com, I would like you to reconsider your decision unless you want to screw your plans.I booked a hotel through this website and planned for a family vacation and received confirmation. On reaching the hotel at holiday destination(OOTY), I came to know that the room that I booked was not available and hotel offered me a inferior room. There was so much rush in OOTY that it was impossible to find another hotel and after travelling for whole night, roaming around in city in search of hotel was out of question.Congrats MMT, you successfully ruined the vacation for my family. Vacation turned into a disaster for me. Cherry on the top was that MMT offered me to refund the difference amount of rooms. Inclusion breakfast was not and amenities also did not match. MMT cant just provide me any hotel/room of their choice and offer the difference that too on reaching the destination.",1
2514,"Perhaps the worst customer service I have come across so far. They are rude and do not provide any assistance correctly only to leave you frustrated at the end of it. Based on my experience, this has been my worst travel experience. Extremely disappointed with makemytrip. Personally, I would never recommend it to anyone. Please refer alternate options",1
2515,"1st deceit: ISSUED TICKET WITHOUT ASKING WHILE THE CUSTOMER EXECUTIVE HIMSELF AND I WERE LOOKING FOR OTHER OPTIONS. Kindly check. 2nd fraud: Not allowing to cancel the fraud ticket. Nothing is mentioned in any of the mails or e tickets issued by you that full payment is to be done to cancel the ticket. And when the issued ticket was issued fraudulently then its out of question of paying extra! A dose of common sense: Can you compel someone to pay the balance amount when he doesn't intend to travel and the paid amount is itself resulting to refund? Does a person who has done so many bookings through your website(check my track record of bookings) and never ever cancelled a single ticket before this would be interested in fighting unnecessarily when come through such a big fraud executive? I shall never ever use your services. Ridiculed and the most frustrating booking experience, rather a worst e commerce fraud experience. He will block or wait list cheaper and better options on phone if you share the flight details. Cancellation possible only before 1 day of travel! Till then you cant travel so your money blocked for buying better ticket. Asking to pay the full amount when you dont want to travel at all instead of giving refund out of the amount already paid. Better fares on other websites.",1
2516,"With more than 40 emails & 2 months waiting for a refund due to MMT not informing me of flight changes for 3 out of 4 flights, resulting in costing me a further $1, 200.00. I am horrified at their attitude and severe lack of communication and customer service. As you will see on many of the responses to complaints on this website, they use automated responses. They don't have one designated person dealing with your complaint . . . my feeling is they try to wear you down so that you give up. Clearly they are pretty good at taking your money, admit to their mistakes then do nothing apart from ""we will get back to you in 24 hours"". You may think that you are saving money which is how I ended up booking them. But in the long run it is a BIG RISK, I would use, cheap flights.com or opodo. I have had good dealing with these in the past, they talk to you on the phone and sort out any issues you have, they care. MMT do not care,  There is nothing more stressful than running around trying to book new tickets when you are at the airport both going & returning from your holiday . . . MMT destroyed ours we were exhausted with stress when we got home, and then with an un planned credit card bill to pay. I am not one for writing complaints however when you have written more than 40 emails and only received automated reply's . . . I feel I need to vent my frustrations and warn others BEWARE . . . its could cost you more than you think! WAKE UP make my trip.",1

He sent me this email on 18/08/2014 04.54 PM and made me make a payment of 10, 000 at 6:15 when I was on my way to Work and I was on the phone with him and my fiancee all this while and there was no way for me to know that he has sent me an email When I asked him to change the package he said he cannot do that so I asked him to refund the money  he said he cannot do that either. so on 22 August 2014 07:50 AM I sent an email to what he claims is his manager: Dear sir, My original plan was 19 20 Cochin 21 22 munnar and 23 alleppey I have been given 19 Cochin 20 21 munnar 22 alleppey and 23 again cochin If you check my chat with Aurbind I had very specifically asked for saj earth resort in Cochin and abad copper castle in munnar You don't have a tie up with abad copper castle so you offered me misty mountain I can understand. It will take 5 hours from allepey to cochin so I was offered first and last night in cochin instead of first 2 nights so that I don't miss my flight I can understand that But then I have 19 in saj earth resort and 23 in quality hotel in cochin This was never discussed and this is not the ittenery that I had accepted before making the payment Why do I have 2 different hotels in the same city when I had specificaly  asked for Saj earth resort?  you have never mentioned the name of quality hotel to me. Yes you had sent me an email but what we agreed upon on the phone was totally different from what you made me pay for. If you listen to my calls with aurbind and read the email he sent me you will know that I was actually promised saj earth resort for the first 2 nights till 15 minutes before I made the payment. Sir, I trusted Aurbind like a dear friend and I have referred him to my best friend and my one and only brother-in-law for their honeymoon package he is more than customer care agent to me but now I feel he has cheated me.

2518,"I had taken a holiday package to Sri Lanka through make my trip and my worst fears came true. It was the most disorganized tour management ever and the driver and guide cheated us on every single chance they could. Openly taking cuts from shops and small time vendors where we shopped. Taking long routes and avoiding major highways. making us pay tolls and Verbal abuses. that was the last straw. The driver cum guide had no idea about any tourist sites. Sub standard hotels were provided which located far off. had to call make trip several times on the tour, send emails etc. had to pay a huge mobile bill. Thanx to make my trip. Its been several weeks no one has even replied from their costumer care cell. One thing is sure I AM NEVER USING MAKE MY TRIP AGAIN",1
2519,"I want to share a recent correspondence with MMT which highlights what all is wrong with MMT. Very poor customer experience. See the conversation below: Booking ID: IN1406B0S196780 I wish to draw your attention to many deficiencies in service by your company in respect of the above tour. 1) Your sales staff is least interested in servicing paying customers once the payment is made. They simply toss matters to the backoffice team and take no ownership for sorting out issues. The sales person was very rude and condescending – almost making us feel that she was doing a favour to us. 2) I had to send several reminders to your backoffice team for issuing the tour and train vouchers. Your person had falsely stated that the vouchers were sent by courier including providing me with a fake consignment number of Blue Dart, two days before commencement of the trip( I can share all mail correspondence/SMS if required). After repeated follow-ups the tickets were sent by air cargo( I had to spend Rs 3000 towards petrol, warehousing charges and toll) to pick up the Euro Rail vouchers. The mental agony and torture suffered by us a day before the journey is not something that we will ever wish. 3) Despite three reminders that we need vegetarian meals, this was not updated to the airline. Last night, while traveling from Venice to Dubai, no meals were provided as your company failed to inform the airline that we need veg meals. This is simply unacceptable. Going hungry for 8 hours – all because your team goofed up. 4) The hotel provided in Florence was seedy and in a very bad locality. The room was small and broken down – which is unacceptable when three ladies are traveling. 5) We have been your regular customers in the past – we will never use MakemyTrip again for any of our vacations. Your team is not simply interested in servicing customers.",1
2520,"I recently experienced that, MAKEMYTRIP is worst travel site to book air tickets. Very Recently while booking the tickets my wife by mistake swapped the boarding ports. For this mistake I need to cancel the complete booking and I got peanuts in return. I tried everything from calling Makemytrip CC to Jet Airways and finally on my request Jet Airways second support level team informed me that this is a complete blunder from makemytrip team. Therefore, I humbly request all the mates reading this article, please don't get attracted to foolish offers provided by makemytrip team they are all only eye catching offers. Please don't expect any kind of support from makemytrip Customer care team and don't get trapped. I request you to share this article/incidence with all your friends and family and make them aware about them. Many thanks for your time and patience to read this article.",1
2521,"I tried to book a Rail Ticket with'Make My Trip', Everything was fine uptil; the payment page. Once the payment has done, it redirected to Error page. Amount got deducted but Ticket not booked at all. I contacted MMT and opened a ticket for refund(8/8/14). But till now(20/8/14) I have not received my Refund and not even a single reply from'MMT' . I am not happy with the support. Its very irritating, even if we keep on messaging them on their website, no reply from them. I have also Escalated to Management but still the same. Worst customer service.",1
2522,"We booked a hotel - Palmshore Beach Resort, through makemytrip at Kannur (Cannanore) in the last week of July 2014. 5 rooms for 5 couples. Got confirmation from makemytrip. Confirmed the booking by calling the hotel. On the day of travel, 15th August 2014, night at 9:30 pm when we reach Kannur and call the hotel, they refuse booking and even refuse to give the direction to the hotel. We called makemytrip for help. Instead of giving solution, they kept us on hold and kept on calling GOD KNOWS WHOM! Spent the night on Road. A kind hotel manager in a different hotel gave us a us a service room for the 5 ladies in the group to save their souls and a toilet for our relief.",1
2523,"Had great respect for makemytrip.com  but this time they tried to cheat me.This is related to booking id NH210643826107 .I had booked   a cottage though your makemytrip site at  ""Shakti Resort, BEHROR, 133rd Milestone, (NH8), NH8 Behror, India"" .The booking was for 15 -17 august, 2014. Unfortunately the hotel ""Shakti Resort"" was unable to provide me the cottage  and makemytrip could not provide me any alternative accommodation as well. This resulted huge inconvenience for my family which includes a 2 year old baby. No only our family outing got spoiled  but we were left starved  and finally had to return back to our home  since we could not arrange any other accommodation. The most disappointing fact is makemytrip sent me the email/sms as well as a hotel voucher saying ""Kindly note that your booking is confirmed and you are not required to contact hotel or MakeMyTrip.com to reconfirm the same"". So, I did not call the hotel for confirmation and headed for the resort. And  when I reached the hotel(  5 hours after booking) I got a call from MakeMyTrip that my booking is not confirmed and they can not help me to find any other accommodation. This is ridiculous . you send a confirmation voucher and then  notify that booking is not confirmed. I can understand if the notification comes within hours. But, it came after  5 hours. when I am already on my way to the hotel.  This is totally unacceptable. There is one more twist in the whole incident. When I was forcing the hotel guys to honor the voucher, they offered me a cheap executive room(5, 642)  at same price of cottage(11, 285) . they would not refund the extra amount I paid for the cottage. And makemytrip guys just asked me to obey them. Is not it a case of cheating? So please refund my whole amount. Also, let me know if you will compensate for the agony I went through.",1
2524,I traveled to Hyderabad from Mumbai very frequently. Makemytrip made my traveling very easy and website is very good it is like my traveling organizer. Few times I used free coupons which I got benefits of 2000 INR. It provides international hotel booking also along with coupons. In tough times of irctc website makemy trip helped me a lot. Even now I book rail ticked from makemy trip.,5
2525,"I had tried to book tickets from cochin to pune and was declined 4 times showing error that they could not communicate with my bank and the prices were higher to each time I would try again. Frustrated I decided not to make any bookings only to realize after a few hours that I had confirmed tickets without my approval and money taken from my account. I have been calling the US and Indian call centers but either they say technical glitch.call after 4 hours or keep transferring, and not one agent has been able to offer any resolution.  Customer service is really horrible.  Moreover,  I don't understand why I am going through this inconvenience for the sole fault of trying to book through makemytrip.com",1
2526,"I was made a fool when I took interest into Makemytrip Rewards program wherein you have to book your holidays/hotel and flights to become the Gold /Platinum member of Makemytrip. They lure you by showing attracting offers of free holiday /hotel vouchers and free nights stay when you spend lakhs of rupees to become thier member. I did the same thing and booked over priced holidays and hotels at makemytrip.com. So I became their platinum member. Now the real thing started when I asked for  the benefits like free vouchers. After fighting with them for continuously 1 month over phone and emails I was offered some vouchers of holidays and hotels . When I checked these vouchers I was surprised again . All vouchers have been set very High spending limit of Rs. 50000 or Rs 1 lakh to get just merely benefit of Rs 2000. To summarize you already spent lakhs of rupees to become their Gold/platinum member now you have spend again high money to get those benefits. But in their Rewards programs it was no where mentioned that to get the Vouchers you again need to spend high limit of money. I had done 4 Holiday Package booking with you this year 2014. Those 4 Booking IDs are IN1402B5S161679/IN1402B5S161792/NL2081129189/NL2081129191. I raised complain with your Rewards team for getting the loyalty benefits of Hotel & Holiday stay vouchers. The complain number is:-The Reference ID 140701-025735 .I followed this complain for longer than a month . But after all my efforts I received the vouchers which were set high transaction limit . To use those vouchers I have to again spend thousands of money and it gives me barely a 5 to 15% OFF on bookings made. Right now including MMT other travels like yatra, goibio are already running hotel & holiday discounts ranging from 15% to 50%. Then whats the point of running your FAKE REWARDS PROGRAME where in you lure customers to provide free stay vouchers . But in actual that's your marketing strategy that customer again has to spend a lot of money to redeem your vouchers. Vouchers should not have any minimum high spending limit. I did received many vouches from Flipkart, Bookmyshow which are directly redeemable . If to use Rs.2000 Holiday voucher I have to spend Rs 50000 to Rs1 lakh rupees money then its simply the cheating nothing else. I would urge other customer to become aware of such fraud marketing techniques like Makemytrip is doing .",1
2527,"This is suresh and my booking id is IN1408B2S010882, make my trip guys recovered the money from the amount I paid for my travel for some historical issues with Holidays Inn Wayanad Resort, and I have been tortured by the hotel everyday that my booking not confirmed so please do not travel, if you travel then we will make you stand outside etc. . But make my trip guys says that your booking is confirmed. I've planned to travel with my family where 5 year old kid is there and 2 other friends family, the whole trip was collapsed just because of the trouble these guys made, . its been more than 15 days, . they are not arranging for any alternate and they are least bothered about to resolve this issue, . Did any once taken this legally, give me contacts, . I don't want to leave this simple. Not just because of few thousands, its a threat from both the parties, especially when you plan a travel with family. The way I have been treated and they completely ruined my purpose the family trip. Now I have ended up trashing my other travel arrangements to Wayanad and to ooty as well which was planned on the next days.Its beyond the service. They  tortured me for more than 15 days. I am looking like a fool in front of my family and friends. by choosing make my trip. If you want to have pleasant experience, dont opt for them. Regards Suresh Kumaresan",1
2528,Pls. dont go for hotel+ Flight booking.They are big cheaters. The price shown on website is just to attract people and when you waste time searching the best deal and go to make payment price shown is as upgraded. The combos are listed to fool people by showing heavy discount and they actually charge more. You will never be able to get in touch with customer service people and they are just not bothered about your concerns.,1
2529,"I had handed over the customer feedback form to the tour guide on 22nd May and was expecting some response from MMT, but I am yet to hear from them. So let me share a detailed feedback regarding our European Summer Dream tour experience.We had a mixed bag of good and bad experiences Good experiences :- a) Patient Customer service representative Jaffer , who guided us through the initial booking process b) Small group of 21 , which was the perfect size and hence the travel in the coach throughout was also comfortable. c) Food was good and edible at all locations ..no hassles. However the dinner seemed repetitive , same menu atleast for the first 4 nights. d) Accomodation was clean & neat at all locations , perfect for the time spent at those locations. e) Cost was reasonable as compared to other tour operators. Bad experiences :- a) Information regarding the things to carry on the trip was shared only 2 days before the travel, which left us with no time to prepare. For the Lido show the requirement was for formal apparels . You cannot expect senior citizens and house wives to have these clothes handy. b) Guidance for some off -the- shelf medicines was provided by other travel agencies.Nothing of that sort was shared with us. c) Despite several requests, flight and accomodation details were not shared until last 2 days before the travel. Though the visa was applied only 3 weeks before the travel , our passports were held by them 2 months in advance under the pressure that we may not get our visas in time to travel . Due to which I had to cancel my official travels. d) Our paris stay in short was a disaster, thanks to the incompetent guide on board. To start with, when the flights landed there was electricity problem at the airport and we were delayed by 2 hrs reaching the hotel.The travellers were all still enthusiastic and prepared for sightseeing. However the guide called it a day and asked us to rest. The next day plan for Disney land was cancelled to make up for the previous day activity. We still were not able to attend Lido show. The entire Paris tour was done only on bus.The guide was not even sure whether Louvre musuem was opened on Wednesdays or not and only at 3 pm after reaching Louvre , he said that we could take a tour of the musuem . We hardly had 2 / 3 hrs to see the musuem. To add to that he did not even inform us that the kids could visit the musuem for free . We ended up paying for the kids only to find out about it later. After the Paris experience , the members in the group started tracking the itinerary like a hawk because we could not trust the guide anymore. e) Our guide gave us guidance only about the rest rooms and whether it was paid or free . Other than that we were on our own at all the locations trying to find out the activities to do in the limited time we had. Because of which we missed out on some stuff like the snow games on Mt Titlis. f) On the Jungfrauch trip during our travel on the cog wheel train , one of the members of our group a senior lady was left out on one of the stations she had got down to take pictures . The guide did not realise till we reached the last stop. This lady panicked , yet she managed to take the next train and reach the last stop. Due to a panic attack she even collapsed.Due to this experience she did not join us on the MT Titlis tour the next day. Would I take a chance to send senior citizens in my family relying on MMT's guide in the future , I don't think so.",2
2530,"Kathmandu-pokhara .It was 5 days and 4 nights trip. once the booking was done except for mailing vouchers and air tickets there was no form of communication from make my trip. We had nightmare in the middle of the trip due to vehicle breaking down and the 3rd party fail 2 arrange another vehicle on time-due 2 this half a day of our vacation was ruined.we were given incomplete information regarding adventure sports bookings when we landed there, there were no vacancies in paragliding in pokhara and we were greatly disappointed', even we had no information about the rafting on the way to Pokhara. So my kind suggestion to the readers is, Nepal is a friendly country and its easy for Indians to explore with little bit of research before you plan and as well save money. Overall it was a worst experience,",1
2531,"If your trip plans are not 100% sure, then don't book through  makemytrip. The Sales representative would be very nice to you till you pay initial deposit amount. Later it will be big torture to get updates or reschedule. I booked Maldives Honeymoon trip through makeMaytrip for 4 days for Rs 1.4lacs. Later due to unforeseen reasons I needed to reduce it to 3 days. When I requested the same, then these people said I need to pay extra amount Rs 15 k. But I was able to see reduction in air fares and same resort fee and able to book both flights and resort in less than Rs 1 lac. As I was able to find less price, I requested them to cancel my booking 2 months in advance. Here actual problem started, they are reluctant to pay my money back by giving all sorts of funny reasons. Their website says it is Rs 30k deposit but they collected Rs 40 k while booking and were hesitant to pay any money back. Then I need to say them that the website says Rs30 k and I need approach consumer forum. Then the returned Rs 10k but I lost my Rs 30 K(Rs 30, 000) and valuable time. So please avoid this service if you can. If get calls from Naina etc., definitely you can avoid it. If it is Maldives, with my experience you can book flight tickets and resorts on your own or other best service companies. But don't go through make my trip if there are plans of slight plan change. As they are hesitant to accept any change requests.",1
2532,"Never ever book your holiday/vacation/honeymoon trip with MakemyTrip . Their service is the worst of the lot . Your whole trip will be spoiled . In my case when I reached my destination, I had to wait for 3 hours for a cab to get to my hotel, when I reached my hotel I was informed that no rooms were booked in my name! And guess what it was an international holiday trip! I had to make repeated calls to the customer care, their response was discourteous and thoroughly unhelpful! As far as booking tickets for flights are concerned, their cancellation/refund policy is a TOTAL FRAUD! I was completely cheated . The customer care told me that it would be refunded back in my account or I would get it in the form of store credit within 24 or 48 hours! guess what I got a call 2 days later saying that ""im sorry mam its not our fault we cannot refund your money! . There is some system/software  error is their website so be very careful when you choose dates while booking a flight . You might have selected as 3rd of July but when you get the tickets you'll see that its 4th of July! and then you'll have to make repeated calls to customer care(which they'll pick up after putting your call on hold for 5 minutes) . and then they wont even refund your money or change the dates or accept their system error fault! Instead they will charge you 2000 or 3000 or whatever amount as penalty! BEWARE OF THIS HUGE SCAM THIS COMPANY IS RUNNING! I AM TAKING THEM TO CONSUMER COURT!",1
2533,"Please don't use MakeMyTrip,  use any other e.g. Yatra, agoda.com etc.I booked higher category room in Hotel from MakeMyTrip. Hotel they provided was of lower category. Then I booked a complain against MakeMyTrip. I realized that it is very hard to get the complain resolution from MakeMyTrip. MakeMyTrip's escalation is very bad. Their customer care executives don't know how to deal with the clients. I'll never use MakeMyTrip again.",1
2534,"I am disillusioned and disgusted by the service provided to me my makemytrip and underhand tactics used by them to sell tickets to customers. TWICE! not just once.Always been conned by them! 1)  Asked to pay Extra money for insurance just 24 hours prior to the flight: In the first booking they provided incomplete information and sold me travel insurance at Rs 3500/-( which I bought along with my mother in law's ticket a few weeks before departure), only to ring me 24 hours prior to departure asking me to pay additional  6500/- or I could cancel and start looking for another insurance at such short notice - not to mention about complicated refund process with them, which can take months as per our previous experience with them. 2)  booking  for today for my mother: Connecting flight booked on the wrong dates leaving passenger in Lurch! I had a long written chat, on line, with agent about booking a ticket for my mother on 19/07/2014 from New Delhi to Brisbane with a shortest possible stop over. I have photographic proof that I confirmed the dates, a number of times, during the booking, that the Quanta’s flight 19/07/2014 from new Delhi to Brisbane had 2 hours 50 minutes connection time in Singapore. It was confirmed by agent again when he sent me the payment link Reassured by the recurrent confirmations by yourself, I happen not to dwell on the traveling date of the connecting flight on the E-Ticket. I had paid a good premium for getting a ticket with shortest possible transit time, so as to make sure that my mother who - 1)  Suffers with arthritis and has a wheel chair request 2)  Has limited English 3)  Traveling for the first time on a long haul international flight 4)  Not very familiar with the complex foreign country airport and immigration procedures Therefore, it was astonishing and shocking for her, myself and my entire family to be told by the airport officials that the connection time at Singapore airport would now be 27 hours! So, my mother, who is at present on her flight to Singapore, has been left in Lurch with no airport hotel booking, no transit visa, minimal foreign currency- all because of either an unacceptable error or cheating on the agents part, to sell  ‘a’ ticket to a customer. I was promised a call back in 4 hours when I called hem today but past 4 hours - no one has called! MOST UNPROFESSIONAL SITE < DON'T GET LURED BY THE LOW TICKET PRICE!",1
2535,"I would like to pen down our experience we have with MMT starting from the first day to the end of trip. My Parents, along with one more couple(total 4 person), traveled to Europe on 17th June 2014. During the entire process we got in touch with multiple people from MMT starting with sales people. Sorry to say this but our experience with MMT sales was exceptional. Exceptional is sense that sales people left no stone unturned to make this sale happen and make our life difficult. Right from the first day, after we made the initial payment, things started falling through cracks. There were bunch of lies at every stage and at every question of ours, be it regarding MMT refund policy, visa application process days, visa application papers and other minor details of trips(I have torrent of examples). Above all, its unresponsiveness which took the hell out of us. I have all the email and SMSes which shows that every time we had to follow-up with MMT for updates and information; however this should have been other way round. When I complained, we were told that there lot of transactions happening and people are busy, so it’s not possible for team to respond to all emails. Seriously? This is one of the most absurd and insane reason one can ever give for being ignorant in service industry. We understand there are a few things which are being “said-but-not-done” during sales stage, but with MMT this is way too much. Biggest miscommunication happened when we were communicated by sales team that visa will take around a week for processing. Then we were handed over to operations team which was way better than sales team. But they have their own set of issues. As per them, it was all miscommunication by sales team which caused the entire problem and somehow we found this to be true. We encountered many situations where things which were promised by sales team, was not actually part of tour, and when we/operations team asked sales team, she just turned hostile like a witness of Salman Khan's case do:) . She just claimed that I never said or promised this. I wish we would have recording of all the conversation we had with sales team. Last thing that add insult to the injury is, just a couple of days before the travel date(when operations team realized that visa could be a problem due to time), they started building up the negativity by sending the cancellation policies saying visa typically need minimum 15 working days for processing from application date and if visa is not granted, MMT won't be responsible for this. You can’t expect this just a few days before your travel. Sheer non-sense! My question is when you knew that visa typically takes 15 working days, why did sales team suggested us 17th date of travel when we were open to travel at later dates. But then, by God grace, visa was granted and it seems operations team did some real hard work to sort this out in the end. They also managed to get us a few things which are generally not part of packaged but promised by sales team. Having said all that, the rock-star of the whole story is Tour Manager. He healed all the wounds, with his service. We were very worried after our initial experience with MMT, but then we were surprised by the way tour was managed tour mangager. He made sure that passengers were well informed about everything and also offered his help wherever and whenever needed. The overall experiences of the passengers were great and they didn't face any sort problem during the entire trip.  Many people are now asking me how you arranged the trip and I am very skeptical to refer MMT, but if I would take MMT name, it would be just because of tour manager. All said and done, though I am not sure if this email will be taken seriously or even put into the consideration, but MMT seriously need to think about their sales team, they might be meeting their monetary targets, but doing this at the cost of harassing customer is not ethical. Lastly, we had word with operation teams to offer some sort of discount to us for all the harassment we faced during the initial stages but he looked like a basket case. Also, sales team promised us for MMT coupons and, no surprise, she is not again responding, it’s like beating a dead horse. 10/10 to tour manager for great great management, and big thumbs down, for the sales team for all the misguidance, misinformation and unresponsiveness.",2
2536,"I will advise anyone booking flights on make my trip to confirm with the parent airline whether the flight you are booking actually exists or not.My first international trip from India to Bali was completely ruined thanks to make my trip. I booked tickets from India to Singapore and from Singapore to Bali 3 months in advance. The flight from Singapore to Bali was in Tiger Mandala airways.The airways went out of business about a month before our trip and the website failed to inform us about the same. After reaching Singapore we had to make our own arrangements for both the onward and return journey.

2537,"My wife made the mistake of deciding to buy a Ladakh Deluxe package at an exorbitant price. All they did was book us in a 2nd grade hotel and provide a car for 4 of the 7 days package. There was no guide provided, the driver was a lout and knew hardly any local places wells, the tour manager didn’t know the difference between Ladakh and leg and the hotel food provided was same oily, Indian fare which was boring and not nice to the stomach. They didn’t even provide any tea or water in the rooms and we were forced to buy these at exorbitant costs. It was not easy to contact their representatives at all and even if they could be caught, they would make no effort to keep any of our requests and all we heard was, ‘no this can’t be done, no that can’t be done, we apologies, we are sorry’! We paid Rs. 41000 for 7days. For the crapy services, the 2nd rated of hotels, the shared car provided, zero service or anything else, it would have cost no more than Rs. 15000/person. They made a hefty profit. The profited from our mistake and we will not make this mistake again, not at least with Make my trip. So, we didn’t need these cheap, fly by night operators to book a hotel and car for us. We could do it directly at the hotel and there are plenty of operators who will rent cars at fraction of a cost. What appalled us was their scant regard for our safety. We had to go to Nubra valley which requires us to pass through Khardung la pass at 18000 ft. The road is hazardous to say they least. The road is narrow, curvy and prone to landslide and full of holes. Yet, the driver was sent to pick up someone else at 4am and then he came to take us to Nubra valley which takes about 6hrs. he frequently fell as asleep and we had to ask him to stop and have some tea or something to keep him awake. This is the safety standard of Make My trip and this is how much these shoddy guys care for customers on whose money they live. Make My trip is the new age net dalal, masquerading as modern efficient consumer oriented business. They will not survive for long given how they are cheating and letting down customers like us. I will not touch them with a barge pole and they have earned lot of our bad will. I would have been better of by booking a hotel and the car for the tours separately. I would have got a far better travel experience at at least half the costs. I will not recommend it for anyone.",1
2538,"I have booked a hotel through Make my trip agent(the guy forced us to book it from him and did not give us a moment to think over it). I was assured that even he is booking a ticket, I can still get the 10% cash back offer if I am making a payment on MMT site using my bank account's card on which the offer was applicable. So he gave me the booking id and I made the payment on their website. To my surprise after making payment through their site and waiting for a month I did not receive the cash back. After inquiry I came to know that the discount is not applicable if the booking is done by their agent(even though I paid from their website and entered the promo code in the box). Guys please don't trust MMT agents as they are either not fully trained and have half knowledge about their own site or they are just concerned with their commission irrespective of customers loss. Another thing which I don't like about MMT and is most frustrating is in case of queries/inquiries on phone they make you wait for at least 15-20 minutes before resolving your issue.",1
2539,"Makemytrip are cheaters. I planned a last minute trip for the next day through makemytrip. They took the money and booked the hotel giving confirmation. 5 hours later after, they come back and say, hotel not available. Why the hell you booked and wasted my time, I would have bought it directly.Then coming back, they say we will upgrade to a better hotel which they never do and then offer a cheap hotel Never fall for discount offers from makemytrip.If you planning a last minute trip, book directly through hotel because these guys have no clue",1
2540,"The first thing I would say about my ladakh trip is that it was awesome, marvelous, fantastic journey.I can't express myself how happy I am.Whatever I say  will be very less.Their whole arrangement was superb. Hotel in Leh, I think is one of the best hotel in Leh and stay at nubra valley and pangong lake in tent it was once in a life time experience.Foods was of the best quality.They really made our journey memorable.Not only me, the whole group was very very happy.I talked to everyone, the tour manager  was really a gentleman.Hats off to him all the credits goes to makemytrip team for giving this opportunity to explore ladakh. Make My Trip Rocks.Carry on.",5
2541,"We survived a severe nightmare!Our trip to Malaysia and Singapore is the most horrible holiday experiences I had. Incorrect Visa: It all started from Visa stamping, Photos of my two kids were interchanged on the Malaysia Visa. As it was just 2 days left for the trip, we were forced to bring the passports to the Malaysian VFS at Nehru Place to get it corrected. We had to take time off from our office at such a short notice. At the end we could get the passports with correct visa stamps just 1.5 hours before we were to start for the airport. We were actually in an anxious and painful state of mind till the last minute whether we will be able to go for the trip or not. Pickup from Malaysia Airport to Hotel: At the Malaysia arrivals no one from MakeMyTrip was there to receive us, we did not had any local phone to make calls. We had to borrow phone to call their local Manager number, after multiple follow-up calls we could meet their local representative, but she was unable to provide reasonable explanation for delay, in spite of having confirmed booking message in her hand held device already. Eventually after some serious struggle, cab was provided to us but this could only happen after 2-3 hours of delay. In this whole event we were left stranded, and the place where we were asked to wait, did not even had a single seat to sit on. Early Check-In at Malaysia Hotel: Initially when tentative itinerary was proposed, we did notice check-In time at Malaysia Hotel to be 14:00 hrs, we had a chat with MMT executive and explained her about us being a family and the requirement for early check-In. I was verbally assured on phone that this will be done, but after receipt of vouchers we realized this was not taken care. On further enquiry we were told it is left to the room’s availability at the Hotel and its discretion. If this had been explained earlier to us, we could have paid for another half a day hotel bookings. Because even we were ready to pay at Malaysia(KL), but the rooms availability was not there, as a result we had to spend about 2hrs in the hotel lobby with painful faces of our kids and family, which was stressed after almost 15hrs of the start of our journey. Genting Vouchers: We had a Genting Highlands tour included in our package but the vouchers were not provided to us. Even here we had to do multiple follow-ups for the vouchers, later we were told we need to contact Mr. Siddhartha at Genting for the vouchers. It took significant time to locate Siddhartha and as he was busy with other guests we had to wait for more than 2 hrs to claim our vouchers. In the whole sequence of event we lost almost 2-3 hrs of our precious time, with our family and kids waiting in frustration. 5. Kuala Lumpur to Singapore Transfer Coach: Again we were not given out tickets for Kuala Lumpur to Singapore Bus and were dropped at wrong bus-stand by their cab driver. After waiting 2 hrs and some rigorous follow-ups and strong reaction from our side were we arranged a bus to Singapore. So again we were clue less for nearly 2 hours and had to undergo some serious stress. But that was not the end of our agony. Singapore Bus-station pickup: When we reached Singapore, again there was no-one there to pick us. We waited for almost 2 hrs and finally had to shell out SGD 19.80 for taxi from our pocket to reach hotel. So even this time we were left on the roads for~2 hrs with tired and hungry faces of kids and family. Singapore Half-day City tour:- We were two families travelling together. On the receipt of vouchers we noticed that two families were given separate timing slots for Singapore city tour. We immediately brought this in notice of the MMT executive and were told that this has been taken care. We However on reaching Singapore we came to know we were assigned different timing slots for our families, and on request to give the same slot were told that there was no vacancy for the morning day slot that day(Thursday). We had to struggle with the local operator at Singapore to get it done but this ONLY became possible for Friday and not on Thursday. So you see we could get the slot corrected at the cost of our half day i.e. Thursday, our entire schedule for this day got messed up. We had our tickets booked for June 6th(Friday) for Universal Studios. So we could spend only half day there and almost half of our money(SGD 552) got wasted. I think these are enough evidences to explain the trauma, agony and financial losses that we have incurred during the entire trip.",1
2542,Worst Experience with MakyMyTrip. I never recommend this to anyone. We booked fr international trip. we had a worst experience. Because of their worst service they asked us to pay 50k extra amount. Inspite of many calls n emails they didn't respond and finally asking us to pay the 50k extra amount for the date change. They asked us to submit the docs for some date in jun. we did the same 1 week late. after few days on receiving the docs they called us and told that there is no sufficient time so u have to change the date and pay 50 k extra for the same.is it not their duty to tell us the deadline for submitting? Is it not their duty to tell the prons and cons fr not submitting the docs? Is it not their duty to follow up?AC buses fr which we pay 500INR vl call us before the bus leave.we are paying lakhs and these people are responding this way.Since they had the amount they r playing like this.Just asked us to submit the docs for which they didn't even give the address.after 2-3 calls they responded with the address. Even after so much of argument they didn't even reduce the amount. Worst Service!,1
2543,"I took European bonanza package which and departured on 17-06-2014.Booked by kashayp dhanak at Ahemdabad. No star hotel provided was provided, half of the tour was from the bus. Worst food! Wrong information was given. We saw the Colosseum, from out side only at 100 mts distance I chose jain food but they made me eat non vegetarian food.  tThen said they were sorry and it was hotel's staff mistake. They didnt even provide water in the bus.Horrible experience. Never going to recommend it to anyone.",1
2544,"I have been facing a number of issues with MMT. MMT has worst processes ever. Every time I need to explain the problem to them and no satisfactory response even after writing mails/service requests escalated to highest level/talking to customer care multiple times.Already wasted lot of time on mmt.In plain words they just dont care about customer. Just one example:Even on missing the flight [with whatever 100-150 is being returned by airline they are charging 250 even on that making my balance in negative.Doesn't sound logical to me], the issue list is long, wont waste more time/energy Piece of advice:Its much wiser to book tickets directly from the airline/directly contact hotels!",1
2545,"Bogus offers: Refer to my complaint- 140622-023539. Please do not believe in makemytrip. They simply cheat with no response. The call center is useless and they simply buy 24 hour time for everything. In my case, the escalation process in website is truly a non-sense. I don't know how they survive in this biz with such cheating offers. They mentioned 2 meal plan and the hotel charged the dinner. The customer like me is left in lurch for last one week without any response. Thumbs down makemytrip.I will never buy anything from you. Cleartrip, Yatra, Travelguru are far better, they show what you get and maintain promises! I strongly recommend to everyone not to choose makemytrip!",3
2546,"Attention was given only till booking. I have requested for something 1 month ago. Till now, I was never answered. I get replies from customer care which is never clear. Without solving the issue, they will simply close the tickets. After booking is done, they will never care. Extremely worst customer service. I have sent so many emails about the issue for past 1 month. No clear response and never taken care. I would suggest you to go for some other good booking agencies which provide good customer support. Better avoid makemytrip.",1
2547,"I booked the Amazing Ladakh package through Make My Trip and this trip turned out to be horrible in terms of service extended by MMT service personnel. While booking we were informed that we are entitled to one bottle water everyday which we dint get for first two days. Then after arguing with the local rep he connected us to the tour manager who was never present during our excursions and neither did he introduce himself on the first day. After explaining him the story he said he knew about this issue as our reservation person Sulaksha from MMT had notified him but he did not give us water bottles because she had not mailed him. This is purely lack of communication. When we went to visit Hall of Fame, the person at the ticket counter did not have any tickets for MMT group and he refused to give us tickets without paying saying that he has been cheated by MMT before. We bought the tickets and only after pleading for 4-5 times did we get our refund. Lastly, we were traveling from Mumbai and our entire trip package was booked by the MMT agent Sulaksha . We did not get our return ticket from Leh to Delhi till the last evening. The flight was delayed by Jet to 9:40 am and our flight from Delhi to Mumbai was at 10:45 am which we were surely going to miss. I understand flight delays are common but MMT washed their hands off trying to help us reschedule our flight. The hotel owner was kind enough to let me use his phone and laptop to alter my bookings but the tour manager said very bluntly nothing could be done and we would have to make fresh bookings at our own expense. He took no responsibility even though the entire trip and flight was booked through Make My Trip. I could not reschedule flights online because it was booked through MMT but they refused to reschedule our flight and asked us to do it ourselves. The hotel owner provided me with Go Air customer care number and let me use his phone for this entire process at 11pm in the night. I will never forget this dreadful experience and the complete lack of empathy and hospitality by Make My Trip. Nikita nabh",2
2548,"WHY DEAR MOUTHSHUT YOU SHOW ONLY POSITIVE REVIEWS IN MMT?! THEY AREN'T THE LATEST MSGS. SOMETHING SMELLS FISHY. Standing in the immigration queue in Bangkok Airport I saw an Indian guy from my flight and he had a ticket from MMT.then I said to myself I had to do something, I have to alert everyone coz these cheaters are so popular n I dont want anyone having such a bad experience like me.so pls read n never buy a ticket from them again!Used to love their website but now they have become so famous they just want to rip u off from every possible angle.Booked  a ticket Goa-Mumbai as a domestic flight for our Bangkok Airways, Mumbai-Bangkok-Chiangmai ticket with my husband and child. Don't know why I chose for the 1st time the flight-hotel combo, silly me even if I saw that they were lying, saying I was saving so much money coz flight-hotel seperately would cost me 25k and now I was paying 11k for both!But I made my little research b4 & I knew that 3 flights were 9k and hotel was 2.500! so basically the discount was 500 rs. But four days b4 the flight we had to change the dates(for 2 days later from the original booking)called Bangkok airways n they said no charges 4 both international flights.Called MMT and.because the hotel doesn't want to make a change  we will have to make a FULL cancellation! I didn't want to cancel I think its common to postpone a trip? so here started the insanity. I was told that out of the 11k I could get: according to the 1st agent: 4500 back , according to the 2nd agent 2 hrs later 3100 and the last told me. 2700!All without anything changing, the hotel was fully cancelled! I only saw uneducated stuff like that in Airtel. Everyother company like eg Tatasky, Snapdeal etc the operators I spoke to them, they were assertive, knowing their jobs and knowing how to use the calculator. when I angrily asked the last guy why the price keeps on shrinking, he replied, ""Each person's flight cancellation cost is 1500 but the 4 year old child pays 2500."" WTF? A CHILD PAYS MORE?SINCE WHEN? they've lost their mind. to this he said that the airline policy is so, I can check with them.I was sure he was lying so I did. Spicejet told me that a child pays1500 rs as well. lying cheating scammers! I called and called them and somehow when b4 I was getting someone after 30 sec now I was calling and go on hold till I hung up. sure they screen the phones. BIG shame on you MMT! from now on i'll go with IBIBO or airline directly.and i'll make compaints to all the consumer sites. they had the desency saying make another booking for 15k b4 it gets more expensive and the guy kept calling and calling pushing me to make new booking.comission walla. and my 11000 rs.only getting 2700 back? see ya! Btw booked with my travel agent n she gave me a day b4 flying ticket for 3700rs when in MMT the price was 5200rs. who needs you. PLEASE PPL DONT GET FOOLED BY THE NICE GRAPHICS LIKE ME, THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF GUARANTEED! MAYBE THEY'VE CHANGED MANAGEMENT COZ B4 THEY WASNT LIKE THIS.NOW THEY RE BIG COORPARATE SHARKS! FOOL ME ONCE, SHAME ON YOU.FOOL ME TWICE, SHAME ON ME!",1
2549,"I have tried to use MakeMyTrip on a couple of instances and there had been a terrible goof-up of customer service. The first one was around an year when I booked a vacation with my wife to Manali via New Delhi. The customer service who booked had several mistakes in the ticket a few were: 1) Spelling of my wife was incorrect on the airlines itinerary 2) The hotel date itself was wrong. I had to make several calls to the hotel and MMT besides on the day of journey too to ensure things were in place. 3) The Manali bus pickup at New Delhi was again mentioned at a wrong location. When we called MMT the customer service rudely replied that they can not help in contacting bus operator because their responsibility ends by booking a ticket. The second goof-up with MMT was when I tried to book a domestic flight from Mumbai to Chennai a couple of months back. Even there the booking payment gateway tripped down. Had a long ordeal to get the payment reinstated back to the source account. I had another experience with MMT cab booking. Though MMT accepts payment via website and books a cab like from Mumbai to Thane/Pune etc, more often the cab operator calls a day later and asks us to pay for the return trip also. So we end up paying twice the charges other than what we paid online through MakeMyTrip. This hidden charge is surreptitiously hidden in the fine prints of MMT terms of service.",1
2550,"Make My Trip is only interested in making you pay booking amount which is 15000 rs per person and if there is some change in destination you will not be refunded even if you make changes well in advance i.e 30 days, Very poor customer service. Executive do not have manners to speak to customers Poor  quality of services and information, Policy not clear. ...................................... .................................... ....................................",1
2551,"We went for a tour-European Bonanza  conducted by Make My Trip from 23.5.14 to 6.6.14.On day one, we were directly taken to Rome and other places without even check-in after an air travel of more than 12 hours.Even we did not get any time to refresh our selves.Daily we had to travel ranging from 8 to 12 hours.On my interesting places time was given for clicking photos only.Despite the assurance of continental breakfast, a separate breakfast was served to MMT travelers and thus treated as low budget guests in the same hotel.Dinners were of course Indian but travelers served a basic food of Dal, Sabji, onion and on some occasions even Roti not served.No soups, starters or a good desert on many days.Many a times, you have to stand in a Q of 40 persons to pick up the food.In a nut shell it is not a luxury trip.When we traveled from Brussels to Paris, we returned to the Hotel at 12.30 in the night after traveling for 16 hours. People who want to travel for enjoyment should skip such tours.",1
2552,"The experience was very bad I must say. How can a costumer know that the premium room is the cheapest one in a specific hotel. I paid Rs.72000 for this tour and  Makemytrip actually ruined my trip. I will definitely never use your company and tell as many people as I can about your company bad services. In every hotel in which we stayed, you guys booked the cheapest room. I was booking on behalf of my dad who is a senior railway officer. We thought that you were providing good rooms in competitive cost. I mean we would have paid more for better rooms if I knew. The itinary sucked too the spots were covered in 2 hours in Dalhousie and the driver said there are many other tourist places to visit too but he can't take us there because they were not on itinerary. I can write even more about the ways you all ruined our trip but I don't have the time for that.",1
2553,"Greatest mistake one can do is to book a package from MMT. Infact its name should be SMT.ScMy Trip. Took a package for Kashmir(accommodation+transport). I had asked for hotel with a  3star rating and a AC vehicle. The very 1st day on reaching the houseboat on nageen lake, we were informed that our booking has been changed to houseboat on Dal lake. Driver did not know the location so wasted 2hrs almost locating the houseboat had no time left for sightseeing. Next day again Driver was blank about the location of Hotel Gul Paradise so decided not to waste time in searching hotel and left luggage in houseboat and went to Sonmarg. There we were told that we had to hire another vehicle to go further and the vehicle hired through MMT will no go further. While returning when we tried to call the manager of Hotel Gul Paradise, Mr Omar. He told that he has 4 properties, and we can chose any one. We didn't have any idea of locations so asked manager to talk to driver. Driver kept us wandering on account of searching hotel the manager told him. We reached the so called hotel at about 2100hrs. It was located in the residential area and by no standards it was 3star hotel. Rooms were very small just next to reception. Drinks were going on, Omar was very rude. He blatantly said if you have to stay here then its fine else contact MMT. We left the place as that place was not at all good for family and was not of standard we were charged. those rooms are available at rs 1200-1400 as shown on trip adviser and we were charged more than Rs 5000 a room with MAP. We went to search an alternate then we received a call from MMT that Omar has arranged an accommodation in 4star. When we went, we found it to be a guest house instead of 4star hotel. Rooms at 3rd floor no lift, excrete floating in commodes, no water in taps, dirty bedsheets, no mineral water, no light, we were denied dinner initially when argued some food was brought from some dhabha and given to us at 1200midnight. next day no water was available in bathroom. We were denied breakfast stating that they have no intimation regarding MAP plan. we were asked to pay the rent of the guest house and for the dinner given to us.we were supposed to go to Gulmarg as we had booked the tickets of gondola ride. But per-force we had to drop the program just because of mismanagement by MMT. All the money got poured into drain as they were non refundable. In the same guest house we met one more family who was also suffering as we were. They have also booked the package from MMT. since morning we kept on chasing MMT and MMT kept on assuring that they are trying for alternate accommodation. at 1300hrs MMT refused to provide alternate accommodation and said to contact Omar regarding Hotel. When we refused and told MMT about our agony, they said to take hotel of our choice and pay from our pockets. We went to Hotel G Sageer. Though this hotel was also on panel of MMT but MMT denied to clear the charges directly from their end. Finally we had to pay from our pockets for dinner, breakfast as well as for stay too despite we had already paid the entire amount with MAP plan. next day we left for Pahalgam, when we asked drived to switch on the AC, he refused that he has no instructions regarding this. He asked us to call his owner. When we contacted Mr Perveez the owner of vehicle he told that MMT has booked the vehicle as NAC. We asked driver to stop the vehicle at the side of road till the issue is resolved. Somehow driver switched on the AC. On reaching Pahalgam, instead of 4 delux rooms we were given 2 delux rooms and one family room. On asking manager it was informed that 4 delux rooms were not available(though MMT has confirmed that 4 delux rooms had been booked). next day we had to go to visit aru valley, betaab valley and chandanwari. We had already asked to include the transport to visit these places. Driver & Hotel manager both denied of any information regarding this. We had to book sumos on our own. When we complained Mr Perveez told that Driver Ravi will clear the bill. After returning back, when we contacted driver, he said that he is busy somewhere and asked us to pay. we refused and asked him to come and clear the bill. by the time he returned the driver of local sumo one got annoyed and kept on abusing us. Finally both drivers got into verbal and physical argument. It was really a great relief when we got freed from such HOSPITALITY of MMT. Hence ScMy Trip is more apt name for this company.",1
2554,"Dear sir, This is in reference with Europe bonanza trip which started on 24 may, 2014 first of all I would like to inform you that agency which you have given at opera house, Mumbai need to be close on urgent basis.person like Mr Kunal Kotak are giving wrong information and false promises to customer .when we first visited make my trip premises at opera house branch he showed us european bonanza 13 days package with all hotels in that.i spend two days in researching that hotels and I liked them but before two days of leaving  he gave me list of hotels which we were totally different from which he show me .when I debated with him he told that we have also written in bracket similar hotels so y u didnt told before only that hotels are going to change I wouldn't have wasted my time in researching them .also when we asked them that should we take mobile simcard from india they told us dont take u will get in europe anywhere unfortunately I didnt get anywhere and where I got I couldnt take because within every two days we ahve to change the country.really poor service from your opera branch .talking about tour we were having really good tour manager who was well experienced and was having effective communciation. this trip is not meant for person who wants too relax because we have to run like marathon for starting 5 days packing and unpacking only takes half of the time. jain food at dinner was above my expectations. there was fight between one of our group member and hotel staff at that time our tour representative was not there so I told another tour manager of make my trip who was sitting in lobby and was seeing everything but what I got response was horrible he told me that he is not from my group. does make my trip have any division they dont work altogether? hotels were pretty good. I request you to kindly request you to make this package more wonderful.",2
2555,"We have the following 11 complaints regarding MakeMyTrip. Even after posting our complaints on their website and posting the same in Akosha, no response whatsoever from these terrible people. I and my partner Prithviraj  Radhakrishnan booked package for Canton Fair from MakeMyTrip(Booking ID:  IN1403B6S174920  BOOKING REF: 3R7VER another one id: 130642). It included flight from Chennai to HongKong, Ferry from HongKong to Shekov and Coach from Shekov to Guangzhou and vice versa. It was 5 day 4 night package with one day for sightseeing. They booked Chennai – Delhi and Delhi – HongKong flight(both Air India) which had 10 hours waiting time in between(9 pm to 7 am). When we asked for lounge facility, then only they told us about Chennai-HongKong flight. Why did they book  Chennai-Delhi in the first place? They cancelled earlier booking booked in Chennai-HongKong flight(Cathay Pacific). But they booked ferry that was linked to Air India flight. Cathay Pacific flight reaches HongKong Airport at 9.40 a.m. and the ferry timing is 9.50 a.m. It’s virtually impossible to catch the ferry even if the flight arrives on time. Why did they book the ferry that we can never possibly board? They gave us all the tickets only after shouting at them several times for not sending it to us. It reached us on Saturday evening. Travel date was Monday early morning 12.20 am. Why were the tickets sent after several reminders and  after shouting at them? Ferry ticket was in Chinese. We were not informed that our ferry is linked to Air India flight(means if Air India flight is delayed, the ferry will wait for those passengers and pick them up). Why we were never informed that Ferry is linked to Air India Flight? Our flight got delayed by an hour. When we called up Amit Kumar(the MakeMyTrip travel agent - Phone number: 09990101790) at midnight 12 to confirm whether ferry will be arranged for us next day according to flight delay, at that point only he told our ferry is linked to Air India Flight. He asked us at that point of time whether our flight is Air India or not! He didn’t even bother to check these things while booking tickets for us! He told us coolly that we need to book ferry tickets on our own(HongKong Dollars 220 each). Why should we pay for ferry tickets when we paid for entire package? They booked visa for us and 4 others who came from Mumbai. As per the rules for Group Visa to China, only if all the passengers show up, they will allow us inside. The other passengers from Mumbai reached 4 hours early. They asked MakeMyTrip about us and they cancelled our Visa. Due to cancellation of our visa, we had to wait in the Shekov ferry port for 4 hours from 1 pm to 5 pm WITHOUT FOOD OR WATER. It was the most painful experience of the entire trip. Why we were never informed that group visa holders have to come together? They knew that we are coming by different flights. Why did they book Group Visas in the first place? When we asked for other passengers’ contact details from Amit Kumar, he told he has no clue. How can they book group visa without informing contact details of group visa holders? As per our schedule, it was DELUXE sight-seeing on the first day. We had planned to visit few industries on the first day. Due to the mishandling of our trip by MakeMyTrip, we couldn’t go there. Please note, this is not because of one hour delay of the airline. It is mainly because of the 4 hours we were made to sit without food or water at Shekov Port. We were totally angry and frustrated with MakeMyTrip for these delays. We came to know the Mumbai passengers had been booked Mumbai-Delhi and Delhi-HongKong flights. They had waited for 4 hours more than us and they were very very sad and frustrated with MakeMyTrip. Sincere advice to whoever is reading this: DON’T EVER BOOK TICKETS THROUGH MAKEMYTRIP. THEY ARE THE WORST TRAVEL COMPANY. Their tagline should be “worst memories unlimited”! We couldn’t meet those industry people on the remaining days – potentially losing out on our business opportunities due to bungling from MakeMyTrip. We want 20% of the package(20% of Rs. 72000) i.e., 1 day out of 5 days trip as compensation! For 2 of us it is= 28800. In the hotel, we were asked to pay RMB 600 deposit for the hotel room. Why should we pay that when we had paid the entire package amount to MakeMyTrip? In the return journey, we had to collect departure tax refund from HongKong Airport Authorities for HongKong Dollars 120 each. We were never informed about this. We accidentally came to know this while interacting with another Indian who had come by Yatra. Why we were never informed about this? Regards, Muthuraja Palaniappan 7708285395",1

The email address used at the time of booking is gopawar3@yahoo.com. The amount debited from my account is 23882.0 Below are my details Name: Prashanth K Gopawar HNO. 3-70/1, Road no. 3, Samathapuri colony, New nagole, Hyderabad - 500035 One of the worst experiences. I'll lodge a complaint in the cyber crimes department. Never use their site to book tickets or hotels. And to add to my woes, I received a call from one of the Makemytrip managers(Sameer or someone) today who says that I along with my family travelled from Hyd to Goa on the bus tickets that I had requested to be cancelled the very same day that my transaction failed. He insisted repeatedly shamelessly reiterating that we all used the bus tickets. I told him I never used the bus service and also contacted both makemytrip and the Paulo travels multiple times to cancel the same prior to my travel. The so called manager from makemytrip maintained a cool head throughout the conversion provoking me to raise my voice to assertively let him know that I never used the bus services and that he needs to investigate with Paulo travels about why they say what they say. The guy was referring to some vouchers that I never even received via email. I am shocked what standards these guys(Makemytrip) degrade to. Instead of refunding my money quietly they are playing Sherlock Homes with me. Shame on these guys!",1

2558,"Hi everyone, Its been a week since we returned from a one week trip to Thailand and I was eager to give a review, to those who would be searching for reviews on this horrible online company with quacks( I mean their overseas representative). They are a bunch of idiots  minimal experience. Due to poor planning, every alternate day of the trip was wasted. The so called city sightseeing are just eyewash with major time spent in jewel galleries where they get major commission. I even heard a overseas Thai MMT representative making racist remarks about  Indians because she was asked  by the tour group not to make changes to the planned itinerary, who were asked to check OUT of the respective hotels 12 hours before flight departure(Not in the itinerary). We managed to escape their wrath by telling them that we will plan our own itinerary on arrival at second destination and luckily saved our trip being ruined by these idiots. I have traveled extensively and have never come across this kind of behavior and hostility from any travel company. MMT if you are reading this, please rectify your overseas MMT representative and the last thing anyone will tolerate is making racist remarks. Go to hell with your company. Goodbye.",1

For the second time with me, they booked me & my wife on one PNR and my 2 minor kids on different PNRs! Few days later I got an email that my schedule has changed with no details of what has changed. I called them to find out. Looks like my Bangalore- Singapore flight has changed. I called them to get my full itinerary moved ahead by one day but for last 7 days, they have been dilly dallying on this. Today when I called their call center again, they kept me on phone, made me talk to the airline who were ready to make the change, again kept me on hold and after 45 min of call, disconnected the number.

2563,"I planned my visit to Vaishno Devi(Katra, Jammu) and opted for “Make my Trip” to book my bus tickets and it turned out to be a “NIGHTMARE” for me. This was the very first time I used the services of “make my trip”, but I can assure you that this was the last time too. I faced so many problems and I am damn frustrated with the pathetic arrangements. Firstly, I booked my tickets for 25th May 2014 in “Swagatam Holidays” because I used their services in the past and they are quite a trusted name in the bus services' industry. However, on 23rd May I got a call from your customer care and he informed me that the tickets have been canceled due to some issue. I had no options other than asking for a substitute. My tickets were booked in “Shree Sai Nath Holidays” by your executive as a substitute. I expected same services from “Shree Sai Nath Holidays”, which I was supposed to get in “Swagatam Holidays”, butI SERIOUSLY GOT NOTHING. I booked 10 seats and here are the booking details PNR/Ticket Number: SA2J9JMakeMyTrip Bus Id: NU25030956419254 Bus Operator: Shree Sai Nath Holidays Bus Type: Volvo A/C Seater Executive Luxury(2x2) PNR/Ticket Number: M7E4QY MakeMyTrip Bus Id: NU25030956419206 Bus Operator: Shree Sai Nath Holidays Bus Type: Volvo A/C Seater Executive Luxury(2x2) The issues that I faced are: It was 5:00 PM in the evening and my bus was scheduled for 6:00 PM. He picked my phone at 5.30 PM and had no idea about the bus number. I asked him to give me the bus number and in reply he said“Sir BUS NUMBER TO NAHI PATA BUT RED COLOR KI HAI AND RST LIKHA HAI AND JAHA AAP KHADE HO WAHA NAHI MILEGI”and he gave me a different location. Now, my point is why I was not informed about the change in location and why I was not given the bus number. The language used by the bus operator was not acceptable. I self-identified the bus as per the description given by the operator and boarded the bus. The second incident that happened was quite strange. There was a guy who claimed that Seat no. 16, which was mine, is his and he also had a ticket with Seat no. 16 on it booked from “Make my trip”. How can 2 people have same seat numbers? STRANGE. The same happened with one more guy, He also claimed that Seat no. 15, which was mine, is his and also had a ticket with Seat no. 15 on it. There was no operator to sort this issue out. The operator arrived at 7.15 PM and the issue was sorted out. The bus was scheduled to depart at 6.30, but it was departed at around 7.45 and there was no one to inform about the delay. The driver was there but he was only saying one line“MAI TO NAYA HU MUJHE KUCH NAHI PATA”. No water was provided. I have traveled in many Volvo buses and everyone provided water bottles, but this time nothing was provided. The bus had no video facility. The passengers were behind the bus driver to stop for dinner and the bus driver refused to listen to them. The bus was stopped @12AM in the night for Dinner. Who will eat dinner so late? We were so hungry but no one bothered for that. Lastly, and quite interestingly, the bus I initially opted for “Swagatam Holidays” was there standing in the bus stand and departed @6.30 as scheduled. I need an answer from you guys now that why my tickets were canceled? I was tortured from all corners and I won’t let this go. I need a proper explanation from you guys. I was tortured mentally. The above mentioned issues are more than serious and are not acceptable. I spent Rs. 12500 not to get ill-treated like this. I need answers to all my questions.",1

MMT has ruined my trip, I will convey this incident to my internet friends to discourage using 'make my trip'.

2565,"We are two couples travelling to Europe this May end. This experience with MMT team mumbai Opera house Where Mr Kunal Kotak was guiding us. Earlier stage while he committed us a lot, at last days of tour all the hotels were changed not a single hotel is same which is on website and itinerary. They apply for visa just 15 days prior to tour and results  we get just 5 days before the tour. MMT people told they will apply 1st week of the month while they applied on the13th of May they do late just because its a group tour and they apply in group visa, incase if its gets rejected we cannot apply again last moment and our money goes in vain. Free gifts were mentioned for 4 coupons will be given each but lastly they tell we don't have stock we will buy from archies and give it us  only 2. They provided coupons in offer which is only valid for 2 days of their promotions. Any time we asked Mr Kunal regarding hotels, visa, cancellation policy and Jain food they told don't take tension everything will be fine. At the last moment after paying the money he is giving diplomatic answer I don't anything do whatever you want I have not committed its company policy. Our journey will begin by 24th of the month. Will revert after the trip.",2

When we called the resort regarding some query for cab, they said booking is not made and rooms are not there. When we called up Makemytrip, they said they will give a room equivalent to one in Taj Vivanta, but still not got any confirmation. There are only 2 days left. After paying 57k, we still have not got the accommodation. When I called up the customer care, they say they will get back to me but still not have got the call.

2567,"I connected with MMT to plan our honeymoon in the month of Feb 2014.  The travel dates were May 12th 2014 - May 19th 2014, BookingID: IN1402B5S056117. Ms Sapna Dhake was assigned to attend to us. In the beginning the response seemed fair & enthusiastic, the rates offered to us were pretty much same as being offered by direct booking on the hotel & flight website, but after much assurance by Ms Dhake about personalized services, special attention etc etc we agreed to book our trip via Makemytrip. We made all the payments well in advance & on every conversation with Ms Dhake we emphasized on a good room & I personally requested her a billion times to mention it to the hotel that we were a newly wed couple so that we could avail the special services provided to honeymooners by every hotel these days. After the full payment was done Ms Dhake barely used to respond to our calls or msgs, & when she would, she'd give us silly excuses for not responding the queries & would never fulfill any time deadline in delivering vouchers etc, but since we were crazy busy in the wedding preps that time we ignored this behavior. On the day of travel we started just fine, feeling very excited about the trip.To our plight when we reached the hotel (HOTEL BALI RANI) on 13th May 2014 afternoon with a booking voucher by make my trip, the hotel reception informed us that we were not booked with the hotel, imagine a 12 hour journey, in a foreign country, on our honeymoon & even after booking & paying for the stay more than 2 months before the travel the room wasn't booked. The hotel refused to accept the make my trip voucher, told us that our agent hasn't made any payment to the hotel they can't let us stay with them. On top of it, I don't know what grudge they held with MMT they refused to even serve a glass of water, believe me the front office guy said, ""sorry sir, I can't serve any water right now"". When we asked them to let us use the phone to call to India to speak with MMT they refused that as well. The hotel had an open lobby the temperature was over 38 degree Celsius & we sat there for 2 hours trying to call Ms Dhake who once picked the call & with a promise of calling back in 10 mins & arguing with me in a totally unapologetic tone, asking me to be practical, never took our call for the next 2 hours. After much exhaustion we spoke to the duty manager & asked him to book our stay for a day while we try to connect to our agent back in India. We paid for 1 day & finally got a room on the 1st floor, We were so disappointed as we had requested Sapna many times to get us a room on the 2nd floor with a good view, Let's not even talk about the champagne, flowers, chocolates Sapna mentioned in the numerous telephone conversations while we discussed our booking with her. Later that day Anup another representative from MMT called us & attended to our problem & got it resolved by the next morning. He did the best but as a matter of fact our mood & the holiday excitement, happiness, was already ruined. It was the worst experience of my entire life. On our return during check in at the airport we had to pay IDR 400, 000/- as airport tax, which wasn't mentioned to us by Sapna at any point. We ran around the airport to find local currency again for almost an hour as they did not accept cards & we already spent all our local currency thinking we didn't need it anymore. We were lucky we checked in about 3 hours prior to departure or we would've certainly missed the flight because of that silly airport tax thing. People who do not attend to a customer after grabbing up their money do not belong to service industry they should be kicked out without a second chance & be blacklisted from the entire hospitality sector. I can't be more direct. It was our honeymoon for crying out loud, we paid to have fun & relax not to panic & be worried. I would never book any service with MMT in future & will surely not let anyone that I know do the same. I'm myself a hospitality professional & will spread this as much as possible among my circle to not book with MMT, so that no one else gets victimized by silly MMT representatives as we were. Highly disappointed. Thumbs down.",1
2568,"Two weeks ago I booked Royal Chalet Hotel in Mysore for a family vacation through MakemyTrip.com. At the hotel, service was very bad. Rooms were not clean. Electrical Sockets and switches were broken and hanging posing danger for kids. Television was not working and they did not even bother to fix it even after complaining. No hot water. They only claim we get hot water from 6 - 9 AM. by 7 am, hot water stops. Hotel staff only say they will fix but, no one turns up to do anything. I complained to Makemytrip and they only say that they will talk to Hotel and fix the issues. But, the hotel guys never bothered to do any fixes. Makemytrip promises money back if the amenities claimed were not  provided.However, no signs of that. Everytime we talk to them they say they will get back to us in 24 Hours. Now it has been nearly 2 weeks and makemytrip is yet to come back on the money back. I would say that Makemytrip just promises money back to attract customers and they really never do it. Don't trust these people.",1

2570,"I recently went on a domestic holiday tour to Nainital and Jim Corbett and I had got entire package booked through makemytrip.com - they have a dedicated team for domestic holiday packages. I got the entire booking done with them, starting from home location Pune till returning back to Pune. Few days after booking, I got a verification call from them asking me to verify the details of all bookings, and this is where I realized that they did not arrange my pickup from delhi airport to delhi hotel. I reported this to the person on call and he promised me to resolve this which he never did. After this I followed up with multiple people for about 5 to 6 times over almost 3 weeks and then I got a response on email that this pickup from delhi airport to hotel will be done by the delhi hotel people and makemytrip will pay the hotel for the same. After this, I was expecting to get my flight tickets, hotel booking confirmation and cab few days before the actual travel date, this never happened. One day before I again followed up with multiple people and then only I got all these details. After getting these details, when I called the Delhi hotel they confirmed my hotel booking but they did not have any information about my pickup from delhi airport. Again I had to followup on this on last day. Then I called up the cab agency on the contact number given to me by makemytrip on cab voucher for inter-city transfer and here the agency person told me that his car is no longer running with makemytrip and they still keep on giving his number wrongly to customers. This only resulted in more followups for me. During the trip I saw that the hotel rooms given to me in all locations were pathetic, in Nainital I had to pay 400/- Rs. extra to upgrade to a better room. In Corbett I was shown 3 different rooms all were in pathetic condition and I had to leave the hotel and find another hotel on my own expense with my family. Even when I called them for such issues during trip every time my call got redirected to multiple people, no one would take ownership and finally I did not get any refund for such issues. All in all, what I see is that makemytrip for such domestic holiday package, books cheapest rooms and not so good hotels and overall communication within their own team is also not good, so in my opinion this is completely waste of money, should never got with this.",1
2571,"I had my my worst travel experience with Makemytrip, com. I booked my 9 days thailand trip with MM Holidays. It was fine until the interaction is with sales team. Once you pay the amount and operations team come into picture, its all a different story. your calls will be disconnected and you will have to wait indefinitely for a response. My experience had following issues: part payment and reminder for rest of the payment. It didn't contain the passenger names and airlines PNR because of which I has trouble at the airport entry gates. Wrong information relating to Hotel check in time: At my first destination Karabi, I was informed that checkin will be at 2:00 PM. The hotel policies would allow checkin only at 3:00 PM. I reached hotel in the morning(10:00 AM) and my waiting time increased to 5 hours. Had I known this, I could have changed the flight Erroneous Transfer bookings: The transfers between Karabi and my next destination Phuket had wrong destination addressed. While my hotel bookings were with Hilton in Phuket, it was taking me to Le-Meridian in Khao Lak(a difference province altogether, 3 hr distance by car). No Hotel/Food/Transfer vouchers were sent, though promised: I was not even informed of the concept of vouchers. I didn't know any details of timings of airport transfers, the contact persons or any other details such as date/timing of planned sightseeing tours or names of hotels/restaurants where my reservations were done. a). I almost my missed my Phi-Phi Island tour. The tour operator came knocking at my door at 7:00 AM when I was fast asleep asking me to either join immediately or let go the tour. This date and timing information should have been provided earlier. Please note, I tried to reach out to makemytrip folks for details on this tour which they failed to provide. b). Despite my repeated asks, I was not provided any details of domestic airport transfers from Phuket to Bangkok. My flight was as 12:10 and your cab operator came knocking at 8:00 AM without any prior information. I denied this service and booked a cab on my own the rest of the vouchers were shared only for the Bangkok part of the trip and that too after repeated calls and chain of mails. I would strongly discourage anyone choosing Makemytrip for a holiday. And a follow on similar booking that I made for my brother in law. It was honeymoon package for them. Considering above a One off case, I decided to take a second chance and booked another holiday to Maldives. This time I was cautious to ask for Coupons, Checkin time and other stuff well in advance. But Makemytrip can always find ways to make your tour terrible. This time around they sent coupons and said that honeymoon bundle of a candle lit dinner will be provided at the hotel itself(stayed at Vellasuru Ladives). This was a special inclusion and the reason because of which I went ahead with agent based booking instead of online booking which would have costed me 15K less. This candle lit dinner costs upward of 400$ and now when my brother in law is in Maldives, the hotel is denying any information in this regard. Contacting makemytrip is of no value as they always promise to get back in 2 hr but nothing happens. PLEASE NEVER BOOK WITH MAKEMYTRIP.",1
2572,"My parents went on a Europe trip using MakeMyTrip.com? package this month; I just wanted to share my review based on my conversations with them. Europe trips are known to be tiring as you need to walk a lot, there are a lot of things to do and it's an exciting place to be so you want to do as much as you can, but when we book the tour from a professional travel agent like Make My Trip? You expect them to consider all these factors. My parents (in their 60s) flew from New Delhi to Paris (via Abu Dhabi) which is close to 12 hours of travel; after the whole group was gathered at the Paris airport, the tour guide told them to come for sightseeing! I have never heard anything like this before; they were not given a chance to freshen-up or rest; this is treating people like cattle. After spending the whole afternoon (and evening), they were brought to the hotel to have dinner and go to their rooms. This kind of treatment was evident throughout the trip. A lot of things were shown from the moving bus and the places that could have been covered in an hour (like a church), they had to wait for 4 hours. It also felt like the tour guide wanted them to spend more time at the malls etc. rather than historic places. The whole trip was an ordeal that they were going through till they reached Switzerland, where they seemed to enjoy the snowfall and the beauty of the place. Overall, this trip was a disaster and left my parents dead tired! When the feedback was shared with the tour guide, she mentioned that all Europe trips are done this way, which I know as a heavy traveller is just not true. I won't recommend this trip to anybody. MakeMyTrip.com seems to have another trip where they claim to cover 10 countries in 12 days (if I am not wrong), how do you do that without being exhausted (or almost tortured)? There needs to be a serious consideration for the tourists (customers) at Make My trip. Please do something and treat your guests with basic courtesy.",1
2573,"I was searching for hotel bookings at Mysore and got few offers through cleartrip and makemytrip. ICICI bank website had offer zone, which displays that cashback upto 15% will be availed on booking hotels/flights using any ICICI cards with cashback code 'ICICI HOT'. I chosen this offer because it seems good deal than cleartrip. While booking at makemytrip, website itself gave me a e-coupon discount code of 100 rupees and I also entered cashback coupon code 'ICICI HOT'. Cashback was not provided to me and on calling makemytrip, they told I cannot get cash back since I used e-coupon. Nowhere in ICICI Bank site and MakeMyTrip website at time of booking gave information to use only one coupon code. Information in website is unclear and response to cashback offer from customer care personal is also not agreeable.

2574,"I booked 2 tickets for 31st may to 2nd july, from jammu-delhi & delhi to calgary via frankfurt, in which they proposed me a time schedule by which I choose to book on march 7. let me be brief:- Departure Jammu, 31 May 2014, 12:45 hrs to Delhi JET CONNECT Delhi, 01 Jun 2014, 02:35 hrs to Frankfurt and then Calgary LUFTHANSA Return calgary-Frankfurt-Delhi, 02 Jul 2014, 00:30 hrs LUFTHANSA & then Delhi 02 Jul 2014, 10:55 hrs to Jammu for this offer I said yes and paid for that. on Mar 17, I got Official Lufthansa Ticket (Jammu to Calgary and return) but the domestic flights timing was changed twice without any confirmation & now my parents have to wait for 12-13hrs at Delhi for their flight to Jammu as frankfurt flight will arrive at 00:30hrs and from Delhi to Jammu flight will be at 1310 hrs. I questioned about this to Makemytrip, -They blame the airlines, that they can't do anything. They never answer or take any notice of my request to change flights sooner. At the last minute I got to know that these domestic flights are also linked with Lufthansa airlines, WHY!?(if they have to booked our domestic flights also than why I have to opt you?! why not I choose Lufthansa.com!) At the very beginning these stupid tele caller employees told me that Jet Konnect airlines are rescheduling and we will consult with them, but after some few weeks I got to know that international airlines bookes there connecting domestic flights. By sincerity of Lufthansa airlines (I mailed them on may14th about to change the domestic flights time and they revert me back on next day) I didn't cancel it and they make a reliable change for me. My question must be noticable, why not makemytrip booked domestic and international separately? Why international (Lufthansa airlines) have the right to change or mould the domestic also and makemytrip can not do anything?!

It was more of a sightseeing in Delhi where we just stared outside from moving bus as the tour manager refused to stop the vehicle sighting many reasons. In Shimla and Manali too, he had local contacts where everything (like costumes etc) were sold at high prices and he forced us to buy saying without which it will be very difficult to walk or enjoy etc. The tour manager also took us to different places instead of the ones mentioned in the package sighting so many nonsense reasons.

DON'T BOOK HOTEL FROM MAKEMYTRIP OR ANY OTHER ONLINE WEBSITES THESE GUYS NEVER INFORM HOTEL MANAGEMENT FOR CONFIRMATION. BELIEVE ME I SAW A LOT OF PEOPLE FIGHTING WITH THE HOTEL MANAGEMENT WHO BOOKED ONLINE AND WON'T GIVEN ROOMS INSTEAD THE HOTEL MGMT GIVES A CANCELLATION LETTER! BEWARE DON'T BOOK HOTELS ONLINE.",1
2580,I booked in April a Combo ticket to the Andamans consisting of an air ticket and a 3 day stag in Silver Sand at Havelock Island. Arriving in Port Blair there were for 2 days no ferry tickets available due to a ferry failure and holidays available. I informed the hotel the first evening and had to look for another hotel in Port Blair. MakeMyTrip did not even refund a part of the hotel price. I am not used to such business manners.

2581,"I Recently booked a trip to Switzerland. I went for the land package there. They committed me to the package urgently telling Rs 500 offer almost 45 days before the departure. The Visa team took 10 days to approach me and give details of papers required, telling that still time is there. Later they asked me to send all the papers to the Swiss embassy Delhi. A week later, they called me asked me to resend the papers to Swiss Consulate, Mumbai. They did not send the visa even it was ready and finally sent it after repeated calls. Through the phone system is difficult to reach, the executives. The executive is not bothered to communicate and she never responds to my calls and emails on time. I got my visa and swiss transfer card just a day before expected departure. My BP went up as I could not speak/ complain/ to anybody. Yet to go there and find out their arrangements.

However, my money (about Rs. 23, 000) got debited from my account. I had asked MakemyTrip to credit my account back with the refund so that I can buy new tickets. They kept saying that the refund will be done in 2 days. Inspite of my several requests to speak to someone senior, no one called me to this date. It has been almost 10 days and I have not yet received the refund amount. In this age, where people can transfer money in a fraction of a second, I still cannot understand why it is taking them so long to refund my money.

I was surprised to see the mail for feedback about my stay but actually I have postponed it to the month of May then I have checked my account on the makemytrip.com website but none of these postponement got updated. I felt something is wrong in this and decided to cancel my booking and sent mail to makemytrip to refund my money. And moreover, whenever I send follow-up mail, they assign new query number to that mail and fresh mail without trailing conversation. Every time I need to remind them that my query was not resolved and please don't assign new query number for every mail. Please continue to reply on my trailing mail to continue the discussion. Now they said it cannot be refunded but the postponement confirmation document which I have received from them it clearly states cancellation policy that I can cancel the booking 3 days before the booking date. In ads they claim it is hassle free and one stop solution for customer requirement but in actual they lack transparency and very weak when it comes to customer support. Regards Haranath.K",1
2586,"I was planning for a second Honeymoon after my marriage silver jubilee abroad. We narrowed down to Thailand. I was not clear as to plan my trip individually or through some travel links like Make My Trip, Yatra, Thomos Cook or any else. Some of my close friends advised me to do direct bookings particularly for Thailand, where people are very tourist friendly and by doing so things could be managed much economically. However, my wife suggested rather insisted that where we'll search for the logistics in an unknown new country, so we thought in that direction. Thomos Cook and Cox and Kings were costly. Yatra was giving many services at much cheaper rates. However it was not having any office at Lucknow so we stepped in Make my Trip's office where we met Ms Gunjan. She cordially welcomed us and briefed about many aspects and how MMT could be better than others. We took no time in finalizing our search, though with hidden suspicions. Again we had option to proceed online directly on MMT's website, but we preferred through local representative. We decided this so that we have some particular person, to whom can be bothered as and when needed conveniently. We booked a holiday package with 2 nights in Pattaya and 3 nights in Bangkok.i.e a 5 night 6 day package called Charismatic Thailand. Bit apprehensive when I booked it with part payment made in advance.  I thought I was taking a risk.But I was wrong. Ms Gunjan was quite cooperative. She readily assisted and updated our each silly most query in most professional way. She even suggested for some Add-ons, which we later realised were extremely appreciated. She arranged for local SIM and currency of Thailand at my home itself. Booked around just 15 days in advance and provided the passport details of myself and my better half was told by Gunjan that the tickets would be sent across 2-3 before the journey. He was prompt enough to revert to my questions. However the point that the tickets and vouchers would be sent 2-3 days in advance made me a little nervous. Anyway after following up with Ms.Gunjan I received the soft copy along with briefing sheet 4 days before the journey. Hard copies along with SIM were delivered physically at my residence. About the journey, we were well received by Ms Nadia(the local Thai guide/escort appointed by MMT) at Bangkok airport and transferred to a hotel for complementary Lunch (not included). There was a briefing by Mr.Tyron from MMT with several Do’s and Don'ts when in Thailand, entire Itinerary and suggestions about going around. After this, we were off to Pattaya. Hotel selection was extremely good. This was followed by group tours as well as opted tours at extra cost in Pattaya and Bangkok. With this, 2 nights in Pattaya and 3 nights in Bangkok passed off in a flash. During the entire course of the journey Ms Nadia was always there with us to make things easy and provide support. Time slots given for each place was quite appropriate. Pickups from Hotels were always on dot, which were mostly confirmed by Ms Nadia in advance. Ms Nadia was mostly ahead of other tour operator's escort/guide in guiding her group. She was always very friendly, cooperative, sincere, dedicated and committed towards her work. Frankly speaking, I was actually happily surprised with the makemytrip experience and would not hesitate to try it again or recommend it to others. It was an absolutely memorable trip planned in an excellent manner by makemytrip. Due credit and regards to Ms Nadia and other MMT's team members.",5
2587,"There is no 'interesting part' of our stay, as my experience was horrible. We travelled as a family (including parents) and after a long and tiring journey when we reached the hotel expecting a check-in, we were shocked by their response. Though we have booked the rooms well in advance paying the total amount and showed the email confirmation about the room availability from makemytrip, they refused to provide the rooms stating they have not received any information or payment from makemytrip. They also said that there is a large amount due from makemytrip, which forces them to reject such online bookings. We tried calling the makemytrip customer care and had to fight for about 1-2 hours to arrange a check-in. There was lot of confusion and nothing was set up properly. Finally when we checked-in, we have lost our valuable time and had to cancel our plans for the day. What we expected to be a pleasant and awesome trip with family turned out to be a terrible experience only because of the irresponsibility of makemytrip and hotel team. We came to know that two of our friends also had a similar experience with makemytrip and one of them had to drop the plan, cancelling their stay at the hotel booked. We have decided not to deal with makemytrip anymore and never recommend this site for anyone.",1

2589,"Makemytrip representative did not plan my trip properly. He excluded many tourist attractions. The itinerary was such that I had to spend more time inside the hotel room than sightseeing. There were nobody to receive me at the airport. I had to take the help of some taxi drivers to track down their representative. Same thing happened when I reached Neil Island. Their representatives and drivers were not at at all customer friendly. MakeMyTrip appears good in booking you and collecting money. Even though I had booked with them two months in advance, my ferry tickets were not ready in time. I could have had better trip for 60 to 75% of the cost I paid to them. Even the places like Ross Island, Chattam saw mill were not initially included even though they are right in Port Blair and very important attractions.",1
2590,"I did online booking and paid for AC+ seater bus Rs. 1, 000 Each) and due to the miss coordination between Makemytrip and Naik travel we had to catch a Non AC+ seater bus(fare at that time was Rs. 500 Each). I have called more than 4 times and also sent email for refund of actual difference but didn't get a single positive reply. Instead of compensating the actual difference amount, I got reply that we will pay you only Rs.200 each. It was really a hopeless thing, it is not the matter of 1000 bucks but after begin a loyal customer to them they were not ready to support. I escalate the issue to them for more than 5 times, no response from their worst management team. I will never make the mistake to book with MMT in the future.

2591,"I booked a round trip domestic flight between Madurai and Mumbai and the price was pretty much the same as I would have gotten from the airlines website directly. This is fine at first. But beware when it comes to any changes or cancellation in your itinerary. The airlines charged about Rs.1600 for cancellation. But MMT adds a whopping Rs.2000 processing fees on top of it. That too, it says as approximate amount and the actual refund is even lesser. This is an absolute scam as the actual refund will always come out lesser than the quoted amount online when you do the cancellation.  If it's a matter of couple of hundred rupees on top of airline cancellation charges, it makes sense. But this is just robbery. What processing fee?  Everything is computerized. This should be a percentage of airline's cancellation charges and not almost double that of. I will never ever use this website again and so should you. Good Luck!",1
2592,"Reasons To Avoid Doing Business With makemytrip.com (mmt) R1. Mmt screens incoming calls --- I am absolutely convinced. R1.1. If you select “new booking” from their phone menu they will take your call. R1.2. If you select “existing booking” they will either (a) not pick up the call at all, or (b) place you on hold, then disconnect you after sixteen minutes on hold. R1.3. If you select “dial an extension”, if you happen to have an employee’s extension number, the employee is free to decide whether or not he or she wants to take your call. Chances are she'd rather not. R1.4. Only if you complain on their FB site will their “Department of Customer Delight” (yes that’s what it’s called) step in and respond to your phone calls. R2. Mmt will try and shake you down for any extra change they can extort. R2.1. The terms printed in my ticket said a $350 charge will apply for any reschedule + any fare difference. R2.2. When I requested a reschedule they wrote March 10 to say that I will be liable for $610 + $50 mmt service fee + fare difference. R2.3. I wrote back to say I’d be damned. I pointed at the terms in my ticket. R2.4. They wrote back again, same day, to say that they will charge me $350 + 5% service tax on (airline penalty + fare difference). R2.4. On April 4 they asked instead for $350 + $50 service fee + fare difference. R2.5. Mmt finally offered to sell me a reservation for $350 plus a fare difference of $490. They were being extra nice to me, they had the temerity to suggest. That sums to $840. I said surely there’s a cheaper ticket online. They checked and they said: ah yes, you can get a new one-way ticket for $670. Please go book it at the mmt website, they suggested. I'd have to be such a damn fool! R2.6. Should the idea that they need to get me a good fare not have occurred to them of their own? R3. Some employees are careless. Some lie. R3.1. Here are “phone numbers” an employee sent me by way of email: “For any further assistance we are available round the clock on our toll free number 1-800-11-8747 / … / 95124-4628700 (Any Landline).” Neither of these numbers clearly makes any sense. And their availability is not 24/7. It is 0/0. R3.2. An employee wrote in email, and later told me on the phone, that she had called me April 2, at about 4:30 pm. My phone shows no missed calls that afternoon or evening. R4. Phone manners R4.1. The greeting is delivered by a lady who sounds like she’s about to pat your a.s and chide you playfully for pinching her again. She’s extra-jocular, and sports a Hoxbridge accent from Gurgaon. She is actually a typical specimen of the sort they appear to catch around here for telephone jobs. R4.2. The hold announcement repeats ad nauseam every five seconds. Fifteen minutes of that is enough to drive anyone crazy. R5. Shuttle-cock strategy R5.1. If you get in through the “new booking” route, the India office will tell you that since you made your booking in the US their “US Department” will call you. They most certainly will not. R5.2. If you get in again through the “new booking” route, the India office will tell you to call their US office at a 1-800 number, which you cannot call from an Indian phone. R5.3. Then they will suggest you live-chat on-line with the US office. R5.4. The live chat agent will disconnect you most abruptly at the drop of a hat. There is no chat transcript. Before the agent disconnects he will ask you to call the India office. R5.5. After two chat sessions, there will be no more chats. Your chat budget is done. You will get an unresponsive yellow screen that asks you call the India office, and gives you a 1-800 US number for good measure. R6. Bottom line R6.1. I have wasted at least 40 hours waiting on hold, calling, getting cut off, and writing email messages to mmt. R6.2. I was nearly a no-show (my ticket would have voided) on my original return date because mmt would not pick up my calls for five days, nor call back, or in any way process my change of reservation. I had to call the airline directly, in panic at the last minute, to cancel my return reservation. R6.3. Shoot yourself in the foot before you think of doing business with this terrible company. Be a good Samaritan. Please forward to every traveling person you know.",1

2596,"For any people looking to book a full holiday through MakeMyTrip, especially for Africa, please go through the below experience my wife and I faced, when we recently booked a Kenya holiday through them. While one or two mistakes is understandable, MakeMyTrip folks did not doONE SINGLEthing right. We have not even captured some other mistakes below. The only good thing was that they had outsourced the actual tour in Kenya to an agency calledSafari Trails.Safari Trails did an outstanding joband we highly recommend them. Best way to go to Kenya would probably be book your own air tickets and book the holiday itself with Safari Trails or a similar local agency directly. List of MakeMyTrips screw ups: We initially tried booking the holiday online through their call center. After giving us the booking id, the call center executive was supposed to contact us to guide us through the payment modalities. This person never contacted us and didn't receive our calls for 3 days continuously when we tried following up from our end We finally booked through MakeMyTrip's physical Mumbai travel office at Mahim by making token payment through an executive called Sahhil Badlani. Our new booking ID wasIN1401B4S197587. Kept following up for balance payment but they didn't revert. When the concerned executive, Ms Sharayu Chavan, did revert after many follow ups, she sent us wrong travel dates. May instead of March! After we told her the error, she corrected the dates and told that since the dates were close we would have to pay the entire large balance amount i.e. 1 lakh 90 thousand approx by the next day itself. We still somehow quickly arranged funds and paid. Payback loyalty points for our payment were credited to incorrect payback number. We followed up repeatedly and after that Saahhil confirmed around end Feb 2014 that its been credited to our correct payback number. However, till date today, we have not received the points. Information on yellow fever vaccine required to travel to Kenya given by Sharayu was incorrect and outdated by at least 3 years. We figured the correct one on our own and got the vaccination done. Tickets given one week before travel had incorrect travel dates. Rectified tickets given 2 days before departure were not paid in full and we weren't told about this. Got to know only at airport (at 5 am on a Sunday when no one from MakeMyTrip is reachable) where the airline Air Arabia told us they cannot let us board without the balance payment. They told us they accept only INR cash (no credit card). Had to withdraw 11k hurriedly from ATM (we usually don't keep high cash balance) and almost missed our flight. Sent mail to Sharayu and Saahil Badlani from Mumbai airport itself regarding this ticket payment issue and to escalate for refund with scanned copy of our payment receipt. however they didn't bother to respond. After our Kenya trip (the Kenya leg was handled very excellently by Safari Trails - a local agency) at Kenya airport while returning, we learnt that with effect from 1 march 2014 Indian govt needs both yellow fever and polio vaccination for Kenya travel. We weren't told about the polio vaccine while our co-passenger who also booked through MakeMyTrip was told about the same. I was questioned both at Kenya airport and on arrival at Mumbai airport where I had to haggle with the authorities for 20 mins saying that I have got polio vaccine as a child, before they let me go. They could have quarantined me at Mumbai airport for 3 days (as has been done in past cases of no yellow fever vaccine) - however thankfully they did not do so for polio. After we called and shouted at them, Sahhil replied saying that the excess cash we paid at Mumbai airport for our Air Tickets is being refunded. We also wrote a complaint on MakeMyTrip Facebook page. We got a reply saying that they will call us (took our phone number) and discuss. However, then we got a reply from their Facebook page admin saying that their Mumbai office has informed that the issue is sorted. They never called to understand the entire harassment we faced. Also, till date, we have not received the refund Earlier this week(on 24th March), I wrote to Sahhil saying that my Payback points have still not been credited and gave him snapshots of my Payback card statement to prove this (he had confirmed they had been credited a month back). He totally ignored this mail. I again wrote a reminder yesterday. He again totally ignored this mail. After having lost patience, we called and after multiple tried got through to him today. Instead of being really apologetic, he kept arguing with me about what my issue was- getting money back, getting points, or the fact that he was not replying to mails- it was shocking behaviour. So, net net, I have undergone endless harassment, not received my money refund yet, not received my payback points, and the executives still keep saying they have sorted everything out . MakeMyTrip seems to be full of people who are liars or incompetent or both. Debdutta Sanyal.",1
2597,"My worst experience form any travel booking website is on MakemyTrip.com, and that too when I consider that I was a frequent use to their services before. Now I tell everyone, my friends & family, to never ever use Makemytrip.com. They charged me twice for 2 failed tickets which never got booked because of technical failures, and then refused to pay the money back immediately and then made me wait 4 weeks, 5 phone calls and 10 emails. To add misery to the agony Makemytrip.com didn't even returned the full amount stating that my card had a cash back scheme and the remaining money will come later. Imagine your INR 26, 000 blocked with a company for 30 days for a flight that was never booked. And then getting refund in 4 parts. And the worst part is their customer service. They just kept on closing the case with totally irresponsible remarks like, ' We tried calling you and couldn't reach you. Therefore we close the case. Pl call us back.' And when you do call them, then they tell you to write them an email. Absolutely hopeless company is Makemytrip.com. And when I looked on forums on internet, I found that I wasn't a lone sufferer of their useless customer service.",1
2598,"I had a very bad experience with makemytrip. I tried to book a package for Bali, Indonesia. The package rate shown in the website was INRs 50000 (incl taxes), but I tried to talk to the agent for detail understanding of the package, it came out to be INRs 56000. They kept on changing the rates, and not for the good. Everyday, I received a call, mentioned there was some problem and the cost has to be revised. I could still see the package cost in the website to be INRs 50000 Ready to be booked. But finally I sent an advance of INRs 20000. Later I had to postpone my ticket, before 20 days of travelling, by 3 days, then they mentioned and extra cost of INRs 40000.00!. I said cancel the tickets, then the agent mentions that they have paid for the tickets and it cannot be cancelled WTH!. Well. Overall. A very bitter experience with Makemytrip. Please Clarify all before you book, or else they will trap you.",1
2599,"This is Sreenivasarao (+919841012761) from Chennai booked Rajasthan 9D8N trip for my family (including parents & children). As per trip plan, they are suppose to arrange good tempo traveler at Delhi Airport. But, they arranged a old tempo traveler with some renovated interiors to pick us from airport. As soon as we noticed weak air condition in the vehicle, we have called more than 20 times in 4 hours and spoke with 7 to 8 people in MMT on the same issue. They don't have courtesy that we have Old aged parents & kids and after 4 hour of waiting on Delhi roads, they demanded 20K to arrange another vehicle with good air-conditioning. Later after visiting hotels booked at various locations in Rajasthan, we realized hotels are just comparable to Lodges in tier 1 cities, but MMT says these are all 3 star hotels. I sincerely suggest not to go with MMT for any kind of travel bookings. Thanks & Regards, Sreenivasarao.Thuthika",1
2600,"The MMT website could be the best among other and easy to use. I am writing this note to note my displeasure about the membership program and pathetic customer service. They claim that the customer will be upgraded to higher tier in case a particular amount of purchase is done. In my case I had to call and email them to get the same upgraded. Even after upgrade of account my points were getting accrued at the previous tier. I have been chasing them since July 2013 but other than getting stupid responses have not got an answer. 24 to 72 hours can be anything from 24 hours to many months. It is their discretion as to when they will reply. My current response is about 1.5 months due with no response. and this is from the highest level of escalation (write to management) in MMT. This is the support they are giving me to a "" Platinum "" member which is the highest they. God knows what will be the service(if that is any different) to regular customers. The ticket / reference number gets closed with notes that the issue has been escalated to specialized team. I had to open the tickets multiple times to keep my issue open. If you are communicating with them via email then each time you reply to the email they close the ticket as resolved and then open a new one. Maybe this way they can save on the Service Level of the tickets. I now go to my MMT account and respond from there only. This way I can have all the response in one tab instead of looking in 100 tabs for a simple query which requires only a simple mathematical calculation and not any deep research that MMT has been doing since July 2013. If you ask them question X they will reply to Y or Z. I just dont seem to understand why they can read my issue and answer to the issue. I have written them in a very basic and laymans level of English. But still they cant seem or rather dont want to understand my issue. If you are enrolled with MMT reward program then please check the statement especially before the current program was launched. Somebody had suggested in this forum to log complaint with https://pgportal.gov.in/Grievance.aspx. I have done the same but not very sure if it could be of any use.",2
2601,"Hello People, I think I had bad experience with this site. Better avoid it. I booked ticket with them, had to cancel the ticket for personal reason. Their conditions say, tax fares may be refundable, when you call them its general, and nothing is refundable. They charge ridiculously high amounts for rescheduling the tickets $375 is too much + fare difference. They respond to email super later. They didn't respond to first email, upon sending second one, they responded after 9 days.BETTER AVOID THIS SITE. happy travel.",1
2602,"Hi, I would like to share my experience with this agency, I had already gone with this agency for Bangkok trip few years before, it was nice though they made some important places as optional one which was little bitter for us yet we booked for Paris Swiss delight because its the only package starting from Chennai and it was the cheapest European package among all the travel agencies. but is it? its 5n/6d trip, of which only 2 days covers in the package others 3 days comes as ""optional"", but we were fine with it and we booked. Then comes the visa part where I regretted my decision of choosing this agency. I literally lost all my interest in going to Europe. The agent who booked our tickets did not provide us with the correct info. They kept increasing their tour package price, first due to rising Euro rates, later because we are boarding from Chennai. But the tour package starts from chennai and thats why we choose the first place. Anyways, then comes the wrong info. he told us we might have to attend the interview for Swiss Visa and he asked us to come to mumbai. We asked why did you apply swiss visa when you can apply for France Visa, there were no proper reply, then when asked whether Swiss embassy is in Chennai? Can we attend in Chennai? There was no proper reply, he very well told we can attend in Chennai. Okay. I am from Chennai, if I am having a visa interview in Swiss embassy in Mumbai when should my agent inform me? well my agent informed me 2 days before my interview and I've to book flight urgently to Mumbai. The worst part is, apart from paying 20k bucks for flight, the attitude shown by that agent was really bad. he asked ""you can go to Europe alone but you can't go to Mumbai."" I don't know what was his problem he was the one who didn't provide us with correct info and now he just wants to escape somehow. I really don't know how the rest of the trip will be. I thought a travel agency's work was to simplify our trips and give us good memories, well sure ""make my trip"" was not doing that job very well, because they have complicated my trip so badly. If you ask if you suggest Makemytrip for your family, friends, colleagues, Hell no!",1
2603,"This company was the biggest waste of time and money!  DO NOT USE THEM- I made a detailed itinerary of the places I wanted to go and when, so they didn't have to do much but they still managed to mess our trip up! They wasted our time by putting us places we didn't want to go to and took away places that we did want to go to. They gave us a driver that had no idea where he was going(although he tried his best)- the company should've provided him with a GPS or given us someone who knew where they were going! We spent most of the time on the road due to their poor planning! When I went to their office to complain, I asked them if they had any standard for customer satisfaction- the manager, Hardeep Singh Chauhan replied by saying ""Kind of""- Would you use a company who ""kind of"" wants to make their customers happy? I sure don't! On top of that, Mr. Chauhan and the rest of the Vadodara staff did not seem to care about our concerns what so ever and was even so rude by talking over me the whole time I was trying to voice my complaints! TERRIBLE COMPANY, TERRIBLE SERVICE! They have absolutely NO concept of customer satisfaction.",1
2604,"Hello All, Just like to inform you never ever purchase hotel + flight deals from makemytrip. It will be costly and you will not get good deals like free breakfast etc. Its better to take separate deals. One more thing I have observed on Makemytrip is that while booking flight or any package (flight + hotel) they will increase price while your transaction is taking place, though it will ask you to confirm, but people generally accept as they have make their mind at that time and very few will cancel deal because of this. I have never observed same thing from any other travelling or airline like this. Secondly, their hidden refund policy which no one can read while doing transaction. People will read this when they want to cancel or change. They have no refund policy on flight + hotels deals. Go for Expedia or Yatra, they are far better than this. Below is the typical reply from make my trip, if you think this is appropriate then try makemytrip else never use this site. _ Thank you for contacting MakeMyTrip Customer Support for changing the hotel with the Booking ID NP2801930627299. We understand your concern that you want to change the hotel to Palolem Beach, Goa. As per the hotel cancellation policy that was shared on the MakeMyTrip website at the time of booking (and also mentioned on the hotel voucher, ) this reservation falls under No Refund policy. This means that in the event of a cancellation, the full booking amount for this booking will get forfeited and no refund will be processed by either MakeMyTrip or by hotel. Please refer to the attached voucher that was shared as a confirmation to this booking, which mentions the following cancellation policy: “Non-refundable rate: 100% of the total cost will be charged in case of cancellation “ Hence, for changing the hotel Pam Pirache Resort, Goa, the same needs to be cancelled and is non refundable. Furthermore, the individual components i.e. either the flight or the hotel stay cannot be cancelled. In case of cancellation of both the components(flight and hotel stay), cancellation policy of individual components(given below) will be applicable. Flight plus hotel bookings are non-amendable. For any further assistance, please call us on our toll free number 1800-11-8747(from MTNL/BSNL users) OR 1800-102-8747(from other major operators). You may also contact us by replying to this email or write to hotelservice@makemytrip.com and we shall revert to you within 24 hours. We value your business with us and look forward to assisting you in all your travel plans. - Hope people will understand the evil doing of makemytrip.",1
2605,"We went to Shimla as a couple in the month on Feb 2014, it was told to us that the hotels that are booked are the most amazing ones with at least 3 star rating. When we reached it was nothing like we booked. One of the hotels in which we had to stay lacked basic amenities like hot water and electricity. When we reached the weather was not so supportive so the electricity was gone in Shimla but hotel did not had a generator support either. I contacted Make my trip millions of times for the refund as well that I was eligible as per my card even that has not been refunded. I asked for partial refund that they did not agree either. I am from Ahmedabad and do let me know in case you need more review about this pathetic website.",1
2606,"I got my hotels and cab booked for my honeymoon trip through MakeMyTrip. My booking ID is IN1311B2S122870. It was a 5 days and 4 nights (mini Kerala trip).

Day 5: Alleppey - Cochin(95 km/2.5 hours) Meals: Breakfast After a delicious breakfast, check out of the hotel. Drive to Cochin and transfer to the airport/railway station for your onward journey. It's all started from Bangalore only. I received the number of a guy who was responsible for our cab. But after trying many times, he didn't pick the call. I contacted MakeMyTrip(after trying so many calls) and then Hiten assured that it will get fixed. I was anxious during my flight. Somehow it went well. The driver was waiting for us with my name on a board. Driver was the only good thing happened to us in the entire trip. He was very supportive and friendly. After reaching Munnar, we got to know that our booking was not confirmed with Tall Trees Resort. There were network related issues too. I tried with all my numbers but none of them worked. I took the help of receptionist and tried from their landline. One of their room were available and they accommodated us there after making us wait for more than hour. My wife doesn't feel comfortable with the valleys. She was having headache and dizziness. In that condition, she was forced to wait in car. Hotel confirmed our reservation later with MakeMyTrip. Same thing happened again with the next hotel Misty Mountain. Even there the booking was not confirmed. Luckily we found a vacant room there. Again, we waited for more than an hour. there was a taxi strike in Kerala on 1st of March. We informed Hiten about that. He assured that we are not going to face any problem now. he confirmed us about the reservation with the Michael Inn in Thekkady. We left for Thekkady in the night around 3AM. After reaching Thekkady, my wife fell sick again. I went to the reception and asked about my room. I got the same answer. There was no room booked on my name. I was ready to pay the room rent from my own pocket but this time not a single room was available. Because of strike, it was risky for us to roam around for a hotel room. And wife's condition was worsening. I was completely clueless. I called Hiten again. He was sleeping. He didn't pick the call. After trying for so many times, finally he attended the call. He suggested a hotel. we went there, but it was one of the worst hotel I have even seen. I refused for that. He got the reservation in some other hotel. It was only okay type, nothing in comparison to Micheal's Inn. But we were left with no other choice. My wife was not in a good condition and strike related risk was increasing. I thought, atleast we will have some fun in Allepey and we would be able to end the trip on a happy hotel. But worst was waiting for us. We reached Allepey on 2nd of March. This time reservation was there with JCT houseboat on my name. I got it confirmed before leaving for Allepey. But they gave us the worst house boat available with them. It was completely unhygienic. Stinky smell was there. The pictures shared by Hiten was completely different with the one provided to us.JCT associate informed that picture shared with us was of premium class and our booking was in lower class.May I know the reason for the same? I called Hiten, he switched off his mobile. I tried Ritesh from MakeMyTrip too, but he also didn't pick the call. Somehow we started with that houseboat and after 10 minutes the boat got some mechanical problem. We waited for around 1 hour. After that I called the manager of the houseboat and we told him to change our houseboat. He was left with one houseboat only and whose condition was worse than this. None of us(Me or my wife) was ready to continue in that houseboat because of stinky smell, unhygienic condition and the overall condition of the boat. We asked them to return our money back. But they told us to talk with MakeMyTrip. We tried many times to contact MakeMyTrip. But they didn't pick the call. We left the boat and shifted to another hotel on my own expense. In the morning left for the Bangalore and this way our honeymoon got over. I could have planned a far better trip on my own. But I didn't want to take any pain in this trip that's why I went for MakeMyTrip. But I had the worst experience of my life. I was ashamed in front of my wife because of this trip. My honeymoon trip got completely screwed because of MakeMyTrip. I have already lodged a complain with MakeMTtrip but didn't hear anything back from them. Contacted customer care more than 5 times but every time they forwarded call to some one and I waited for more than half an hour but no one picked the call. I want my money back along with the compensation for the our mental and physical harassment because of MakeMyTrip. I am unable to understand how come those people fool the customer like this?",1
2607,"I booked an international return flight ticket for my friend Mr. Sachin with the Booking ID: NN230146524964 on 21-Jan-2014. The ticket costed me INR 52740.00 On the day of travel on 01-March-2013 he collected his boarding pass and sat on the flight after clearing immigration only to offloaded few minutes before the take off with the reason that the ticket was invalid / cancelled. It was 9:30 PM in Germany (1:00 AM IST) so my repeated calls (Unfortunately I was also in Germany during this time) to MMT Call centre were unanswered. When I got connected finally on 02-March-14 I was told that its airlines mistake and the issued ticket is valid. When I asked for a resolution I was told that it would take 24-48 hours (normal TAT) for resolution as MMT needs to contact AI. However MMT people failed to recognize and expedite the process despite the fact that my friend was struck in an international location and a normal TAT would not make any sense at this point. However, I never received any response from MMT even till date. So finally to find a fast paced solution I had to call customer care many times (20-30 times and costed me more than 40 Euros) due to various facts like a. Either system do not accept the booking ID I entered. b. It connects to domestic call center instead of Internal customer care. c. My calls were put on hold for extremely long times(10-15 mins) without any updates so had to hang n call back again A series of reference id's(140302-007645, 140302-057521, 140303-032723, 140303-075111, 140302-066802) were created with irrlevant descriptions so I had to check each and every reference id to make customer care people understand my concerns. So finally decided to narrate the story everytime. After fed up I insisted in talking to floor supervisor and Paras Bajaj who gave me an interim solution that ""Change the travel dates so that my friend gets home"" and in the meantime we sort out the issue. This suggestion also had a caveat that I need to pay for the date change penalty charges, fare difference etc., Unfortunately I had no other choice so had to go with that. A new ticket was issued after paying approx INR 15000. Fortunately the reissued ticket was checked with Air India frankfurt office who confirmed that it is valid and my friend took the flight on 03-Mar-14 to New Delhi. Air India frankfurt office also confirmed that the ticket booked on 21-Jan-2014 was cancelled by MMT on 22-Jan-2014. 1.How and why the booked ticket was cancelled? 2.How this can happen and if this has happened why I did not get the money refunded. 3.Is someone trying to siphon off the money by employing third rated methods and putting consumers at unexplainable mental agony. 4.I paid date change penalty charges for re-issuing the tickets so paid INR 15K extra for the ticket I had bought for 52K earlier. This is a fraud. So MMT need to reimburse me the excess amount I paid immediately along with penalties for employing fraudulent means to cash in more money. 5.MMT is liable to pay cancellation charges for the connecting trains(from Delhi to Lucknow) which were cancelled since he could not travel on 01-Mar-2014 Everytime I get the same response from Shikha John, Jyoti Chouhan, Dipti and other customer service executives that they are validating the case where airline cancelled the ticket and would revert in 24 hours. This is getting repeated from 03-Mar-2014 Can your team look into this and help me with the refund along with the compensation for the mental agony and the harassment I underwent during these difficult time. Confirmation obtained from Air India Frankfurt office is attached in my complaint to MMT along with the ticket for resolution. Regards, Pradeep",1
2608,"Hi, Their site is good and the customer service does sweet talk with you. However never go for this site, in case of any trouble please be prepared to lose your hard earned money. I had been informed by customer care that if you provide 20% as the package amount upfront then no charges will be deducted before 45 days. However nothing was said that this will be in the form of travel vouchers to be redeemed at Makemytrip only. Not sure how their overrated trips are, however bad experience, never again using Makemytrip for anything from now. Lost a genuine customer and his friends.",1

The higher authority also doesn't take the matter seriously. I am not sure when the refund will be done. Be careful while making bookings or any cancellations because of network issues. They are very prompt in arranging the booking for you, but very slow in refunding. Hopeless. Really frustrating.",2
2610,"Please don't spoil your trip by booking with Makemytrip. They will take all money in advance and then they will never call you, you have to keep chasing them for each and every thing like visa, tickets, booking passes and they will not even respond to your email, or phone calls. Never ever book with them.",1
2611,Worst ticket booking n hotel booking service. Never opt for this site. These ppl never respect customer or their money. Simply avoid Makemytrip if you're planning a trip. This is not at all a genuine place. Avoid this for God's sake. I planned a flight round trip and booked hotels according to it. I received a simple message from Makemy trip: Sorry. Spoiled my trip by saying my flights are cancelled.,1
2612,"I booked a hotel with id - NH2P10293197877 and got a confirmation message as well, where as on reaching the manager tells us there is no room available/booked. My first and LAST transaction ever with MMT. Left us with no accommodation. Bad experience. To top it they have a lousy customer service and they think a 500 rupee voucher will solve all the discomfort. Horrible Service.",1
2613,"We booked Kerala tour package from MakeMytrip in dec 2013. but we had a worst experience with it and very disappointed with what was the offered. We booked deluxe double bed room with extra bed with all the hotels and also paid for the same but when we arrived at the hotel they just provided 1 double bed room only.:( on booking time they said about the bed tea or coffee will be served but we never get during entire hotel stay. 3.we also had booked AC Indica car. but the driver of cab never allow us to start AC through the journey. very disgusting The cab driver was also not ready to show all the sightseeing. every time we had to push him to let us go there. the cab driver also took extra money for car parking, toll tax etc. In short I never recommend any one to book any travel package with MakeMyTrip. Many times they offer package with comparatively low cost but indirectly they give worst experience which makes vacation hell. Tried to contact many times with the customer care on this issue but after 3 months also I did not received any proper response from MAkeMyTrip.",1
2614,"Do not book your tickets with MakeMyTrip, they will cheat you. See what happened to us. We booked a trip for 2 families in October from MakeMyTrip. Until the booking the agent (Mr Kishore) acted very nice. He mentioned that he was the point of contact for this booking and and we can call him anytime he even gave his cell phone number. At the end of Nov, Kishore got back to us asking us to pay the rest of money. We made the final installment on 19 Dec. However I realized that Suraj has not sent us the confirmation vouchers (I had asked him the same earlier but didn't worry too much as we had enough time). When Kishore sent us the vouchers, to our surprisehe has booked in a totally different hotel then what we had asked for.Once we started making calls, Kishore started out giving all sorts of excuses: -Other team made the mistake, I only do sales, I don't know how this happened. -This hotel is as good as other, what is your problem ? Even on constantly asking him to get us to talk to his manager, he would say he would get back to us in hour but never did. On calling his cellphone, he constantly rejected our call and sent us the message that ""I am out of office, please contact 1800 customer service). Since there was still some time to our tripI tried calling them using their 1800 system but this was of no use, unlimited waits and no one to respond,so I raised a complaint using their system131221-027677on 21 Dec. The replies I got back from their customer service was, ""We apologize that you were unhappy with our agents. We can understand your feelings and we have already taken serious steps on our representatives who were involved in this issue."" This is the best way MMT thought they can get out of this, blame it on agents as this is not their fault after all. I escalated the complaint further and I get similar response, this time MMT has gone on blaming their vendor. The response I got was ""We would like to inform you that from our side we already shared the strong feedback to seller so that same thing not happen with any other guest. We would like to inform you that Misty Mountain Resort was sold out and there was no room available for same date so that seller gave you alternative option of Eastend Munnar and both are on the same category. Hello, I was talking to MMT all the time not the vendor, If I wanted a regular vendor there are lots of them next to my house. Post the trip I raised it to the third level and Kajal Devi from MMT trip called me, after the discussion she agreed that there has been a mistake on their side and she will resolve the issue in 48 hours. Looks like MMT trains people to make such wrong promises. Kajal Devi never got back even I reminded her few times. I finally escalated the issue to Management and complaint got assigned to Geeta Eral, Head, Customer Delight, guess what she did. She assigned it back to Kajal Devi who responded saying she will resolve in a day and its been 2 weeks and no further replies from her. This is only the hotel part, We had asked to book a 7 seater Innova for us and I had specifically asked to mention this in the voucher. He kept saying he will take care of all this and there is nothing to worry. On the day of our trip what we saw is we got a 6 seater innova and their Bangalore agent clearly told us, ""We were not give any such requirement, if we want we can take the car or leave it.""  Since we were in Mysore the next day we tried to contact MMT to see if they can get it changed by the next day, the response we got is that their agent is not reachable so nothing can be done. So we had to adjust in this car throughout the trip. (imagine how difficult it is with kids) As a family we had booked all our hotels as resorts and we wanted the same here. However we were stuck with a third grade hotel and this destroyed whole of our trip. *So even after paying so much money, we had one of the worst trips thanks to MakeMyTrip. Forget about poor customer service, MakeMyTrip is here to cheat you. DO NOT BOOK your trips with them otherwise all you will get is BAD memories unlimited.*",1
2615,I have booked my 3N/4D holiday to Delhi from Ahmedabad and it was last minute planning. But fortunately I got best deal on Makemytrip. I got return flight ticket with 5 star hotel accommodation including food at less than 15K. Customer care service was also good. While booking my transaction was stuck in midway and within five minute I got call from customer care and they sort out problem immediately. Great customer service. Thanks to MakeMYTrip for a wonderful holiday.,4
2616,"I booked a ticket with ICICIDF coupon code very recently. It got applied also. I was supposed to get a cash back of Rs 1000 based on that. I booked ticket and completed the transaction, hoping that cash back will come in few days. But now the customer support is saying that I never used any coupon code and won't be receiving any CASH BACK. So my advise to others is that please go to other sites where you can have real cash backs. If any customer care of MakeMyTrip is following up on the review. My complaint number is:140207014827.

2617,"Beware of a big cheating from Makemytrip agents. Yesterday I booked two tickets to U S and back to Kochi. While we are finding a lowest one and going for internet payment, their service agent called us and saying that ticket is not available for this amount now. They can offer me for this amount. (min 5000 Rs increase) They tried to misguide us like any thing. Even we cannot find that ticket option in our computer, so we accepted their offer. After some time agent sent a mail to me with payment link. I paid entire amount to them. (big mistake) After 15 mts I got another call saying that this ticket is not available now again I have to pay more or change the date. This time I told them I don't need ticket refund amount. Call ended. No communication for 2 hrs. I tried several times their call center but I was not able to contact the agent. Again another agent called, he told me this ticket is non refundable and for booking I have to pay 5000 Rs more otherwise I will lose entire money, but the thing is that the same ticket is available in another sites with a 10000 Rs less amount. I lost around 6 hrs and tension was horrible. I told them I am going to complaint then they are trying to bargain. So pls beware about this and never depend on agents.",1
2618,"This is in regards to my below mentioned booking which the Hotel Staff is ignoring to entertain and attend. It is indeed a horrifying experience where the hotel staff is refusing to attend its commitment as a part of prior booking done via MAKE MY TRIP site. This is a shocker to me as I landed in the city with a prior booking for 5 days and Hotel Staff has been turning out completely ignorant on this. This is shame on the hotel as well on the part of MAKEMYTRIP part where the end customer is made to suffer. Can you please look into this issue as why this has happened and provide a solution to this at the earliest, I will need an accommodation for 5 days to support my stay in Bangalore and I have made all requisite arrangements on this stay? I am in a new city and the staff is not ready to accept the Booking Voucher I have. As I have already shared my horrifying experience with your services per my prior e-mails  and multiple calls, and now would like to state that support from MakeMyTrip Team as well on this was something that you expect from such esteemed organisation. I would like to share challenges that I faced today: First of all, your integration and engagement with hotels did not work and due to some goof up at your or hotel’s end, my confirmed booking was not entertained. If this is the case, then hotels like Chancery Pavillion should be blacklisted from your portal or you should raise it with their senior management on why messed up so much. I had to waste 3 hours in this entire process today trying to request and chase people for no reason but nothing came to rescue. I did call up your representative in Bangalore Office(Mr Nitin – 09620354732) who stunned me by saying he cant help as you are dealing with online team and I am from retail store – Shocker this was! I ended up making 5 different calls in a period of 2 hours to discuss and check what is happening on this issue but took 5-10 min each time to get through to the right person. I was promised a call back in 10 min, but got the first one after an hour and that too MakeMyTrip officials were not able to sort this mess for me. This issue only got sorted when I resorted to file a Customer Complaint as a litigation in the Consumer Court where I have been exposed to harassment and cheating from MakeMyTrip and they have completely failed to keep their promises and were also not able to handle such issues. The service quality level to deliver and handle issues is way beyond If this is the existing process that you have at your organization, with due respect I would encourage all to not to use your services and will ensure that nobody else has to go through this agony. A HORRIBLE AND FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE OVERALL!",1
2619,I booked Duabi and Mauritius trip with MMT. Please don't book any trip with MMT if you really wants to enjoy.

We paid booking amount and fall into trap of MMT. 2) Our 3 and 8 yrs Kids and we starved due to MMT provided guide. 3) We have missed 4 attraction in Dubai due to MMT. 4) when we asked for compensation MMT offered just ticket amount as refund. 5) Hotel selection is poor. 3 star hotel but experiences 1 star during the stay. MMT is totally mis managed and dont care for customer. I would always suggest to go to local Travel agency,1
2620,"Horrible bella express at Pattaya. I had booked Thailand holiday through makemytrip and booking ID:Nl2081619939. Three days back i returned back from Thailand. My experience with the hotel bella express at Pattaya, is horrible. It is rated as 3 star by makemytrip, but we really believe it is not fit to rate as even a single star. The rooms are very small and they have accommodated 3 persons in a single room. The staff is very misbehaved and rude, especially a big fat arrogant receptionist who speaks to the customers very arrogantly. But hotel Howard square place is good and up to standard. This is one good thing which happened in the tour. My sincere advice to makemytrip is,  just drop this hotel from booking further.",1
2621,"I booked air ticket (Air India) through MakeMyTrip. I didn't face any problem while booking the ticket and the cost  was few bucks cheaper than what I was getting directly through Air India site. However, the problem in booking through MakemyTrip is that once booked, it is very difficult to change the date of travel or cancel the ticket. In spite of sending repeated emails, I didn't get any response from MakeMyTrip. The only response I got was the automated one. I made many calls to Makemytrip toll free number and every time I was asked to call back after few hours and then the representative disconnects the phone abruptly.",1
2622,"I booked for munnar and alleppy trip.Cab Driver was very rude and not covered the places mmt mentioned in the package.Also, the person who had booked the package never received the call once I transferred the money.

2623,"This is saurabh. This is to bring into all of your notice that, kindly don't make any flight bookings through MakeMyTrip.com as they won't hear you or consider you, even if the problem arises due to a technical reasons and that too from their end. They don't even stand by their logo punch line ""memories unlimited"". This was the first and the last time I have made reservations with makemytrip. Here is a small description to explain why I feel so. For booking a ticket for 3 passengers(myself, my spouse and my daughter), I paid the amount that was displayed in MakeMyTrip website, using my credit card. The transaction took a bit longer time as compared to otherwise, but I waited patiently. After a while I saw a sorry message, saying: Your payment has been processed. However, the system was unable to confirm a part of your booking/passenger. Later when I checked the status in MakeMyTrip website, using Booking ID I was shocked to find that they booked 2 tickets(for myself and my spouse), but not the third one for my daughter and charged amount for 3 tickets. I mean just imagine the type of technology they are using which(as they say in rare occasions), in case of a failure books parents ticket leaving out a 5 year old child on its own. Now since the amount was deducted, I had no other option, but wait as there were chances that I called airline and was told to call MakeMyTrip to get a settlement. I called MakeMyTrip multiple times and tried to get a satisfactory answer, but the effort was in vain. Its very hard to get the same person as they keep transferring the call from one department to the other .In fact I found that they deliberately put you on hold for more than 20+ minutes. In most of the cases they say ""we request you to kindly wait for more 24 working hours and we will get back to you"". But in reality they never call back as, nobody takes ownership on behalf of MakeMyTrip. In one or two calls I realized that they laughed at situation I was in. What a sarcastic way to handle a customer by a leading travel agent who claims to leave ""memories unlimited"". I dropped multiple mails to MakeMyTrip Customer Support email id:service@makemytrip.com, in all the cases I got automated reply mail saying ""Thank you for contacting MakeMyTrip.com. .We will respond to your query within 24 hours."". But in reality they again they never call. I don't understand the fact, that does MakeMyTrip don't have any owner or top most managers to check these kind of complaints and rectify it? Or are they using such a primitive technology that they are not able to manage their business properly and are falling back to such UNETHICAL means. Overall, its an utter chaos. If things go smooth, you might not see much hassles. But the Service quality of an organization shows up when things don’t go as expected and my experience with makemytrip has been horrendous. So please be more careful to all of you while dealing with this fraud company in the future.",1
2624,"Two of us, about 60 years of age booked an international ticket through Makemytrip, the biggest mistake of our life. The schedule was changed by Saudi Airlines with a ridiculously long stop over. We talk to Makemytrip customer service every day for the past 7 days to get them to talk to the airlines about this and get this fixed, but no one has done that yet. It is a call to airlines, which would take at most 5 minutes and they do not have some one to do this? This is RIDICULOUS. Just because we booked our tickets through these guys, we are unable to directly talk to the airlines about this. For anyone out there, if you are looking at booking any travel or hotel, and see a deal of Makemytrip, look it up on makemytrip, but book it directly using the airlines website. If you book through Makemytrip, all you can expect are automated email responses saying that they are working on it and a dumb customer service representative who is worse than those responses.",1
2625,We have booked a package trip of Delhi-Manali-Shimla-Delhi where we will be celebrating our New Year Eve in Shimla confirmed hotel booking by MakeMyTrip. When we arrived at Shimla on 31st night there was no hotel bookings made by MakeMyTrip. As we had the hotel booking confirmation voucher by MakeMyTrip but hotelier did not entertained this as they did not get any information from MakeMyTrip. We were 2500 km away from my hometown not knowing where to go and whom to approach? We were wandering in the cold chilled night with a kid looking out for an accommodation to spend that night. We were fully tired after 10 hours’ drive from Manali to Shimla and MakeMyTrip made us to wander in the ice cold windy night with kid asking for food. There was no support given by MakeMyTrip to us and we were all alone on the lonely roads in the night. Shimla was fully packed that night due to New Year Eve and we could not get accommodation anywhere. We got hold of a broker and somehow got a hotel to stay 30 km away from Shimla. They did not give any written bill or any other facilities than just to spend the night. The worst part is MakeMyTrip denies to refund the amount what I gave on that night to get that hotel. Don't ever rely on MakeMyTrip for any holiday bookings. Don't believe on MakeMyTrip for your hotel bookings and travel. Have a plan B. Best avoid MakeMyTrip. You don't know what pain we have gone through that night where all others are enjoying the New Year party.,1
2626,"BIG NO to makemytrip. No one should ever buy tickets through makemytrip. I made a mistake of buying an International ticket from them with Booking ID(IN1306B6S51413). They changed the flight details without informing us. Incidentally, I came to know about the changes while adding one more passenger to the same booking otherwise we would have missed the flight. Now, from last 5 days I have been calling customer care to issue the new e-ticket but they fail to do so. Travel is in 4 days and I don’t have the tickets. Customer care service is pathetic, they don’t have adequate information on why the tickets are not being issued. they never forward their calls to the floor manager. You can never escalate the issues. Never buy tickets from makemytrip.",1
2627,"My wife and I had pre-booked and paid for a cab with Ola cabs through Make My Trip(MMT) to take us from Mumbai airport to Pune on the 12 November 2013. After having been travelling for nearly 24 hours we arrived at the meeting point at Mumbai airport at exactly the time booked(06:30). We found no one waiting for us and we searched for several minutes. We were approached by a taxi supervisor who offered to make a phone call for us. We called the number of Ola Cabs that we had been given. We were dismayed to be told that no vehicle was available and that we should make other arrangements. When I objected that we had already paid I was told to phone later when the office was open. Having been travelling for so long I had no choice but to take another taxi at Rs 5000. Later that day telephone calls to Ola Cabs and MMT resulted in promises to call us back. There then continued until the beginning of January an exchange of telephone calls and E mails with the explanation changing every time.This exchange resulted in both Ola cabs and MMT admitting that the driver was not at the meeting place at the time agreed. These companies refused me a refund because the driver entered the distant car park only 8 minutes after the agreed time  and I should have known where he was and have found him! I did in fact check the meeting point before we left a total of 25 minutes after the agreed time. No one has yet explained who told me that no car was available. This is the most important question as it forced me to spend an unnecessary Rs 5000. In addition, this incident was my fault because coming from France, I had the audacity not to have an Indian mobile phone! A fact that I made very clear at the time of booking. In short, if you use Make My Trip or Ola cabs, be prepared to suffer for any of their errors as they will support each other to the detriment of the customer and on no account, pay in advance.",1
2628,"Very bad exp with Make my trip. I am sorry to say that we had a bad experience.  The rooms were booked for Sai Seema- Shirdi but when we reached there,  we were told that MMT has overbooked and that there were no rooms available.  We were then shifted to a new hotel that was a few blocks away.  We were in hurry to go for darshan so did not want to argue with the hotel staff nor had the time to call MMT. The hotel was decent but had no kitchen.  For a cup of tea also we had to step out of the hotel. Sorry to say but MMT doesn't really bother about its customers.  I had heard n read about people facing such issues with MMT but faced it this time.  Your services are bad.  And believe me,  if I write a mail to your customer service office I will get a blatant reply that refund will not be possible.  As if I am asking for it. Hotel Name:Hotel Sai Seema, Shirdi. Booking ID:NH210606569912 Its been five days I sent you people a mail. Not a single reply. Advice to others: Never opt for them. All bookings at are your risk. Am yet to see a worse service provider than make my trip I wish there was an option to give zero stars. Gunjan",1
2629,Worst website to book your tickets. Worst customer support. In my booking I had connect flight. When made reservation I got all tickets and paid. Later I see that the booking was made for round trip but ticket to go from my destination to connecting airport is not booked. Very disappointed with the service and sense less booking system. Book directly on the airline websites instead of this crappy website.,1
2630,"I was trying to book domestic flight on makemytrip. They have an option to redeem payback points under'Discount & Loyalty points' section after you select the flight schedule but before you decide or buy tickets. If you use payback number, whether you buy tickets or not your points gets redeemed automatically! Now you have no other way but end up buying tickets only at makemytrip and that too the discount coupon applies only to domestic tickets. Now, the condition of using coupon: One e-coupon is valid only against a single purchase/transaction of domestic flight ticket at MakeMyTrip.com. E-coupon code is not refundable, exchangeable, transferable or redeemable for cash. No extension of validity will be allowed. So, in essence if you by mistake use payback number, whether you buy the tickets or not, they will take your redeemed points and keep it with them. They won't inform you on this any where while booking tickets. Its complete cheating on their part.",1
2631,"This was my first(and probably the last) experience with Make My Trip tour organizing team. I have never come across such irresponsible professional anywhere else in the corporate world. We had booked an organized trip to Andaman Islands for 17 family members(including 7 children) through Make My Trip. Here is a gist of what we went through on this vacation. The trip was a disaster from Day-1 where we stayed in “Marine View” hotel. We were asked to leave the hotel at 7 in the morning as this is supposed to be hotel check out time. MMT team had informed us that they would come at 9.30 AM to pick us up for our next destination and we assumed that we could stay in hotel till that time. No one from MMT team bothered to inform us about checking out at 7 AM and worst of all there was no alternate arrangement for us to go to any other place at that time. On contacting MMT team, we got a standard response that they will get back to us shortly. We had a very heated argument with the Hotel Management team and literally fought with them to give us some more time as all of us had just woken up and were not ready to leave immediately. During this entire episode no-one from MMT came to hotel to  talk to Hotel Management. Worst was in-store when we reached Havlock Island on Day-3. As per confirmation from MMT our booking was with “Holiday Inn” resort for 2 days however the local logistics guy representing MMT took us to a different hotel. Upon requesting him that we would like to stay in the hotel where we have our booking, his cold response was “I don’t know anything. There is no other hotel available in Havlock right now and you will have to stay here”. He washed off his hands immediately from this situation and even abused MMT lot of times for putting him in such awkward position. We then contacted our tour coordinator to look into the situation. She told us to contact another local coordinator. He spoke to us for a minute saying that he will call back and as expected he never called back. Here we were, Seventeen of our family members(including 7 children) standing on the road after a long and tiring day hoping to get some rest in anticipation of the next day activities but MMT had different things in store for us. Finally after 3 long hours of wait when we didn’t get any response from MMT we had to give-in and checked in a different hotel that night. Our entire evening was wasted arguing with local logistics guy and trying to speak to MMT team. Not to mention the agony of resort that was not facing the beach(original booking was in a beach side resort). Sorry, but it’s not over yet in Havlock saga as there were more surprises in store. After checking in the hotel, the local logistics guy told us that we have to check out next morning as rooms in this hotel have been booked only for one night. When we asked him, where will we stay next day, his responses was “I don’t know”. Everyone was tensed through the night as we didn’t know where to go in the morning. At 8 AM in the morning our luggage was thrown on the road in front of the hotel as Hotel staff refused to keep the luggage in cloak room. Even at this point MMT team was not sure about where we would stay on that night. We requested local logistics guy to keep our luggage was kept in a vehicle till we come back from activities in the evening. Finally we got a room in the evening which was of course different from where we had our original booking. Is it a general practice at Make My Trip to harass your customers like this? Are they a small roadside organization who doesn't have any Customer focus and always happy with their ""Chalta Hai"" attitude?",1
2632,"I am a relatively patient guy who generally does not write bad reviews giving products / services the benefit of the doubt, but what I experienced with Makemytrip is something I just cannot comprehend and, I believe every one who is thinking about doing business with MMT(makemytrip.com) should read about this before moving forward. I am based in the US and getting married in about a month's time in India. Me and my fiancee decided that since we will be moving back to the US immediately after the marriage, there is no point in going for a honeymoon, but I decided to surprise her with a small honeymoon package. So, I went online to look for destinations / hotels / flights / packages and eventually stumbled upon MMT which is India's ""No 1"" travel site. Don't get me wrong, I think the site definitely has the potential and the right idea. I decided to go with a honeymoon package of my choosing and booked it(note that I paid the whole amount immediately since I am getting married in a month so, taking chances at this point is not a good idea). Once I booked the tickets, I got an email from MMT ""MakeMyTrip.com holidays package booking confirmation"" and it said in ""Confirmation voucher"" with the following text - ""This is a booking confirmation only. Your vouchers will be sent 72 hours after booking."" I wasn't entirely sure what this meant(since I paid the whole amount, but I assumed that I would be mailed some more details in a few days). Eventually, a day or so later, I got a call from a Sr. Executive asking for the details of my fiancee. I asked the person, is the booking confirmed? Are there any issues, he said no, everything is fine and he will email me the hotel check-in / check-out details, pick-up, etc and all that jazz in a short while. Learning this, I went ahead and booked the flights(from akbartravelsonline.com since the flights were actually cheaper there than MMT). About 12 hours fast-forward, he sends an email saying sorry, the dates you requested aren't available with the hotel! And I said, but I paid the whole amount and it was all booked and confirmed, he made some excuse as to why the hotel is unavailable(which was probably a valid reason), nonetheless he said if you want, you have the options of preponing, postponing or cancel the hotel booking. I asked him for alternatives in the similar range and he said he will get back to me. Another about 12 hours later(I have no idea why it takes them this much time to check booking info), he said equivalent hotels are booked during those dates so, my only options were to cancel(since preponing / postponing weren't possible because of the tight schedule of the marriage, visas, traveling back to US). He tells me that please wait another 24 - 48 hours to try and get the booking at the hotel which I requested which was fine by my, but since most other hotels were already booked, I was worried I will probably end up not getting anything so, I asked for alternative options(no options were provided and he said don't worry, let me try). I asked to speak with his manager about alternative destinations and what to do with the flight tickets which I already booked, he said his manager is in a meeting and will get back to me in a few minutes. Few hours later, I call him again and he says his manager is again in a meeting and will call back once he gets out and he was still ""trying"" to get my booking. At this point, it seemed highly unlikely to me that MMT will do anything about this. So, I went ahead with booking a different location(not from MMT because frankly, I doubt I will ever trust what guys from MMT say) along with the flights. Next day, I call him again(even though he said he will call me) and I ask him about the details of the hotel, he says, can you wait another 24 hours. I again request to speak with the manager and he says he hasn't come in yet(it was about 11.30 AM IST). He said his manager comes in between 12 - 12.30 IST and said he will give me a call once his manager arrives. As you would have guessed, there was no call and waited until 1 PM IST. Eventually I gave him a call and he said his manager will take 5 minutes so, he will call back in 5 minutes. I wait for another half hour and at about 1.30 PM, I call again, eventually to get hold of the manager. The manager told me that getting that hotel is not an option and if I cannot postpone / prepone, cancellation is the only option. At this point, I tell him about the flights and I would incur a lose of at least Rs. 10, 000 and he says, sorry but he cannot do anything about it. The system showed the the hotel was available for those dates but, apparently that wasn't the case. After explaining him the situation for a while, he understands that it was probably a mistake on MMTs part to confirm to me that the booking was already done, he told me that he is speak with a different MMT department and try to get me the lose I am incurring(on top of cancelling and giving me the full refund of the amount I paid for the hotel bookings). He told me when he call me again to confirm that. I said any time after 8 PM(which would be 6.30 AM where I was since it was already after 1 AM for me). He said he will definitely call me at 8 PM without fail. At this point, I was extremely glad since all in all even though, I lost a lot of time and it was a hassle, system errors do happen, but what happened this was just really annoying. During the night, I got a call from them 5 times(note that this was all before 6.30 AM) even though I told them to call after 6.30 AM. I eventually called them back around 6.15 AM(even my mom doesn't call me those many times during the night) concerned and some different guy picks up the phone and says that the manager is out and will call back within the hour. As you can guess, there was no phone call within the hour. I called after a couple of hours, and all I heard was random TV noises on the other side. I emailed the manager about calling back and did not get any response. All in all, the way things are handled at MMT is just horrible. Horrendous customer service with bunch of false promises. No sense of empathy for the customer. I hope you think better before doing business with them. I know I will never book anything from Makemytrip.",1
2633,"Initially, I had a conversation with makemytrip guys and felt good with their customization and options. Then booked tour and paid total amount on the same day. and these guys did a good follow up till I made the payment. Now its already 5 days. but till now i didn't receive my complete confirmed itinerary, and whenever I call these customer service center guys, they keep on transferring the call to other guys.

2634,"This is Rabia and I have gone to makemytrip to book a holiday,  Firstly, its very hard to get the same person as they keep transferring the call from one department to the other. Secondly, nobody takes ownership. As I am writing this feedback 15 hrs before my travel, I still don’t have e-tickets and hotel vouchers with me. On top of this, they wanted me to bear the cost of the hotel stay. Overall, its an utter chaos with holiday packages. If things go smooth, you might not see much hassles. But the Service quality of an organization shows up when things don’t go as expected and my experience with makemytrip has been horrendous.",4
2635,"Makemytrip.com - an unprofessional, negligent and unorganized company. Never go for bookings with makemytrip. Had a disastrous holiday to kerala 5N6D the booking for which was made thro makemytip.  Listing down a few below: They are a set of cheaters. They cancel bookings at the last moment even though you have confirmed bookings. They provide you alternate bookings which are not upto the mark. whats the use of booking in advance? Its very difficult to talk to makemytrip representatives. You will need to spend atleast 30 mins everytime you want to talk to them. Worst service - MMT says its a 5 star property but in reality its not even a 2 -start property. Looting people in public. They don't make  payments to the hotel/property owner and without confirmation they send vouchers to us. So you end up travelling there and get to know your booking is not there. Pathetic. You try to complain MMT, they close the case saying resolved without providing any resolution. Overall, I don't recommend MMT to anyone as they will spoil your vacation and they don't seem to take things for granted .",1
2636,"This is regarding the Kerala package booked with Make my trip for the month of december. I would like to highlight few points regarding the service/ assistance provided on this trip: 1) The package was booked on 28th Oct, 2013 and payment(Rs. 30, 267/-)was made thereof . It was an individual package . Once the package was booked, the seller( Mr. Manmohan Singh- manmohan.singh@makemytrip.com, phone number- 9560172577) stopped taking / responding to calls / mails .I  wanted to change the check in time in the hotel( 1 p.m.) since the flight was  landing in Kochi @ 9. After several attempts(call / mails to Mr. Manmohan Singh) finally, I myself called the customer care and got the check in time changed. 2) At the time of booking(28th Oct), we were promised a cash back for making the entire payment through HDFC credit card in one single installment but to our dismay, now they deny any such promise. 3) The cab vendor(Tokyo Travels)(booked by make my trip) did not make proper arrangements even after arrival at Kochi . I called the cab vendor after landing in Kochi(he was intimated on call previously as well) to share the details of the driver so that his name  & phone number can be cross- verified but even after waiting for half an hour same was not shared. Ultimately, we were forced to rely completely on cab driver who approached us. 4) The cab driver did not have the copy of the itinerary. The cab driver was rude and did not know both Hindi and English which led to a lot of communication problem. Also he refused to go for half of the sight-seeing stating that the itinerary has not been prepared in an unorganized manner and it is not possible to cover them. The cab tyres were almost flat, not at all appropriate for driving on hilly areas. Attaching pictures for same. 5) The hotels were not comparable to three star hotels, specially, one given at Munnar - Green Mansion. The hotel was no more than a lodge . The room was damp, pillows and roof had fungus, wall plaster coming off, limited food option, (2-3 dishes in dinner, 1 dish in breakfast – that too stale, hand- written menu, water problem in the bathroom). The hotel provided at Thekkady- Windhaven resort was also a sub-standard one. 6) We were made to pay for some of the sight- seeing even if same were to be paid/ provided for by make my trip as mentioned in the itinerary. 7) While booking the package, Make my trip officials lied for the charges for sight-seeing. On call it was clearly told that all the sight-seeing will not cost more than 1300 to 1400  for two while it costed us much more than that. Make my trip has not lived up to its expectations . Their  tag line “Memories Unlimited” justifies their way of doing business by leaving people only with uncountable negative and bad memories.",1
2637,"Avoid using make my trip otherwise you will spoil your vacations/travel. It has worst customer care. They are just middleman and makes commission and will leave you in middle somewhere.

But I got a call on 28th when I was already in Pune, which was unknown city that MakeMyTrip.com can not provide me cab now and I have to be at my own.  I went for vacation to enjoy but It turned out to be last minute nightmare for me and my family as I did not know anybody in Pune and I had very less time available. I used MakeMytrip.com for my booking and they are making an excuse that it was vendor mistake and I should talk to Vendor, It is not correct.If I have paid money to MakeMyTrip.com then why should I go and talk to the vendor ? If I cancel my booking within 24 hrs, as per policy on their website, I will not get any money back. But if MakemyTrip cancels without any reason, they will not pay any penalty!!

2638,"It seems I am not the only one who has been a target of unethical business practise from makemytrip.com. I made family reservations with Makemytrip to travel from US to India for Christmas holidays, these reservation were made well in advance. (4 1/2 months prior to travel date) Original online flight details 1 1/2 hr, transit in London, return 8 hr 15 min layover in London, ticket price$1245.00 per passenger. As soon as I try to confirm this booking, makemytrip.com travel agent calls me and offers an option for my return flight making and informs me if I take this option my layover in London would be only 3 hours, and I will not require a transit visa for London. She further informs me any layover in London which is over 8 hrs requires a transit visa. She also mentioned this option will cost me $50 extra per passenger and my return flight from UK to US will be to a different airport, to which I accepted this option and paid additional $50, and also made rent a car reservations from the different airport. All said and done on the day of travel we go to the airport and the airline Denies boarding because my wife does not have a transit Visa for UK, (WHICH AS I REMEMBERED WE DID NOT NEED AS PER MAKEMYTRIP.COM TRAVEL AGENT), with no other choice we had to come back home to try and find out what went wrong. Now 15 days have passed and there has not been a single day I have not spent few hours with makemytrip.com travel agents trying to tell me it is my fault and I have to re-book with change date penalty and fare difference. In this past 15 days I have had Makemytrip travel agents tell me they will review the telephonic recording when the reservations were done and if their agent has made this mistake they will refund my money. The latest is they will extract the recording and all of us will get on a conference call and listen to what transpired between the travel agent and me. But now I have been told makemytrip.com does not have any tools to extract this recording hence there is no option but to pay the change date fee & the fare difference. THERE WILL BE NO REFUND. My question to them is why has it taken them 15 days to find out they did not have the tolls to extract the recording. Also if the travel agent did not have the proper knowledge about the transit visa requirements she should not have given us this assurance of not requiring a transit visa if the layover is less than 8 hours in London. As for my wife there was no way we were going to leave her stranded at an airport with no confirmed booking for future travel. I believe Makemytrip unethically sold us an option which was not a valid option, which in turn resulted our family not being able to travel to India which in turn made us loose our bookings in India for travel to Goa & Rajasthan. MAKEMYTRIP should either change our dates for future travel without any penalties or refund our money.",1

2641,"Worst customer care support, minimum 30 minutes to wait for talk with any person I need to change the date of my ticket which was not possible through online due to the refund polices of the airline, as per the instruction shows on the screen I called to their number  0124-4628747 on 23/12/2013 at 7:45 pm and after 20 minutes of waiting time I got connected to one person and updated that they are not able to check the details since their system is down and requested me to call after 30 minutes, Again after 30 minutes I called - this time calls connected after 35 minutes of waiting time - and when I asked why waiting time. They simply told due to high call volumes and I asked will your company pay the money for my time? He simply disconnected the call. Since no option left for me I again called.this time it took nearly 25 minutes to get connected, After that they told to make the difference of the amount along with their huge server charge of Rs 250(no service given) and once the payment has been done call back again to book the ticket.i told them to hold the line while making the payment in between my mobile balance got empty and call disconnected. Once again I need to start the marathon.Again called and.as usual it took 25 minutes to get connected.and now I have been holding for last 15 minutes for the final confirmation on phone.Now the time is 10:54 pm.i don't know how long they are going to take more, by the time flight availability might have changed.

2643,"Hello, I booked this trip with MMT executive Mr.Abhinav Mathur and explained to him very clearly over the telephone and via an email that I need a decent and secured place to stay as me and my sister are traveling and our security and comfort is of utmost importance. I had paid total of Rs.65, 000 for 2 nights in Munnar and 1 night in Alleppy as I was told by your executive Mr.Abhinav that the hotels that he is recommending are of 4 star rating. First hotel that we stayed in for 2 nights - Ambaddy Estate.This hotel is not even 2 star if you personally go and see their kitchen, infrastructure and food quality. They do not have proper lighting where people can sit and enjoy nature.After 5pm it was pitch dark and scary to even venture out of our room. The food was stale and over over priced. The bucket in the bathroom was leaking. Breakfast no variety at all. And to top it all this was more for honeymoon couple and not family at all. What on earth was your executive Mr Abhinav was thinking to recommend this place for two sisters. We were literally locked inside our room for 2 nights as we could not even venture out after 5pm. I was at this hotel/cottage from 10th Dec.13 to 11th Dec, 13. Makemytrip recommended me and my sister this hotel stating that it is of 4 star standard. Please believe me that this is not even 2 star. Their kitchen is dirty and filthy. Infrastructure is very very poor, there are no lights around and it becomes pitch dark after 5pm. The place is very sloppy and not advisable for elderly people or children as a little slip and one is down the valley. There is no security and the place is very very deserted and scary. There is no recreation at all in and around and one cannot even come out of the room after 5pm as it is dark, slippery and creepy. The food is not fresh (one can understand as it is so much on height) and it is over over priced. We were forced to stay there for 2 scary nights (thanks to the poor service of Makemytrip) and we had to order food from a little far away restaurant - Misty Mountain (which is far better than Ambady Estate in terms of tariff, food and facilities). They charge Rs.400 for a small piece of fish, Rs.250 for club sandwich, Rs.50 for water bottle-way to highly priced for their standards. No facilities at all-just cottages which is only and only good for honeymooners or people who want to be closed in a room. The rooms also does not have ceiling fan but a table fan. So though it is on height, early morning around 6am you start feeling hot and sweaty as the table fan air does not reach the bed and the sunlight come through the window pane. Overall really horrible and Makemytrip really cheaters who have executive who are liars and have no sense or clue as to what is 4 star and 2 star. First day itself I called Mr Abhinav from Munnar mentioning the concerns. Instead of understanding and empathizing with us he was just going on arguing and playing blame game at our cost. To top it all he calls the resort (Ambaddy Estate) manager Mr Shyam and tells him a lie that we have some family emergency back at home and hence we want to check out. All this without our knowledge. I feel really cheated and overcharged by your executive who planned and drafted the whole package. It was a big mistake of mine to trust your executive and your company. I was getting the same deal from another company for less Rs.500. But still I went ahead and booked it with Makemytrip thinking you are known for quality and honesty. I will never ever deal with you and also discourage my relatives and friends from doing so. REALLY PATHETIC AND I WILL ALSO PUT THE SAME FEEDBACK ON VARIOUS WEBSITE SO THAT PEOPLE DO NOT GET CHEATED LIKE ME. Regards, Maggie. 9820662338.",1
2644,"Make my trip.com –cheats. Please do not deal with Makemy trip. We were cheated by these so called travel agency. Their slogans & advertisement are fancy and not their commitment. We booked our trip to Rajasthan through Make my trip, “customized package” and not their “budget package” and they had charged hefty amount for our hotel stay in Jaipur & Jodhpur. Unfortunately they put us in sub-substandard hotels in both the places specially the hotel in Jodhpur – with rickety lift, which was surrounded with paan spit on the exterior of the lift, room allotted to us did not have the grills on the window exposing us to all dangers and we had cockroaches & lizards roaming freely in the room. Breakfast in both the hotels was a complete letdown. On return when we brought this to the notice of Makemytrip, they confirmed their shortcomings and agreed to reimburse for the “Deficiency in service” that was way back on 22nd Oct-2013 (we have chain of emails in which Makemytrip has confirmed the deficiency in service as well and agreed to pay us compensation) however in-spite of repeated reminders they have not bothered to reply to our emails nor have they sent the cheque to-date. Hence I am cautioning all the customers to keep away from dealing with such travel agency who do not believe in customer service and cheat gullible customers. Regards, K.V.Amarnath.",1

2646,"It doesn't matter even if the website is good. People behind it is important. Pathetic experience with them.  Cheating customers for money. I am staying in the US for sometime and I booked round trip tickets through travel agent for my family to travel from India. For several reasons(Bad weather, child health, traffic jam etc.) I couldn't make it to the airport on time. This can happen to anyone. I called my agent and requested for the next available date to travel and was ready to pay penalty and fare difference. Agent says that dates cant be changed after no show and also money is not refundable. I am not asking to refund the ticket/Money, I am requesting for date change. I don't see ""Date change is not possible after no show"" in any form of agent communication during ticket booking. Agent knows that I am not informed about it. Agent claims that British airways is not changing the dates, so I can't do it. I don't know what is going on there. I am not able to talk to British Airways for the same reason because they are asking for the agent code to proceed further and asking me to contact Agent for any information. I requested the Agent a lot and spent a lot of time. But the agent is not ready to help in any way. I paid $3000+ for round ticket.Now I am not able to change travel dates and can't make use of the return ticket as well. I have seen the similar situations before with my friends and many others. No one had a similar issue, Somehow, everyone had got different travel date with their agents or airlines.My friends are surprised to know my situation and the way Makemytrip is responding. Don't recommend makemytrip. Stay away from it.",1
2647,"Went to the Andamans for a 6D5N trip. A lot of reviews about MakeMyTrip was bad, but still this seemed to be the cheapest one. So went ahead and booked the vacation with them. The advantages I saw booking with them: Cheaper than if booked individually. In fact, for me the total package(inclusive of round trip air tickets from Chennai) cost me 28K/head. Where as if I had booked the same flight tickets and resorts, the cost would have bee around 48K/head. This was mainly due to their bargaining. They had made a good plan to make sure we covered maximum places. No headaches of traveling in and around the city to see places. They arranged a dedicated tempo for us. They would carry our check in luggage. So no headaches there too. Good restaurants and resorts selected. Very friendly and helpful guides and managers.

I had said him to drop me at airport. He had refused & abused me. I was with my family at the time. It was 4:30 am in morning. I had called MMT customer care and put a complaint. MMT executive had suggested me to go to airport and make full payment. They had told me that I have to pay full payment including extra miles which cab had driven. He told me that they will be refund that extra money. I was getting late so I had put that complaint and go to airport. I had paid the full amount to the cab driver. I had also asked him for invoice but he had refused. Any one from MMT had not contacted me after this. I had made a written complaint and emailed to cab provider/MMT. Now MMT has contacted me but refused to refund my extra money because they are saying we are not cab owner. They are also saying that cab vendor are not in touch. MMT asking me for the bill, which their cab driver had not given to me. I am very puzzled and request you all to not use MMT services. Please check my attached pictures also.",1
2649,Easy change of ticket took 6 calls and total hold time of 2 hours. At at the end I had to call the airlines to make the ticket changes. The customer service sucks at Makemytrip. Will never book again through them. I spoke to at least 6 different customer reps and each time had to explain my situation from the scratch. None of them had any information about the previous rep's actions. Makemytip is big on promises on their websites but poor delivery and post sales support.,1

2651,"Worst ever customer service from Makemytrip. I requested for a small change in my itinerary with booking ID IN1311B2S098154 and that customer supprt guy was furious and rude in his behavior questioning me why I needed to change it, and told it cannot be cancelled, and solely due to his behavior, I had to cancel the entire itinerary and I lost my 20% deposit amount of Rs. 8400 as well as he said its not refundable, whereas his original email when intimating about the package said ""If we cancel within 44-31 days, 50% of the amount will be refunded"".

2653,"Have been a MMT customer for more than 10 years and the experience has always been great. However, last one year of follow up with MMT has really left me disappointed. I had 2 bookings made at Makemytrip for travel in March 2020 with trip for GoAir flight booking from Mumbai to Goa for 4 passengers spending Rs.10392 and for Air India flight booking from Mumbai to Goa for 3 passengers spending Rs.4142. Due to Covid, the flights did not operate and I understand the refund has been issued by the respective airlines to MMT. However MMT is not following the due diligence in crediting the amount back to the customers. I have been following up and lodged several complaints with MMT in the app or email with no response whatsoever until early this year. Around March 2021, they responded saying the refund is processed in the wallet which did show up. There was an option to transfer the money to original payment mode which I opted for, but it seems according to MMT, there is a ""Technical"" error due to which the payment could not be processed. There was an option to provide bank details which I opted, but to complete the same, we have to input an OTP which is never received or may be MMT doesn't send it at all. I tried this for about 2 months. Lastly as I was not getting OTP again, used the option to transfer the wallet amount to original payment mode. This time the money went from my wallet, but it never reached my account. It is more than 3 months, every complaint registered by me is closed by MMT without any response. MMT is available for taking fresh bookings, but their customer care team is not available to respond to queries like this. I am avoiding any fresh booking with MMT and would like to advise anyone who reads this to avoid MMT altogether or govt should take action.",1

We have met some travelers which have booked the hotels from you, and got some very good hotels at Munnar and Thekkady at the same price which he have booked the package. We are really disappointed with the hotels. We have enjoyed only the car services provided by you. Please make sure that your agents do not provide these hotels to other customers.",3
2655,The fundamental problem is they don't have a clue about what they are selling! So they are just agents or brokers like any other travel agency! So say the book a hotel for you in any unknown place for you in India. You have no idea what kind of place or value you will be getting which is usually true if even if you book directly. But guess what in most cases Makemytrip charges 20-30% more than direct booking or showing up at the hotel. In some cases up to twice the price.,1

Simple bus booking took 15 minutes. and it failed. Call them and find their system under updation . Call again after 1 hour, same thing.

2657,"My recent trip to Shimla and Manali was not up-to expectations. There were many simple things that 'makemytrip' did not take care of. We were given 2 star hotel in the name of 3 star (hotel Silverine - Shimla) . The hotel manager himself confirmed it to be a 2 star hotel. Of course if you see their kitchen and small restaurant, it is pretty well understood that no one will rate it above 1 star and not even that. It was a 6 days trip and we were in Innova which had already run 3 lakhs kilometers and was making all sort of noise through out our journey. When it rained, water was dripping inside the vehicle. The driver kept on taking to his desired place so that he can eat commission and when I complained to 'makemytrip' during the journey, no action was taken against him. The result was we could not complete our itinerary. Are these three points sufficient to spoil your entire holiday which a family keeps on waiting that comes only once in a year?",1
2658,"Recently I took a holiday package from MakeMyTrip( MMT), the booking( my first and last booking from MMT) was done 90 days in advance considering the Dussehra rush, the customer care executiveSwetha Ravishankarwas very helpful until I made the payment, she promised she will take care of all bookings including hotel, taxi etc., replied to all my emails within hours; I thought I chose the right travel agency for my holiday trip. To my surprise everything turned negativeonce I made the full payment. One week before my trip got a call from MMT customer care, sayingmy bookingin Bhoomi Residency( Agra)has been cancelledas the Government sealed that hotel! I called Swetha but she said there is no change in booking. I was not happy with her answer, took the hotel number from internet and checked with them directly. I got the answer that the hotel is not in operation. This time I called MMTcustomer care, I got the reply that I have tocheck-in in Bhoomi Residency but stay in another hotel(!) . I was totally frustrated, I called Swetha again, this time she said she will check and call me back before 5PM. I waited till 5, no call from Swetha, around 5: 15 I called her again, she asked for 30 more minutes. I waited till 6, no call from Swetha. I called again but no one picked the call. Next day again I tried but no response. I called customer care, they were helpless. Raised a complaint on their website, no action. I had to travel with my family, I will be in deep trouble if something goes wrong, but since I already made the payment( MMT offersonly partial refund) decided to take risk( during my trip I went to the first hotel, then they guided me to another hotel which was around 5KM away) . Till the day before my trip I did not have the car detail in which I will be travelling all 6 days. I did not contact Swetha as she already decided not to help. From Customer care I got the car voucher, but the pickup time was mentioned as 12AM. I asked the customer care executive to change it to match my flight arrival time, he put me on hold and tried to contact the car vendor, after few minutes he said the vendor is not picking his call and asked me to contact them directly(!) . Hell, is this for what I paid MMT? Later I called the car vendor and fixed the time my own. The hotel MMT booked for me in Delhi( The Pearl - A Royal Residency) was supposed to be 3 star but in actual it is 1, dirty smelly place in a congested area. Read my review about this hotel in TripAdvisor http: //bit.ly/HnQj9c. So my advise to the readers is: never book holiday trips from MakeMyTrip, better plan your own holiday which will help you save money and also will award memorable holidays. First prepare an itinerary with the help of wikitravel( or use the one in MMT); second book hotels via popular hotel booking sites( you will get cheaper rates there); third book a local taxi via the hotel( MMT is also doing the same) or Google for local tour operators. We are choosing package tour to avoid all these headaches but if we are not getting what we have paid for, no point in going with these kinds of lazy irresponsible operators.",1
2659,"My terrible experience in short.14265 Booked a Room in Hotel Pearl, Kolhapur for 2 days. Paid Rs Rs 14265 and got a CONFIRMED room. Reached the hotel within 3 hours or so. To our shock, there is no room available. After long fight, they provided room in nearby hotel. Extended the stay in the other hotel for one day and the rate(including everything) came out to be 5874(Have receipt with me) Asked MMT for the refund of difference 14265  -(2 x 5874)  =  Rs 2517 and compensation for all the trouble. Made a compaint and it took almost one week for them to give final reply. Quoting the email - ""With reference to your e-mail regarding the Booking ID NH210285537634, we regret to inform you that as per the revert received from the higher authority department, we have provided to you alternate hotel option due to rooms were not available in Hotel Pearl. Hence, we regret to inform you that the refund of the fare difference amount cannot be processed."" OHHH. so they say since they provided another cheaper room instead of my confirmed room, the fare difference amount cannot be processed. How is that? They took the money, provided a cheaper room of their choice after all the fights, and asked me to go to hell! They will keep my hard earned money, simply for no reason. Anyone thinking about using this portal, please don't do that. There are far better travel sites with some integrity, I believe. Now I am going to process the credit chararge back in FULL. Prove to my bank that you provided me the service I paid for. At least, I am lucky that I used credit card and I can charge back. For the corporate response team, please explain this nonsense. If I pay you 100 rs for a product of my choice, can you simply pay me something worth 50 rs and ask me to go to hell? Not acceptable. Never, ever.",1

I am promised a call back 3 days ago which I never receive. I call up today again and there is no supervisor available. After waiting for some time and repeated back and forth someone called Amit is the so called supervisor comes on line who is more rude, clueless and thinks he is doing a favor on the customers and talking to him is a worse experience than the agent name Deepak. What kind of a service is this? Explanation given for no call back is that we facing a heavy call volume, ask them then why do you promise a call back answer is an apology. When I said what is the use of apologizing if you cannot offer me a resolution that was the most shocking response saying what do you want me to do then? Really! Shut shop if apology is all you can do without offering a resolution! Are you guys intentionally avoiding talking to customers? Pathetic customer service. Do you think you guys are doing some favor on your customers? Horrified with the kind of service and the responses. Biggest mistake of my life of having booked with Make My Trip.",1

Please donot expect any help from the customer service representative and from their superiors. Even the website of the company does not provide you with correct information. This is what happened with me. There was a slight error in my reservation. I approached the customer service of Makemytrip.com for help. The customer service representative told me straight that he cannot do anything but I have to cancel the reservation and make new reservation. Then I asked him how much refund amount I will get after cancellation. He told me the refund amount that was more than what I paid for the reservation. I brought this error to his attention. After noticing the error, he told me that why did I want to cancel the tickets and offered me help to do something to rectify the reservation. He placed me on hold for few minutes and then told me again to cancel it. I then pressed the cancellation button on the website and it showed me the same wrong amount. When I told him that, he asked to refresh the screen and it still showed me the wrong refund amount. I got little upset and told customer service that when I first requested him to help me correct the error in the tickets, he simply declined my request and asked me to cancel the tickets. When I brought to his attention the error in the refund amount and he saw an error as well in the system, he offered me help to rectify the errors in the tickets, instead of cancelling. I then requested Makemy trip.com to refund me the complete amount because it is an error in their system and I should not be penalized for the mistake that system has committed. I spoke to customer service representative and their supervisor 6 times over a period of 2 weeks for the refund of the complete amount. Every time, I talked to them, they just kept asking for 3 more days and after 2 weeks, they simply told me that everything is right on their part and full money won't be refunded. During the telephonic discussions, the customer service representative denied the existence of their supervisor and colleagues. Every time I talked to them, I took a full note of the name of the person with the spelling as was told to me by the person. In one of my calls, I was told by the customer service that they have listened to my telephonic conversation and there is no person with the name exist in their organization. The customer service even lies about their name when they start talking to you. So that if there arises any issues in the future and you give them the reference of the person in makemytrip, they can easily deny the existence of that person. If you can learn from my experience, never make any reservation from this fraudulent company.

Booking bus and cabs are worst, they dont even check the availability with the vendors and they blindly make you to do the payment. Later they return telling that sorry tickets are not available not your amount will be refunded. none of the numbers they mention in the mail or the message will be answered after booking. no extensions work after they come to know that there is a problem. there is a hell lack of co-ordination between the MMT team mates.. they don't know what's happening in the case ID. REFUND :7 working days.. is 700 days for you. Cost : are more CRAP : MMT charges more than the vendors themselves I GUESS :@.. the same booking ( bus, resort , cab) costed me just half of what I paid MMT, whereas from MMT I had to bare the cancellation penalty also .. !! i would suggest to public to make MMT learn a lesson by just collecting info from them reg the booking and get the deal done directly with the vendors so that your money will be super saved and vendors can also have their Bread. It was totally a bad time for me with these stupid dealers. Overall .. : MMT is a crap ! MMT when are you planning to improve ?",1
2668,"I booked my bus tickets from makemytrip.com for Ebus for New Delhi to Lucknow Volvo 2x2. Bus was scheduled at 10:00 PM. We waited from 10:00 PM till 12 AM and then we were informed that our bus was finally there. We were surprised to see a non-AC bus. We said that we were booked in Volvo 2x2. We were asked how we could say that. Where was it mentioned in our ticket that it was Volvo? They were calling non-Ac bus AC bus. They were not even giving us refund. To our surprise, other passengers agreed to go on that non-AC bus thinking they will get refund. Thankfully, I was and my family were able to travel on another bus of different company on same ticket. Never book bus tickets online. Never.",1

Their customer service sucks.and their employees have grudges against each other and try to use customers as the firing guns.one of them did some goof up in my booking and the other who was actually dealing with me for the payment process asked me to shoot out an escalation against the one who goofed up.I out of innocence did that only to realize later that this was their internal game and we were used for that.MMT fell to such unprofessionalism. Today the truth is most ppl have actually started avoiding MMT and using D Pauls, SOTC(really good), etc.On an international holiday, while others guide you on currency exchange.MMT is one that backs out loud and clear stating we are can't guide you much on this.There should be a zero star rating also, and I tell you most travelers would actually award it a zero and not a 1. I seriously pray this company closes in future.",1
2675,"I find the interface very comfortable and fast. It is easy to see the fares on various dates and airlines. The one-click booking works like a charm. Till two months back I would have given it five stars. Thanks to my evangelism most of my corporate group uses it as their primary travel agent. On September 5th, 2013 I tried to make a booking on MakeMyTrip. The site debited my account for Rs. 20, 000 but told me my ticket was not booked due to some technical glitch and that it would refund my money in two working days. It so happened that at that time I did not have enough money in my account to book fresh tickets and just wait for the refund. So I called up MakeMyTrip customer care and asked them to resolve the issue because my trip was urgent and I had no immediate means to make the booking. Previously, when I had booking failures because my money could not be debited, MakeMyTrip customer care called me and helped me make the booking through IVR and other alternatives and made it a very pleasant experience, so I had complete confidence that they would sort out the problem in good order. If the ticketing issue was due to a sudden increase in price I even offered to pay the difference. However, MakeMytrip told me that if I wanted to book tickets I would have to make a fresh booking and pay the entire amount while the already debited amount could only be refunded through due process a few days later. I spent a fair amount of time requesting, begging and finally arguing and was moved up the channels to the supervisor who said that he would look into the whole thing and try to resolve it positively and that he would give me a call back in an hour. There was no further response. Two hours later I called up again and went through the same song and dance and I was promised action and a call back within an hour.  Two hours later there was still no response and it was then too late for the flight and I missed a very important meeting, had to do a fair amount of damage control and the echoes of the mess are still around. I was very upset and I wanted to send out irate, damaging rants about MakeMyTrip right after the fiasco but I cooled off and felt that one error should not be held against almost two years of satisfactory service and just left off. Today, I just checked my account for the promised refund and found that it had still not made it. I called up customer care again and found out that due to some other technical glitch my refund had not been processed at all and that they were willing to cancel my booking and that my refund would be processed by MakeMyTrip within another 5 working days  and that there would be no 'penalty on the cancellation' at which point I hit the roof. I was then talking to my colleagues about this and came to know that in the past couple of months, out of the 25 tickets we'd booked on MakeMyTrip, 6 times MakeMyTrip took our money but did not book the ticket. They then took an average of more than 10 days to process the refund. And then the bank took another week or so. I just did a rough estimate and I wanted to post it here. From our experience we had a failure rate of around 24% or almost 1/4th. Assuming that MakeMyTrip has an average of 200 bookings per day, then this so-called glitch occurs 50 times a day with an average of let's say Rs. 10, 000 per booking. That is Rs. 5, 00, 000 in MakeMyTrip's account each day for free. Keeping the money for 10 days means that they have an extra Rs.50, 00, 000 in their account. The interest that they earn on this money itself would be fairly significant at around Rs.40, 000 per month not to mention having a nice hefty cash balance to show off. Till I played around with the figures I though it was just plain incompetence and bad design with a measure of utter disregard for the customer thrown in but now I am beginning to wonder if the high rates of failure is planned and this is a part of their business strategy.  In which case, MakeMyTrip would be deliberately profiting from customers' monies under the guise of technical glitches. I would like the reaction of other customers on this. What has been your ratio of successful to unsuccessful bookings and how long has MakeMyTrip taken to process your refund?",1
2676,"Booked a bus ticket through MMT and bus broke down in between. When I asked for refund MMT is asking me to collect the refund directly from tour operator who is goon.

With reference to your mail, we would like to inform you that we have received the revert from our concern team that the bus was not break down on that day and all passenger traveled in sleeper bus only so operator denied for refund in this case.

2677,MMT seems to be struggling with profits and are trying to LOOT customers in several ways. I recently had to cancel airline ticket and these guys took 15 days to refund and almost consumed 75% as cancellation charges. Ticket price : 2000 Airline cancellation fee: (-)1000 MMT Convenience fee: (-) 300 MMT Service fee : (-) 250 refund :  450 Had I booked directly with indigo I would have got this deal Ticket price : 2000 Indigo cancellation fee: (-)1000 Indigo Convenience fee: (-) 100 Indigo Service fee : (-) 0 refund : 900 So remember you are getting double refund booking directly with the airline website and you dont have to go thru the hassle of calling MMT 20 times to process the refund. However MMT is a good source to check the prices with various airlines first. Beware that also is not always good. sometimes MMT drops low fares from airlines like Air India express maybe because the commission is less for them ..,1

I am writing this review in airport and still I got the message that your flight is scheduled at right time.... however flight has already departed in the morning. Now you yourself decide.,1
2710,"So far it was my first & worst experience in my life when I had booked ticket from baroda to indore throgh bus journeyon make my trip.com  & I had cancelled my tickets before 48 hours of my journey time. They had given me only 50% of my ticket money. They are litrellay cheating people & not responding even if we call there customer executives,  giving some nonsense excusives. Instead of  the fact that I had booked the tickets directly through the traveller,  they give me 100% cash back on my cancellation before 48 hours. So never book the tickets from make my trip.com.",1
2711,"Yesterday night I spend four hours trying to book a domestic flight with credit card. The payment went through once yet the booking failed so the message showed up to book again. so I did again, second time also they received the payment but the booking was not done. The refund takes two days. they have the money. The seats are still available at the same price. When asked to hold the seats for me so that I can purchase it at the same price when they release the money, they have no able to do that. Sales rep cannot give the phone to managers. Good facilities but poor customer service, We need treat customers in a better way if we want to compete with the rest of the world. That is it from now on I will try some other travel company.",1
2712,"I hvae tried to use make my trip 5 times so far for booking domestic air tickets from Bangalore to Jaipur. 4 out of 5 times, this is what I faced: They show some tempting tickets prices, also proceed all the way till the payment is done, and then they display message ""Sorry! Your booking has failed!"". Easy way to block you money. In the refund process, they deducted some 2000 rs per person and when I asked them the reason for it, they said it was again a mistake from their side. If you don't notice they make hefy profit without doing anything. Big time cheaters in business, I would say........Just stay away from MMT.",1
2713,"I never thought of writing anything like this but after going through the horrific experience of my trip planned by MMT I thought of sharing it with people who read reviews so that they don't go through the same. I planned a trip to Vaishno Devi and Kashmir with my family and asked MMT to plan the same and send me the quotes. They assured me that they are giving me the 3 or 4 star rating hotels, and travel for sight seeing and other movement by an AC Indica car in the quotes provided. Thinking MMT as a genuine and good trip planner I gave them my consent for the booking. I paid the whole amount as per the schedule for hotel and travel booking but later to my surprise after reaching the hotel the booking was not done by MMT. After coming down from Vaishno Devi we had a booking in Luxury hotel to take rest for the whole day but MMT has not sent them the booking voucher, when we contacted the concerned person (Ekta Vaidya) and MMT Helpdesk they kept us waiting for 4 hours to finally accommodate in a very cheap hotel. We were so tired that we could not argue with them in hope that rest of our trip would be fine but unfortunately it was not, there were still lot surprises waiting for us. In the evening I get a call that our Hotel booking in Pahelgam is also not confirmed and they are looking for an alternate property. In the morning we had to travel to Pahelgam from Katra which is almost 8 Hrs journey, we had a booking for an AC indica but a non AC very old xylo came to take us to pahelgam, when we asked driver to turn on the AC he said booking is for non ac car, we again called MMT booking agent and got the response that what can she do if travel agency has sent the wrong car and after 1 hour of argument we had to travel in the same khattara car to pahelgam. In the meantime MMT agents made some deal with the tour agent of car and provided accomodation in a very cheap resort owned by the travel agent himself, we already had our trip spoiled. My wife fell sick in those 2 days of our saty at pahelgam. On 3rd day at pahelgam we got another Indica Car and again the same argument for AC and non AC started with driver, after 1 hr of argument and many calls driver started the AC and took us to Srinagar where we had a booking in House boat which was so dirty and so smelly that we spent most of our time in the drawing room of that HB in place of bedroom even though we were so tired. By now I have lost all my patience and my wife has also fell very sick. Next day we had the booking in a Hotel which they claimed to be a 4 start hotel but trust me it was not even worth 1 star, I found all the people there in the hotel had booked it through MMT, I bet it must be owned by MMT, anyway we finally got our room at 1 PM and guess what they even haven't changed the bedsheet and covers. We asked them to change it and again they put the used bedsheet and covers. We didn't go anywhere in next 2 days and just waited in hotel room for the trauma to get over and get back to our home asap, finally our memories unlimited trip came to an end. I genuinely request every reader of this review not to do any booking with Makemytrip or any travel agency, just read the reviews of the hotel and travel agency by yourself and do the booking by calling the hotels directly or from hotel website. Hope my experience save some people from these crooks and thieves. Thanks Nikhil Kumar",1
2714,"I took Premium, 6 night, 7 day package of MMt from 29th May.They booked  air ticket with 2 pnr numbers of same airline, for 2 sectors, fully knowing that I am 67 years old.my wife 63 years old.We boarde a flight going to Srinagar via delhi.We had to get down at Delhi, carryour luggage, recheckin after loitering in delhi airport for 5 hours.Same on return.In house boat we had no hot water, no water in flush.The care tacker made only one bad subzi for dinner.Except Raa Villa all other hotels were not even 3 star ina premium package!. They facilitate loot by local touts for no reason at Gondola, whereas one can go directly. Knowing fully well 2nd stage is not working , they make you spend on snow gadgets. Overall, its pathetic.",1
2715,Hotel and Flight booking section of make my trip is your way to creating a big hole in your pocket if you end up changing any dates. By mistake I booked my return flight for the wrong date and my hotel booking was till the next day. There is no alert system on their website as obvious they want to cash on a mistake. The money suckers don't allow you to change the date or flight booking - you have to cancel the whole package. Worse case they should be rebooking at a cheaper price catch on your browser cookies and moment you go to book they double the fare. The call center guys don't tell you the cancellation charges properly and give you mumbo and jumbo of sector wise cancellation and then charge you per ticket cancellation of Rs.2000. Their call center exec are hard to deal with and on committing mistakes don't admit the mistake. I ended up paying Rs 8000 cancellation for 2 passengars for Del-Hyd-Del. Beware never trust make my trip - its the worst service provider ever. It was my mothers doctors appointment which is on stake because of these buggers. Boycott makemytrip!,1
2716,No customer support. They claim they give cheapest hotel rates and flight rates. This time when I booked a hotel from them and cancelled it  within 4 hrs of booking cos I got better rate by the hotel directly on its website. Even though they(makemytrip) say no charge for the cancellation before 2pm but my booking was done after 2 pm so that policy has no meaning. Still they charged me one night stay even when hotel has no such policy. Then I asked them to keep the booking on that they said since its already being cancelled so money has to deducted from the cancelled booking and I have to make a fresh booking. Their manager never comes online for resolving any disputes. This is called lootna without any guilt and fear of law.,1
2717,"We just had a terrible experience with the travel agency, MakeMyTrip on June 27, 2013.  We had booked our E-tickets on April 20th, 2013 for our flight on June 27, 2013 from SFO-London, a break in London for few days to see London and Paris, and onward journey to Delhi; return flight from Bangalore to SFO on July 26th. When we(family of four) arrived to check in at 5:30pm at SFO airport, on June 27th, 2013, the airline representative told us that this ticket was cancelled since the airline was not paid in time by the booking agency MakeMyTrip, (even though our credit card was charged USD 9, 200 on April 20th, 2013 and we were issued a confirmed E-ticket for this flight). We were unable to board the UA-930 flight to London and had to come back home. We had booked on British Airways BA0322 connecting flight to Paris, made hotel reservations in Paris, London, Delhi and Agra. All this was ruined. We contacted the customer care immediately from the airport and were continuously on phone from 6:00pm PST, June 27th for nearly four hours and early morning June 28th. We repeatedly asked them to step up this issue and to let us talk to a manager to resolve this issue quickly. They were not at all helpful and refused to escalate the issue. At one point, they told us to “step outside and have a cup of tea and they will call us back after three hours”….this response while we were frantically trying to resolve the issue and board the flight before it departed SFO airport! Adding insult to injury, they asked us to PAY for another flight departing on June 29th, 2013 from SFO while they process the refund(which may take 2-3 weeks)! Instead of “making my trip” this travel agency essentially “broke” our trip!",1
2718,"Well, after becoming a victim of makemytrip.com, I am harassed, frustrated and looted and thought of writing a review for the welfare of others but I am shocked to see that there are already hundreds of such reviews and still these shameless people are running their company by cheating and looting others. They don't have any fear of law and order. I feel like we all victim should come together and should take them in court. Anyhow, I will just copy paste the letter written by me to their customer support fro everyone to see. Dear Mr. Rahul Kaura, On 9th February, 2013, I had done two return Ticket bookings from Dubai to Mumbai using makemytrip.com and with my HDFC Credit Card. The booking ID for both the booking is given below : 1) Booking ID - NN230165558594 – Return Ticket for Mr. Sapan Sheshnaryan Singh from Dubai to Mumbai with departure date as 31st July, 2013 and return date as 28th August, 2013. The Airline for both the sector was Indigo Airline. 2) Booking ID – NN230165558552 – Return Ticket for my wife and Son from Dubai to Mumbai with departure date as 4th July, 2013 and return date as 28th August, 2013. The Airline for both the sector was Indigo Airline. The flight No. for both the booking and for both the sector (for departure and return) was same. Due to some unavoidable circumstances I had to postpone my journey and our return to Dubai was cancelled so on 16th June, 2013 I called makemytrip UAE customer care No. 800- 01- 46342 where I asked the customer representative whether the departure date for both the booking can be postponed and return journey can be cancelled. For that I was told by your customer care representative that partial cancellation is not allowed and I will have to cancel the booking for both the sectors and will have to do a new booking. So before confirming cancellation I asked the customer representative to let me know the refund amount for both the cancellations. For that I was given below information: 1) Booking ID - NN230165558594 – The total amount paid by me using my HDFC ATM Card was Rs.14784 and after deducting cancellation charges of Rs. 4200, I was to be refunded Rs.10, 584. 2) Booking ID – NN230165558552 - The total amount paid by me using my HDFC Credit Card was Rs. 32, 364 and after deducting the cancellation charges of Rs. 4200 per passenger (total deduction of Rs. 8400 for my wife and son) I was to be refunded Rs. 23, 964. After getting the refund information, I asked the customer care to go ahead with the cancellation. After canceling the ticket on 16th June, 2013 afternoon, I was provided Cancellation reference number as given below : 1) For Cancellation of Booking ID - NN230165558594 – The reference number was IN1306R6S88397. 2) For Cancellation of Booking ID - NN230165558552 – The reference number was IN1306R6S88438. After cancellation confirmation of both the bookings, I logged in to my makemytrip account and found that for the booking ID NN230165558594 – the ticket status was updated as cancelled while for booking ID NN230165558552 – the ticket status for departure was updated as confirmed while for arrival it was showing cancelled status. Fearing any mistake by the customer care representative, I called the UAE Customer care again and informed them about the ticket status in my makemytrip.com account. For that I was again confirmed by the customer care representative that tickets for both the bookings and for both the sectors has been cancelled and I will be receiving a cancellation and refund confirmation mail very soon. Later within an hour I received an e-mail from makemytrip.com that booking corresponding to booking ID NN230165558594 has been done and after deducting Rs. 4200 from the paid amount, I will be refunded Rs. 10, 584. A refund status link was also provided to check the refund status. On clicking it, I found the same information. The PDF file sent by makemy trip is being attached. On 17th June, 2013, I received the second e-mail from makemytrip.com where in cancellation confirmation for the booking corresponding to booking ID NN230165558552 was done. The mail also contained the deduction information for the cancellation and was showing deduction of Rs. 8400 ( Rs. 4200 for my wife and Rs 4200 for my son), while refunded amount was Rs. 23, 964. Here also refund link was provided and on clicking it I found the same information. The PDF File sent by makemytrip.com is being attached for your information. On 19th June, 2013, I checked my credit card statement online and found that there were two deposits from make my trip of Rs. 7456 and Rs. 11010. Confused with the deposited amount, I called the makemytrip.com UAE customer care number and a lady customer care representative informed me that for the Booking ID NN230165558552, Rs. 7456 has been credited while Rs. 11010 was refunded for the cancellation of Booking ID NN230165558594. Confused with the credited amount of Rs. 7456 for the booking ID NN230165558552 for which I had paid Rs.32364 and refund amount confirmed to me was Rs. 23, 964, I asked the customer representative to detail me about the credited amount . On hearing this she told that she is from US Customer section and the call will need to be transferred to Domestic section and asked me to wait. After waiting for around 5-8 minutes, another guy took the call and after obtaining my booking ID and hearing my issue told me that the call need to be transferred to International Section and I will have to wait and I waited for 8 minutes and before anyone can take a call, the call was dropped. So after trying to get customer care representative from International section for more then 45 minutes, I decided to send an e-mail to customer care. I had sent the said e-mail on 20.06.13(Thursday)  at 05.48 P.M. Later, on Saturday morning after seeing no reply from the makemytrip customer care, I called the customer care number again. And after experiencing the same transfer, wait and disconnect cycle, the third time call was received by the international section customer representative. On informing him about the issue he asked me to wait till he checks the problem. Later after sometime he took the call and told me that the cancellation for the booking ID NN230165558552 was done for only departure and return has not been cancelled. I was shocked to hear this since I was informed that cancellation of one sector is not possible. Anyway, I told him that total amount paid by me was Rs. 32364 and refund amount confirmed to me was Rs. 23, 964 so even if one sector has been cancelled than why only Rs. 7456 has been credited. On listening this he said that there has been manual mistake done by the makemytrip.com and he is sorry for that. He confirmed me that the total mistake was of makemytrip.com and the balance amount for the refund amount of Rs 23964 will be deposited to my account. He again asked me to wait and after sometime the call was disconnected. In the afternoon I was shocked to receive your below e-mail saying that the refund amount is Rs. 7456 and the same has been processed. After which I called UAE customer care again and your representative confirmed me that the mistake was of makemytrip.com and I would be getting the balance amount deposited within three working days. For our conversation, she has given the reference number as 130622030613. This is for your information and needful. Regards, Sapan Singh",1

Refund is promised in 7-14 days. Initially they said on base fair after they said discount cannot be more than 1000 rupees. then how can the second ticket free?? Now I waited one month every time I call the customer support they said refund will be made in 3-4 days; Now I got the mail saying refund is not possible because the booking day and travel day is not having one week gap.

2722,"Was looking for help to book a flight from NYC to Bangalore and was given an outrageous fare by the agent. Below are the details. The emirates website had a fare cost of $2411 and was given a fare of $5822(more than twice) by your agent and the worst part, he asked me to check the website too(did he think we are dumb customers that do not know about the internet!!!) See the freak agent trying to give me a $10 discount(to buy peanuts ?)  on Air India and the airfare quoted on that flight was also outrageous(there were three other colleagues of mine that had similar experience-quoted outrageous airfare. A CEO friend of mine was quoted a business airfare cost for economy travel and was told that all business class seats were full. he paid and traveled and then realized his folly!)

2723,"Booked a package tour to Manali, and little did we know we would be harassed to the core for our packed tour. The Volvo till Manali was actually an ordinary bus not worth even sitting. Had to have a Fargument with there nerd agents over this but to no use, we preferred fortifying the money and take another bus spending our own money. Hotel as told by MMT being a 4* was actually a 2* worth hotel, the local taxi vendor in Manali no better bunch of thugs arguing on the package saying stupid things and asking for reasons for earning extra buck. Return bus journey even worse, the online seats given changed a their own discretion. What a shame. India and these scompanies like MMT make life horrific. Wish they are doomed sooner than latter. No abuses are enough for these rascals.",1

Now I try calling their customer service and they say they are facing high call schedules, After staying on line for 1 hr really got pissed of. I have even tried contacting the local Make My Trip office and they say sorry mam as you have booked the package online we cannot help you, you can avail our services only by dialing the customer service number. I have even lodged a complaint on their website 3 days ago and no one is least bothered to reply. Really pissed off with Make My Trip.",1
2725,"Booking ID: NU7903751240124 I received a message stating - ""Crazy bus Sale on Makemytrip! Get 50% cashback on bus bookings made on our mobile app between 4-5pm today(10th of May). Use DEAL CODe FLAT50 while booking"" I did the same and booked the bus ticket for two in the duration mentioned and also used the code ""FLAT50"". But after calling to the customer care so many times, they told I would receive the cash back within 14 days of dep date. I sent an email also for which I got a complaint ID: 130605-049407 , but unfortunately there was no response since the date I sent an email. After so many days when the time was over, as 14 days period was over on 14th june, I called the customer care & got the info at the very end that I didn't use the coupon mentioned above. Bullshit!! I did everything as mentioned on the message received and now just to deny the offer, they said coupon not mentioned. That's not my fault if there is a technical error at Makemytrip's end. Why the hell would I suffer. I paid Rs.620, and should get my Rs.310 as a cash back. I would suggest all the customers, never to believe on the offers given by makemytrip. One, thing more, that I mentioned on call on customer care with one of the executive, that the bus booking that was done gave me a lot of trouble. The bus conductor sold the ticket that I bought so many days ago. When we reached there 15mins before time, he said it has been sold already. which means there is no such co-ordination of Makemytrip with the Neeta Travels. We were given the front seats on the bus, after a long discussion. That too pathetic, I chose my own seat from makemytrip & got a pathetic n weird seat at front. Bad BOOKING SITE...!! Worst Experience..! All other booking sites are better, that they go with the offer they give.",1
2726,"I had booked a Thailand (BKK+Pataya) tour with MMT starting 1st Jan'13 for 8 nights, 9 days.  Fortunately, I did not go in for their all inclusive package, but selected hotels of my choice and flight of my choice.  However, I also booked some tour attractions through them where I faced the following problems: 1)Transfer from BKK to Pattaya and back is in a 10 seater vehicle where they would try to stuff more than the number of people allowed.  The drivers are absolutely foul mouthed and unfriendly as if they are doing some kind of favor to you.  So, when you book transfers, pls. insist on individual cars etc. so as to not face this kind of problem. 2)  Another problem I faced was on the tour to Dream world.  time to pick up was 7am however, we finally left bkk city only at 10 after collecting tourists from various hotels.  No time management, complete mis- management. 3) Finally the airport drop was almost a fatality, as the driver of the pickup fan waited at the wrong hotel for almost an hour delaying our departure by more than an hour from the hotel.  And with bkk traffic you can never be sure to reach on time. MMT should certainly look at these aspects of its Thailand tour partners and improve, else very soon they are bound to see a reduction in their bookings.",2
2727,Very Poor service. I have worst Experience in my life while travelling. I have traveled from Delhi to A'bad and they have taken more than 24 Hrs. Bus Condition was also Horrible.,1
2728,"I had some coupon code which I was unable to use as it was related to some mobile application download etc. I called up the customer toll free no, where there were unable to help and provided the number of their office in Mumbai (Andheri-East) as I was calling from Mumbai city. Now here a person named KUNAL, picked up my call, and after hearing to the query, responded to call up the toll free no, I told him clearly that they have given me the office no, to which he rudely responded as to we cant help u in this as its an online booking query. I understand that probably he may not be able to help me but the way he spoke was extremely rude, saying we are here to serve bla bla clients and not to sort out queries. I was annoyed and asked him for his designation to which he said"" Y do u need it"" . I mean you are speaking to a lady at least have some respect. I can understand there are times wen you cant help a customer but that doesn't mean you can be so impolite. Ridiculous experience. I was suppose to book an international ticket for some 10 clients traveling together but have considered a different agency for the same. Thanks to the bad experience on the phone.",1
2729,"Makemytrip should consider renaming itself as suggested in the title. It definitely has taken me on a ride even before I traveled on my trip. They had this promotional offer running for the last couple of months which promised Buy one ticket and get one free on domestic flights(the base fare upto maximum of Rs 1000). I had to enter the first trip's booking ID in the second trip's deal section. I was informed by Makemytrip that my deal offer could not be reimbursed as I had entered the booking ID wrongly. And what was wrong about the ID?! It had certain junk characters which one would not find in a normal keypad (NF22012266Â€‹457) . Even after escalating the issue to multiple levels and they acknowledging the fact that both my trips have been booked in their website, they refuse to avail this offer for me. It is not about a couple of thousands I would end up saving, but it is the feeling of being cheated by such a reputed co. Why flood our inboxes with promotions and offers if they dont want flyers to avail of it? It is appalling and disappointing, the reason given for the issue and the way it has been handled thereafter.",1
2730,"Being in USA, unfortunately I booked an airfare from USA to India. First, the travel agent quoted a price twice that was available on the airline website.I reminded the travel agent that the airline website had a lower rate than her quote. She even did not know the airline website(what a brat!). After hrs negotiation, got a quote and was asked to pay the money immediately(the crap of this being the last ticket with that airfare rate ...). I was on the phone with my bank for about 15 minutes to confirm the routing and there were already 5 messages from this travel agent asking me to pay the amount(harass) or I would loose the quoted rate. So the stupid me paid the amount and was told that the e-ticket will be sent to my email in half an hour. Two hrs go by and no e-ticket or email. Being late in the night, I go to bed. Next morning , no sign of any email or e-ticket. Called the travel agent and no response. After 5 email reminders, finally get a e-ticket showing the higher cost. Finally had to cancel the ticket due to fault of the airline and that is another long and nasty experience. Still waiting for a refund. Get automated messages asking to wait for 24 hrs, then 48 hrs, then 72 hrs and then NO REPSONSE. Travel agent companies (like makemytrip) in India have non-existent customer service. The company should be named ""makemypit"" rather than ""makemytrip"" . Are there any audit companies in India that audit (ISO etc) such ruthless travel agencies and submit reports to their managements. Wow, just got a brilliant idea for startup.",1

Then only they accepted their mistake and promised to refund the payment in 72 hours(3 days). But it is more than 10days, yet I haven't received my payment back. Such an irresponsible service, I even forwarded a complaint email to service@MakeMyTrip.com and contacted too many times via Twitter. But everything was resulted in failure. I highly recommended never never use MMT for booking your tickets/hotels for emergency:(",1
2735,"I booked a premium package to North East. Just narrating the experience in the bullets: Tickets were issued after a lot of reminders just a day before actual departure. The flights were changed from the promised ones. Even after 7 days of continuous complaints no-one including the management is looking into that. The vehicles provided at most of the locations were of worst type. Huge wait at places and no local support. The tour co-ordinator never bothered. Neither complaints to the support center recorded. The best part is that customer support center refused to lodge the complaint. Hotels and food was decent. Overall despite all the tall claims, the company tried to cut corners to make more and more money. Lesson learnt: Never ever use MMT even for Air ticket booking.",1
2736,"Make-my-trip to Disaster– that is what my Makemytrip holiday turned out to be. They made commitments on hotels and took additional money for A category hotel, agreed on a route plan – Bagdogra-Gangtok-Kalimpong- Bagdogra. On the day of departure they sent the hotel vouchers – B grade hotels and interchanged destination sequence. When I protested, they blamed it on their agent. I ended up in hotels infested by  cockroaches, spiders, and mosquitoes, and not having even a ceiling fan for ventilation in the heat of May. On the last day I had to rise at an unearthly hour  and race through the mountain roads/ landslides from Gangtok to Bagdogra to catch a flight.   So much for a company with IIMA guys at the helm of affairs. Even the taxi drivers at Kalimpong and Gangtok talk derisively about Makemytrip.",2
2737,"Actually I don't even want to give single star.  The customer agents  lack knowledge.  I was handled by 4 persons, none of them had deep knowledge of what they are doing? Because of their mistake, my first booking was not confirmed as result I paid INR10K additional to confirm tkts on same dates. I wanted to book through make my trip to get front seat for disabled parents, they weren't helpful and charge more than British Airways flight. I would never suggest to use this  service, they are useless",1
2738,"I had multiple issues. First, they double booked me and charged me twice. Second the ""confirmed"" booking was not true and on the day of the trip we had no tickets. I implore you, save your money and heartache!!",1
2739,"The worst website you would ever come across.The icing on the cake is their customer care, they keep the calls on hold as if its all for free and you are the most idol person waiting just for them to talk to you. If they cant answer your queries they would simply disconnect your call. I have not received my refund for the flight tickets I cancelled 15 days back. For this they just procrastinate and are doing simply nothing. A lady named SPARDHA put my call on hold for multiple times and ultimately disconnected when she could not answer the query. Not dealing again!",1
2740,"MakeMyTrip confirmed my hotel booking 22 days before the actual check-in date, only to receive a shock on the actual check-in date where the hotel staff said there was no booking in my name. It was a planned vacation on the occasion of my marriage anniversary and MakeMyTripspoiled it, Ihad to return back home on the very same day. I would say stay away from MakeMyTrip, they are liars.",1
2741,"Booked shimla-kullu honeymoon package for my cousin. (Booking id - 130602-022464)The call-center technician booked the package on call and paid it by my credit card. She never mentioned that there will be extra taxes every where they take us. The couple had to pay Rs.500 in every hotel they checked-in, in terms of taxes and other nonsense. When I tried to complain, the technician did not know, if taxes are to paid or not. She was referring to some clause in the voucher ""• Please collect all extras directly from the guests at the time of check-out."" And said you have to pay extra tax, what ever they ask. When I called back, another technician from MakeMyTrip suggested the hotel(De Park) they booked is not in recommended list of MakeMyTrip. So, I understood that the trip consultants are aware of sub-standard hotels and yet they book it, as we are not aware of them. They talk all sweet nonsense when we are booking it, but not the necessary things like extra taxes etc. These call-center technicians either are not knowledgeable or faking to us regarding the hotel standards.",1
2742,"Pattaya, a popular beach resort of Thailand, reminded me, a distant land-locked north-westerner, of my yesteryear trips to our very own Goa though the  beaches here are cleaner with clear sands and water, and it boasts a more vibrant and busy (read sleazy) nightlife. My hotel in Pattaya was barely 300 meters from the bay with the balcony of the room on the 3rd floor looking out towards the sea. Bulk of the tourists comprised the fair and slim men and women from other South East Asian countries and the rest from Europe, with, of course, a thin smattering of my own countrymen.  The young ladies manning the reception counter at the hotel wore typical Thai smiles wishing graceful ‘SAWASDEE KHAs’ ( a namaste kind of salutation) but lacked the Indian warmth, poor articulation in English worsened by the difficult Thai accent only compounding the misery. A stroll on the famous (infamous for the saintly and the sinless) Walking Street was an interesting and a never-before and never-again experience. This street - a busy shopping hub in the day - looks incredibly transformed in its night avatar. The traffic ceases giving way to western music, orchestra and boisterous bustle and fun. The  ‘go-go’ bars come alive with the  mini-skirted girls with heavy make-ups  standing boldly in front holding invitational placards and the furtive boys materialising from nowhere before you with lurid pics, luring you to enjoy a ‘sex show’. “Hey, sex show?” you would hear. “Just 300 Bahts, bery gud.” I stumbled into a couple of these sleek guys but the trite sleaziness of it all was  a little too much for my (Indian) senses and sensibilities and I beat a hasty retreat with Ghalib’s lines dinning in my ears: “… Dil mein taaqat jigar mein haal kahaan?/ Hamse chhootaa qimaar-khaana-e-ishq/Vahaan jo jaayen girah mein maal kahaan?” (Heart is exhausted and body sapped/ Those dens of love now for me no more/ Where have I the requisites for entry to that door?)  Further on, there was a gay bar housed by young boys in skimpy underwear signalling you in;  the  Thai special  sports bars with Thai kick-proboxinggear1 bouts going on; and some others with high-pitched live bands for their customers sitting in the open, enjoying the music, the drink and the spectacle unfolding in the street. The street food in Pattaya was a gastronomic delight. A big bowlful of steamy Tom Yum Goong (spicy shrimp soup) loaded with bountiful veggies and herbs in a roadside eatery provided a bellyful of a good Thai meal without burning a hole in the pocket. Lady?...Er… Ladyboy The ‘ladyboys’ (transsexuals and transgenders) are another unique feature of Thai life and they are known to be as stunningly captivating as the svelte Thai ladies, and difficult to tell apart as well. Sadly, getting woefully late on each occasion, I missed out on both, the Alcazar and the Tiffany’s - the two very popular culutural/cabaret shows - performed by the ladyboys. ( But wasn’t the  tall, long-, raven- and straight-haired stunner of a Thai beauty who showed me and fellow tourists around a very professionally-run gem factory in Bangkok our lady guide took us to, a ladyboy ?…Her deep husky voice I thought betrayed unmistakable traces of masculinity.) Tuk tuks - colourful versions of our own desi auto rickshaws - are a very convenient, affordable and preferred mode of transportation both for the native and the alien. And don’t be surprised or shocked (I certainly was) if you find among the commuters a good 70-year-old ‘firang’ sitting just across you with his gnarled but amorous hand stroking the smooth, bare thigh of his 20-year old Thai girlfriend, with absolute nonchalance and without the slightest blush. Wats and Bahts Joined by a young couple from Bangalore with a toddler, Nikki, our articulate, cheerful and sprightly guide in Bangkok takes us round the two famous Budha temples called Wats. Wat Pho Tho is the temple of the Reclining Budha- a splendid work of art in gold leaf. Its sheer size (46 metres long) and grace and grandeur take your breath away. It attracts hordes of visitors - both the devout Thais and the admiring tourists – who are left marvelling at it as they go about circumambulating this unique image. The second one that we saw was Wat Mahathat, close by. A centre for the study of Budhism and meditation, it has humbler proportions but the serenity and tranquillity that exudes out of this Budha image in a sitting posture against the soul-soothing background music is a surreal kind of experience. These Wats comprise a part of the Grand Palace which is a complex of buildings - and was the old royal residence of the kings of Siam/ Thailand once - located on the west side of Chao Phraya river. On our way back drive after the city tour, Nikki sitting in the front tells us about the changing Thai society, improving gender equality and status of women, and how tourism (commercial sex tourism - a legacy of the Vietnam war -  contributing significantly) came second after exports as a driver of Thai economy.  “How about the crime rate against women in Thailand, Nikki?” I find myself asking her as our vehicle glides (the flow of traffic in Thailand is smooth, disciplined and noiseless- such a welcome change for Indian senses) past the Democracy Monument, constructed to commemorate the ‘1932 revolution’ and the establishment of ‘constitutional monarchy’. “Are women safe here walking the streets alone in the night?” chips in my Bangalorean co-tourist. “It is as safe or un-safe both for men and women as any other place anywhere. Only, you have to be alert, ” she says rather diplomatchandru021y.  Of course, crime, sex and drug trafficking get to be a part of any modernising society, Thailand being no exception. But with such openness and free-spirited abandon that characterises Thai life, things like the Delhi gang rape and the Khap diktats would perhaps be rarer than common, to my mind. While Wats delighted, the bahts disappointed. Both in Pattaya and Bangkok, I had difficulty getting my humble Indian rupee exchanged for the Thai bahts both in the hotels where I stayed as well as at the various exchange counters. When I mentioned this to Nikki, to my relief, she promptly obliged me by exchanging the rupees for bahts at a reasonably good rate. A Touch sore One sore point in this touch-and-go package tour that rankled all through was the brashness and show of temper by a lady representative of the travel agency to my rather mild remonstrance about the delay at the Suvarnabhumi airport in Bangkok. Must-do A Thai massage. It lasts a fleeting one hour, costs you at least 300 bahts and with an all-smiles, ‘Sawasdee kha’-wishing Thai lady (or a boy/lady boy, if you like) all over you with her hands, feet, knees - kneading, pressing, squeezing, twisting your weary and staid limbs and muscles – you feel light and refreshed; and the sensuous feel of the soft Thai-an thighs that pressed against you lingers on… Subhash Sharma (subsharma51@gmail.com)",4
2743,"I booked a Hotel in Goa from MMT and they charged me 867 rs as Taxes and Service Fees when I checked with Hotel directly, hotel manager told me that this is collected by MMT for their services.

2746,"We had booked 4 nights stay at Oberoi Cecil, Shimla. As per the discussion with MakeMyTrip the room to be booked was deluxe with breakfast and total amount was Rs. 39923 all taxes inclusive. The voucher received after making the payment was room only with additional tax and breakfast cost. We have already raised a complaint and had been following up with them since past 4 days and we are about to check out but they are so much careless that they don't even bother to resolve the problem. Instead they have asked us to pay the amount and said will refund if the issue is resolved. How can you trust such a company. Every time call is routed to some or the other call center executive and they all give same answer that the issue will be resolved in 72 hours. Worst company to deal with. This company is such a fraud that they did not even refund the amount of flight cancellation. We had to write several emails to them and they refunded amount of Rs. 776 after 1-2 months. Similar experience happened with my brother when he had been to Goa. Make MyTrip had committed that they will refund money but it's almost a year and they are not yet refunding. They have attitude of not returning money just swallow it. Unethical, unprofessional and hardcore cheaters running the company.",1
2747,"We booked 7 nights Jammu & Kashmir package through Mmt during May 2013.  Till 2 days before, MMT did not confirm the flight details. At Jammu, we were promised that somebody will meet us with the car to take us to Katra. MMT organised for a indica car for four adults, and if we wanted a bigger vehicle, we were asked to wait for 3 hours as 2 more families were arriving Jammu by 2 o clock flight and all of us will be taken together.  However, upon much debate and discussion, a Innova was arranged. At  Katra, we were booked in   ATRIUM   Hotel. The hotel ambiance is good but service is poor. It was learnt that they just started booking for the group packages and they were inexperienced till then.  We were not informed about the timings for next day departure, what vehicle was coming etc. At every step, we had to FOLLOW UP CLOSELY with MMT and it seemed that in whole of our vacation, 50 % of the time we were holding our phone with MMT. At Phalgam, we were booked in WOODSTOCK HOTEL.  The hotel was good, the room was good and the service was excellent.  Only thing is they do not use spoons, tongs to serve salad, chapathis etc. people would just dig in their hands into the dish. At Gulmarg, we were given a horrible hotel Zageer International. The Package was to give 3 and 4 star hotels. This hotel was under construction. The entrance had bricks, dumpyard. The rooms had no curtain rods, glass pieces on the floor, cement smell, paint, tv hanging loose, no room heater working in one of the rooms, electric blanket not working, curtains on the floor, stinking mattresses piled on the floor outside the room, bathroom ceiling unfinished.  However, upon lots of phone time and frustrated voices, things were fixed and we were given two rooms to rest. Our friends room had to be shifted to ground floor since the heater, nor electric blanket were working. The hotel looked very scary for families. The staff at MMT are very discourteous and they put down the phone abruptly. Nobody takes a decision and evening they say reservaton department is closed. We wouldnt know about the hotel till we check in and then it is too late. The review about Zageer International is mentioned in that hotel review. Then we went to Srinagar. We were put up in Royal Batoo. This hotel is very nice, but again the food is hopeless. The food given for this package is very poor quality. Here atleast we had one representative of MMT always at the hotel. We were given Traveller van for three families together. The van driver was very good. Van was okay. Overall, we had to minutely follow up with MMT at every step and it causes lot of stress and frustration.  I think we are better off dealing with the hotels directly rather than through MMT.  Companies such as MMT should not be in the business of travel. No commitment, no professionalism, no trained staff, telephone lines unanswered. Inspite pf all this we thoroughly enjoyed the nature and scenic beauty of Jammu and Kashmir. It talks about how beautiful this creation of God is on this earth.",2
2748,"We booked Himachal hues group package through makemytrip.com on 29th April for 9th may... the response was very good by the office staff in HRBR layout, Bangalore.

The half day sightseeing was nice which followed it. The next day we left Delhi for Shimla. The bus was comfortable. We had lots of fun in the bus with our tour manager. We played Chinese whisper and introduced ourselves. Next day we visited kufri and had lots of fun. there was discounts for pony ride. The next day we left to Manali which is a heavenly place. Had lots of fun there. rooms in Shimla, Manali, Chandigarh and Delhi were really good. Food also was good. The package was worth the money we paid.

On the day of departure when I called just to confirm for safe side because the last three months have been so awful that I couldn't trust them for a penny they informed me that the flight has been canceled and when I started screwing them about their service they simply said to contact the airline.

2755,"If u are going on family vacation and want to have some pleasant time in trip then. Don't ever book from ""make my trip.com"".Believe me if u book you will ruin it for yourself and your family what could have been a nice trip. We had taken the trip package to Thailand from thru ""make my trip.com"". I have been on so many trips thru different companies, most of them were good but this trip with ""make my trip.com"" was so horrible.To begin with: I had not got my confirmation vouchers till the date of departure. Once we reached Thailand we were picked up at airport and dropped to pattaya first, the vendors of ""make my trip.com"" are so unbelievably horrible and unco-operative. the driver dropped us in front of hotel, kept our baggage out of the van and drove off with out even being courteous enough to help us take it in. We checked in at 9 AM to find out that no rooms are available till 2 PM, we had to spend time in lobby for 5 hrs.The tour guide was suppose to meet us at the hotel and take us to NOngNoch village, nobody came to meet us and nobody came to pick us up as per itinerary. At 6 we were pick up from hotel to go to Alcazar show then we came to know that they had cancelled the afternoon program and postponed to next day.The tickets given to us for alcazar show were of cheap seats.On finishing the show the tour drives was suppose to drop us at beach road but first we wanted to go to hotel first to drop off the key at the reception the shocking thing happened then. We entered the hotel immediately the tour driver drove off with out even informing us, what if we had left the bag in the cab.i tried calling him so many times to his not but he did not pick the call even once. When I called ""make my trip.com"" to inform about the happenings, those ppl started blaming other dept's in the office but gave us no solution at all. We on our own had to do everything. He shut his mouth after that, finally That bloody bugger who makes his lively hood cos of tourists like us needed to be taught a lesson. Seriously, Thailand heritage and culture is so warm and welcoming but these tour ppl proved it wrong like a theorem. They were downright rude and horrible. The driver of cab was horrible of all. Just to get acquainted I greeted him asked his name for that he got angry and showed his palm telling that he is not interested to talk to anyone. Then while ending the day tour the tour guide was dropping us off at madame Tussads museum. I asked him the route back from there to our hotel, he told us in his low scum class English which I did not understand, so I asked him again for that he got angry and spoke in loud voice and spoke something with driver in Thai language. I got irritated and told the guide that I will complain if his attitude towards us is so bad, for that he got of the cab and slammed the door and went without even greeting us bye. And last day we were dropped off us airport 5 hrs in advance.In our Van there was a physically challenged child. She went to sit in the co-drivers seat, for that the driver started shouting at that child.It was so in-humane of him. They are worst than wild animals in their behavior. We everybody in van got angry and scolded the driver properly. The whole trip thru ""make my trip.com"" was a disaster. They do cost cutting in all. What they show and tell and what they provide is completely different. We were suppose to be given a room with the balcony but were given a room where we cannot open the windows also in Pattaya. Once they get payment , ""make my trip.com"" does even bother to care and respond to their customers. worst after payment service I have seen in my life. Their vendors in Thailand are some low class thugs running tours and travels locally, their service level is so bad, even if monkeys were given a chance would provide better service than their local vendors. They shout at you as though they are doing us a charity act, given a chance they will get physical also. Never go with ""make my trip.com"", they take a lot of money and wont give half of its worth service.Please consider my honest opinion before finalizing on ""make my trip.com"" Sunil.",1

2758,"Booked a customized holiday package with departure on May 11, 2013 midnight, from MMT's Andheri East, Mumbai office. While writing this review on May 09, 2013 I have not received any confirmed flight bookings along with any other vouchers - hotel, sightseeing etc. Agents involved have being - Neeta Vardhanapu and Sidhdesh Malik. We are 3 people traveling and flight tickets have been changed thrice. One of the passengers is 4 years old and her ticket has been issued under a separate PNR with no adult in the same booking. I had to check with Lufthansa to get to know that my daughter will not be able to travel if there is no adult traveling under the same booking. I have mailed both Neeta and Sidhdesh and not received any response. On May 08 I spoke to your branch manager, Swapnil Parikh at around 5 p.m. and detailed my greviance and he assured that he will call back with details within 10 mins. Till such time, no response has been received from him. No hotel vouchers and other sightseeing vouchers have been received by me. I have been following up since the past over one month and only assurances have been given. As late as yesterday I received a mail from Neeta that I would receive all vouchers etc by May 08 evening, but again nothing has come. There are many other issueswhich can  be highlighted, but currently, I am deeply disturbed that after paying off almost the entire trip amount I have nothing in hand and I am traveling in the next 2 days. I am not even sure if the bookings will be authentic and MMT's vendors in Europe will honour the committments. I want an immediate solution to the issue at hand and would like that there is a complete handholding process. *Pathetic customer service and backend operations. Would recommend to others to pay a little more and book through renowned agencies. MMT is good only for comparing filght bookings. Now with their new web pages design, that is also difficult! PLEASE HELP!!!",1
2759,"I booked a bus from Delhi to Dehradun from Make my trip (MMT). The bus agency was Kalpana Bus Agency. They had this luxuries sleeper bus at affordable price. The bus departure time was 9:30 PM near Anand Vihar Station. I reached at 9:15 PM and was waiting for the bus. I asked people standing over there if they were waiting for the same bus. None of them was of the same bus. The time was 10 PM and I thought that I had missed the bus. I was constantly calling the number given on the ticket to Kalpana Travels but no one picked up. Then I found a friend of Dehradun and he also was waiting for the same bus. Pheww, I was not alone. We waited and then at 10:30 the bus came. I asked them that the time for the bus to leave Delhi was 9:30 PM so why had they come at 10:30. The conductor cum driver (KHAN) said that they decide when they want to come and when they leave. The tone in which that illiterate man spoke was very harsh and I realized that booking a private bus from Make my trip was a grave mistake. This was followed by more sick activities. The bus operator came and started filling more passengers. This activity took place till 12:00 AM. At 12:00 AM the bus started and I got some relief. However it didn't last long enough. About 2 hours after the bus had started its journey to Dehradun suddenly we met with an accident. It seemed it was a small one but no one could realize the impact much as the bus was a double decker sleeper bus. No one in the bus actually looked outside as the bus had curtains and black windows. I thought that the situation was under control but suddenly 2 guys from the back came with bleeding noses and scratches. They went to the driver and started shouting at him. I came forward to see what was happening and the view was horrible. The driver side had huge impact of the accident. There was no wind shield and the driver's gate had been convoluted inwards. The steering was not at its place and the driver was also bleeding. He said that he will take the bus to a restaurant near by which the company owned. They called ambulance at the restaurant and we reached there in another 10 minutes. The bus driver said he had fallen asleep and he struck a standing truck near the flyover. Mr. Khan till that moment was reluctant to say sorry to any passengers and he firmly believed that accidents like those are very common. He said the bus was almost going to dive from the flyover. It was really death defying. Also it was January and was very cold outside. We had to wait for 2 hours there when another bus came for us. I recently saw the consumer reviews for Kalpana travels on MMT and you will not believe that even after everyone giving them 1 star to the max this agency had 5 stars in total reviews. MMT is directly responsible for such hidden modified hideous reviews.  I will never book anything from MMT. If they had been a responsible company they could have removed Kalpana bus service from their website. But they did not. I will ask all of to go directly to Anand Vihar Bus station and take a Uttrakhand Bus transport cooperation bus. They are timely, well spoken and charge very reasonable. Moreover Uttrakhand bus will stop for mid meal at McDonalds while these private bus stops at really bad dhabas. The dhabas are of very poor quality and sell very substandard food at very high costs. Please make a informed choice.",1
2760,"I agree with a lot of reviews written in this forum and I wish we could all get together and file a collective consumer forum complaint and make them pay hefty compensations. Because unless they do it, they will not understand about how careful they need to be when providing services anything below what they promise and take the payment for. We had booked some hotel rooms in Mumbai for the guests arriving for my sister's marriage much before the requisite time through makemytrip.com. They took the entire payment at the time of booking. But to our horror and embarrassment we realized just two nights before that the hotel has disagreed that we had any booking and just outright rejected the makemytrip voucher. When we informed makemytrip, they didnt respond and instead just mailed one night before that only 30% of the rooms were confirmed. What did they expect us to do. Make the other guests sleep on road !! This created a huge embarrassment and loss of reputation for us. Please don't use their services. They are the worst website you can deal with. BEWARE !!! To add we had to make a last minute booking in another hotel at full rates. We had to literally make my sister's family run around the streets of Mumbai to get a suitable hotel. Finally we got one, but due to last minute booking we ended up paying more instead of the discount which we would have otherwise got if we pre-booked it. Make my trip till date has shamelessly not even refunded the amount due to us. Please join and file a CONSUMER SUIT against such corporate who just scam people's hard earned money and play around with their reputation.",1
2761,"I have had the same disastrous experience as the below customers. I bought a return ticket. The airline cancelled the return flight(2 months prior to the date) and as I need to connect with another international flight, I requested a refund with the comment following reply: ""Dear Mr. Bxxxxxxxd, Greetings from MakeMyTrip! With the reference to your below e-mail we would like to inform you that we got the final confirmation from the airline as there is no full refund will be given as they are giving us the option for schedule change."" As I got no more replies to my further  request of full refund(as I simply could not believe I was treated this badly), I then decided to try to change the date of the ticket and I got the following  reply requesting me to pay a change penalty: ""Dear Mr. Bxxxxxxxd, Greetings from MakeMyTrip! We would like to inform you that for date change you need to call us on our help line. You will be charge the date change penalty AED 100+ fare difference(subject to availability) Per passenger"" What to say? The customer service logic and lack of integrity in doing business is so unbelievable unacceptable that it is laughable. The company has really MadeMyTrip a very expensive one, so AVOID DOING ANY BOOKINGS ON THIS SITE.",1
2762,Booked with them with the offer of 5% cash back...it is almost a year and I have contacted them several times...we were 6 people and it was a substantial amount that they were supposed to give as cash back...will never every book through them again.,1
2763,"I booked a return flight for my wife+infant from makemytrip including the insurance. They didnt mention that I need to purchase separate travel insurance for returning and assumed that its covered for both the way. But when I received the policy document, they said its covered for maximum one month or the date of return(which ever is coming earlier). I didnt find this type of important details at the time of booking the flight. When I raised my concern, they clearly said you have to talk the insurance company directly. If I'm not wrong we have to pay some fixed charges to makemytrip for the services. If it is correct, then why should I talk with them, its become makemytrip responsibility to sort out the issue and come out with conclusion. Otherwise I can directly take the insurance and book the flights. I used makemytrip, considering that they will take care of all my travelling problems. But I was wrong. My suggestion, please opt the makemytrip services CAREFULLY. Insurance is not the concern, but highly  un-satisfied with the responsibilities. Vipin",2

2765,"I have booked a Domestic Holiday Package through MakeMyTrip to GOA through Mohd Arif Khan(Sr. Holiday Expert) on 22 March 2013. He explained me all the package inclusions and told me the resort included is Estrela Do Mar Beach Resort, GOA(Khobra Vaddo, Near Babreshwar Temple, Calangute Beach, North Goa - E-mail: estrelagoa@yahoo.com Mobile: 91-9822219785) and it is the best beach resort MakeMyTrip is offering very close to the beach and great in its class. With great expectations, I reached Estrela Do Mar Beach Resort, Goa on 20 April 2013 by 2.15 pm. The hotel check-in time is mentioned to be 2pm, but the people at the reception were lagging the process like anything that I was able to get a room only at 3pm. I was astonished that even the main person in the reception doesn't know English(in a place like Goa which is a tourist destination) and was asking me to speak in Hindi and replying in Hindi. We were given two glasses of welcome drink which was worst than an ordinary juice. The room was ugly looking with no proper lighting and air conditioning. They have arranged some snack packets in the table and drinks in the refrigerator which was charged heavily during the check-out time. I had requested them to arrange the package trip to South Goa the very next day. They told they will be providing it the 2nd day(MakeMyTrip sales person told it's flexible and can be arranged according to your convenience) as they are doing it on Mondays regularly. When I asked the reason they told that if I have any objection, I can complaint to MakeMyTrip. Also the person at the reception doesn't even know which all places will be covered in that package trip. On Monday, I went to the reception for the package tour, they told one more person is yet to come and so the tour will be late. Also the trip as per package is having non-ac vehicle but as they are having an ac vehicle only I need to pay Rs.60 extra per person for the air conditioning. The trip got late and started by 11 am and it was in a low class tempo traveler crowded with passengers. First they went to Fort Aguada and Sinquerim Dolphin rides which was in North Goa, when I raised the question is the trip to South Goa, they told South Goa there is nothing to see and so they included these two also. I asked whether Colva Beach( oldest, largest and the most spectacular beaches of South Goa) is included, they told it is too far and they can't go there as per the instruction by the resort.The trip was totally disappointing and I came back. The resort was offering breakfast in its inclusions and it was aloo paratha, uppuma, bread and omlet.Even the paid food was non-tasty and was having very high cost. From the day one onwards, I was feeling a bad smell around the resort and later on I cam to know in-front of the hotel is a cremation ground. The day before my check- out, I told them my flight is at 4.45pm only and requested to arrange my cab by 3pm. They told it is not possible as the check-out time is 11am and I have to leave the hotel that time itself(and the MakeMyTrip sales person told that the hotel is so friendly so that you can speak and arrange the return cab upon your convenience). During the check-out time, I came to the reception and they made me wait for 1 hour and finally when I argued, asked me to sign the register. I asked for the bill and they told they don't have any bill for the stay. I told I have the right to get the bill and they asked me to obtain the bill from MakeMyTrip who arranged your stay. Perfect cheating by MMT! To an elite customer like me if they are doing this, what will be the case of an ordinary customer. I am dRajeev_Vermarately dissatisfied and would never ever take a bus ticket from MMT. Even I won't recommend MMT to another person and request you all not to waste money hearing their false, wrong commitments.",1
2766,"I recently returned from a a group trip to Andamans. The experience was very pleasant and satisfying. It was impressive to receive complete details of what all the package included prior to departure. No extra fees or hidden costs were involved.

2767,"I booked flight and hotels through MakeMyTrip.com. I received the booking id. Amount for the booking has been debited from my account but I haven't still received a confirmation on the hotel booking and invioce. I thought this should have been an automated process... First issue is I am not able to view the booking details online. This is really ridiculous in todays world on web where makemytrip advertise a lot on web booking. Secondly, when following up with the support team I came to know only the person taken care of the booking will be able to provide me with the details. I see a big risk here as its person dependent. Thirdly upon raising a complain from the site, MakyMyTrip takes 72 hrs (3 days) to respond. Waiting for 3 days for a simple query is killing....Same on MakeMyTrip for all the false statements and promises they make",1
2768,"Although I like the service of MakeMyTrip for booking airline tickets and all (always book through MMT), but I was appalled to find that their hotel booking service is TERRIBLE. The “trusted” hotels are completely untrustworthy. Be really careful! I made a booking at Hive Alwar, Alwar, Rajasthan, from 29-31 March 2013. I booked a 'Club Room' at the hotel, but I was made to stay in a 'Deluxe Room'. At the time of check-in, the hotel informed me that I would be given a ""slightly different room"" than my booking, as all other rooms are booked. Once I saw the room, I realized that it was a Deluxe Room. All the facilities were different—the room was much smaller than the Club Room, had two separate small beds (instead of one king-sized bed), etc. I checked with the reception, but they denied (obviously). I sent all these details to MMT, and I was shocked to see their response! First, the customer care guy (named Amit Govani) sent a wrong mail to me, referring to some other hotel. Obviously, a bad copy-paste job. Then, he said that my room was changed because we were two women! He wrote, “Because of two lady feel more comfortable if will find two beds rather than one bed”. Also, he said nothing could be done because I “gave good feedback at the time of checkout”. Well, what about the feedback before checkout? And, yes, I did check the “satisfactory” boxes for things like food and wi-fi! I didn't know this means that the room was ok, despite the fact that I highlighted this in the final settlement bill. It’s so shocking! I had to bring this to the notice of all the fellow travelers, who may face the same problems and end up wasting their money! Now, I know what the latest Goibibo commercial refers to…",1
2769,"*This is regarding the hotels booked with MakeMyTrip.com, their agent cheated me by saying its a 4 star & 3 star hotels where as it was not even a budget hotel & charged me for the same & spoiled my entire vacation with my parents & my Wife & kids. Two of the hotels don't have even the basic facilities lifts, mini bar, swimming pool, Wi fi, or other necessary facilities required for a star hotel. In Sunrise regency hotel there was no basic facilities lifts, mini bar, swimming pool. The bathrooms was so dirty & stinking & looks looks a residential house of a middle class person. This was not even a budget hotel & your agent cheated me by saying it a 3 star hotel. In Summit Grace hotel, Darjeeling, the room got stinking smell, water leaking on the floor, room size was very small & the shower area was about 2 X 2 feet where w.c. dirty water was leaking into it.

2770,I had booked a bus ticket from Bangalore to Ooty through Makemytrip in Greenline travel. At the boarding point the bus operator (Greenline travels) informed me that my ticket (NU27013950577590)issued by Makemytrip was not a valid one. Greenline travel simply did not acknowledge the ticket issued by MMT. Later on due to cancellation I could get 2 worst located seats for three passengers for an overnight journey at an exorbitantly high price and had to change bus midway. It took number of calls for MMT to acknowledge their fault and refund the money. Never trust this site. They should rename themselves as spoilmytrip.com.,1
2771,"Hey all, I used Makemytrip for bus booking, my account got debited but the seat was not booked. So, I called customer service regarding same, they asked to wait for 45 min to 1 hour after that only they will let me know if they can book my seat or not as my booking is under processed. But I asked them the seat I have booked is not booked yet online, what if the seat goes to somebody else. Then the best part comes, they said me then they we will return my money after 72 hours. I asked but you charged for booking and debited my account but your not assuring me anything. They didn't answer but said if like to ask something else you can ask but we will refund your money after 72 hours only. This is the poorest service I came across. There are many online other services which cooperate to customer for their problem. People be careful before booking Makemytrip they will debit your account not assure you anything, the people are not helpful at all.",1
2772,They solved my problems which I had on a tour package. The customer service rep provided incorrect info but when escalated got resolution on the same. And all the money was refunded. I got repeated calls and updates.,3

Without acknowledging that their company is cheating, he was trying to show me their large heart by the waiver which is announced in bold letters for gold/platinum customers. Use website like myspicetrip.com which can provide you excellent fare for flight+hotel combo.",1
2774,"Never do any business with Makemytrip.com We had horrible experience while our trip to Malaysia and Singapore which we booked through this company. Our family suffered severe physical assault, mental humiliation and financial loot instead of fun during our trip with MakeMyTrip. We were not provided any flight details at the time of booking. New Delhi to Kula Lumpur is just 5 hours 30 min flight. Instead of booking a direct flight MMTC booked Srilankan Airline flight via Colombo. It took us total 11 hours to reach KL. On board flight experience with Srilankan airlines was horrible. Seats were cramped and food was absurd for India vegetarians. We reached Malaysia KL airport at 7:00 AM local time after the night long tiring journey. There was only a guide available on behalf of MMTC and he declared that hotel check-in time in KL is 1500 hours and they will take us to city ride till that time. How can one expect to go on ride after such a long journey and without getting fresh? When we objected he simply said he is just a guide and is not answerable. We had to took personal cabs to reach the hotel and had to wait in the lobby till 14:00 hours when rooms were provided, and that too after a lot of follow up and request with tour manager of MMTC. Next started two horrible tales. While we were on city tour, the guide disembarked our child from the bus in middle of crowded market place while we were not there. Later when we questioned him for this, he not only pushed me but also threatened to slap my sister-in-law (government officer). The tour manager also paid no attention on this. Next day on the tour the same tour guide misbehaved and pushed me again. When my sister-in-law tried to rescue me, he punched on her head twice and abused her in filthiest language. He threatened us that he is a Mafia member and will kill us in Malaysia. Even this was not enough for these two guys of MMTC (tour guide and manager). On the way back to hotel, they stopped the bus at around at a local police station, where they had well connects. There, both of them threatened us to pay him USD 5000 otherwise they will get all of us behind bars. We tried to argue but in vain. Our kids were feeling tired and uneasy and we were continuously pleading with them that at least one of us should be allowed to go to hotel with children, so that they can take rest. Kids also pleaded them with folded hands, but it was of no effect on them. They kept laughing and making fun of us. Finally around 11.00 PM we arranged USD 2500 and paid to them. The guide was a local mafia and was not an employee of MMTC. While the tour manager who was an employee of MMTC forced us to sign an appreciation letter in his favor. We did many complaints to MMTC but instead of taking any action against those guys, they pointed fingers on us to avoid taking any responsibility. This is the story of physical, mental, verbal and monetary humiliation faced by my family, including kids, by persons representing MMTC in Malaysia, tour guide and tour manager. You could also face the similar issues as these guys are not going to change. Think not only twice, thrice but million times before you do any business which these guys.",1

They will show you 4 and 5 star hotels and names while sending the package details and once you fall into their trap change the hotels stating those hotels are full. Promised AC transfers and all drivers have to be constantly informed ""Hamara Ac transfers hai"" and Some cab drivers simply deny to put the AC on and you are helpless at that time as you have already paid. This was not only my experience but had 3 more couples whose honeymoon was ruined by them. You would rarely find anyone who would recommend this or use this more than once.

I spoke to the owner and he asked me to give him 3000 INR which he would return to me next day. Luckily I had only 1500 INR  with me at that time. So I gave him only 600 .and send my account number to the owner. It’s almost 10 days since I gave him money. He keeps telling me that he would transfer the money next day. However he never did.

2779,"Booked an air ticket for my family yesterday from Singapore to Chennai. I wanted to use my US credit card in India for booking. The air fare was 41000 Rs in Air India Express. Since Air India express site had issues taking my US credit card details, I switched to Makemytrip not wary of the consequences! Initially, when I tried to book it myself, I thought the system would automatically convert INR to USD and deduct money from my Card. But it did not. It gave me a ""Page cannot be displayed"". So I called up customer care and the lady on phone told me that the fares have gone up now but not reflected on the site yet, which is why my online transaction did not go through. I then asked her what is the prevailing fare. She said its 49900 Rs. Since I did not want to waste more time (as she gave me an opinion that the fares will keep rocketing up) I decided to book it over the call. I asked her to book it. She made the booking but asked me to make the payment myself. I got the booking ID and went to their payment site. It had two sections. One with a label that said I had to pay 975 USD. And the other, a text box allowing user input for the USD. This itself was confusing. Why should the system ask me to enter the amount ?? Then I did a small math for 975 USD which is what the site asked me to pay. Based on yesterday's exchange rate (54.8 Rs for 1 USD) I found that the rupee equivalent of 975 USD was way higher than 49900 Rs. I asked her why? She told me - Sir what do you think is the correct amount. I did the math again for the amount of 49, 900 and told it is 912 USD. She said - OK sir. Please go ahead and make the payment for 912 USD. I wondered how someone could cheat by about 60 dollars initially. But since I wanted to finish the call I made the payment. Now comes the real agonizing part. When I received my itinerary, it did not have any price. So I went to Air India express site, keyed in my confirmation number and checked. It showed me that the ticket cost was only 42 K roughly, which translates to 784 USD only! I have been calling up customer care since then to get an explanation on why I have been charged 912 USD when the fare was only 784 USD. I should tell this is one of the worst customer service experiences I have had. They put me on hold for 30 mins, then someone comes up and asks the details. He would hang up and would not call back. An SMS will be sent that the call was dropped. But nobody would bother you to call back. Finally, after 4 long hours of calls I managed to get a representative. He asks me to get the screenshot of the Air India express site with amount details. Initially he also asked me - Sir if you booked yesterday and saw an issue, why are you calling today? You should have called yesterday! I reminded him that it was the 10th time I am calling since yesterday.. They are such bad associates! Now I am just keeping my hopes alive that I will get the difference amount credited back to me. But it wont be surprising if they play gimmicks with me. Need to know if there is any legal course of action that I could take. Any ideas?",1

Then they admitted their mistake and promised to refund my Rs 2500 that they charged extra but no, they still refunded Rs 1400 and I am still trying to get from them the remaining 1100.

2788,"I was searching for hotels to stay in Mysore for two nights on Friday 29-Mar-2013 to Sunday 31-Mar-2013. Since it was long weekend I thought of staying away from Bangalore but didn't want to travel far, so just chose Mysore. After a fair amount of research I found makemytrip's cancellation policy to be good (full refund minus 250 rs if cancelled before 24hrs of check-in) so I chose makemytrip coz you never know if you have to cancel the trip at last moment. So I went ahead and booked Shree Guru Residency as it is near to many places of attraction. I paid Rs 3640/- for two nights for two of us, and even the booking page showed this data correctly. But when I received the Hotel Booking Voucher (Booking ID: NH210332618345) from makemytrip over email, I was shocked to find out that the voucher mentioned only one guest! I immediately called up their customer care and informed about the error. The cust care exec somebody by name Pooja spoke to me, and she kept me on hold 2 times to check with the hotel. Then she came back and told me I need to pay Rs 950/- plus tax to add one more person to the same booking. I told its the error from your side, why should I pay, moreover hotel charges 950/- plus tax for a single person. I have paid 3640/- for two nights that itself shows I have booked for 2 people, it’s a mistake from your side, so please send me the updated voucher mentioning two people. She told if you want you can cancel your booking but you will be charged Rs. 250/- for cancellation! When I said why should I lose 250 bucks for none of my mistake, she told she will take a request to check if this is an error from their side, took details like which browser, which OS and how many tabs were open while booking and told she would check and if it is confirmed that it’s a mistake from their side then she would send me a new voucher after 72 hours! That means she would send me new voucher after I reach the hotel, and if she doesn't send I have to pay 950/- plus tax to the hotel. I then raised a written complaint on their website but till next day (27-Mar-2013) morning there was no reply from them. I got frustrated and since I didn't want to take a chance I booked another hotel through Travelguru and cancelled the booking done through makemytrip. This way makemytrip made 250/- bucks!! Makemytrip looted my hard-earned money and caused mental harassment too. I have vowed to NEVER book anything through makemytrip. Even the travekguru booking had its own share of problems. Though they immediately sent me booking confirmation, the confirmation mail had a note saying it would take 48hrs for the hotel to receive info about my booking so I should check with hotel only after 48 hrs. I told WTF! When I contacted their cust care they told room has been blocked, it will take 48hrs for the communication to be sent to hotel, so the cust exec asked me to check with hotel next day after 12PM. She also assured there is nothing to worry, booking is confirmed, but I have to wait till tomorrow and see what happens to this booking. As another safety net I just thought and mailed the hotel and requested them to reserve a room for two for 2 nights on same dates. They responded positively and sent a written confirmation over email that booking is made. This they did without even receiving a single paisa from me. And the amount I need to pay, as per their email, was less than what Travelguru charged me by 120 rupees! Since I had already paid money to Travelguru I was not able to save this 120 bucks :-( So totally in this ordeal  I lost 250+120=360 rupees unnecessarily. :-( So my suggestion for anyone who wants to book hotels through these online portals is, try calling up the hotel directly or mail them and ask them if they can book the room and you would pay after check-in. Better get a written confirmation too if they agree. This way you can avoid getting looted by online portals!",1
2789,"MakeMyTrip - totally doesn't stand for its name. I am totally disappointed with all that happened right from booking to cancellation to refund. Here's what happened : Got a call from ""Taranjot Kaur"" (Taranjot.Kaur@MakeMyTrip.com) - a MakeMyTrip executive who handled our honeymoon booking. Numerous calls a day , and totally nagging us to forcefully give in and book the trip. ( And this was supposed to be our honeymoon trip) Then , when I put in a cancellation request for the Trip the very next day , she gives me stories that - my initial booking amount of Rs 20, 000 has been used to book flights , hotels in Thailand and for our transfer cabs in Thailand - which is an utter made up story. And here is why  I need justice on this and a full refund back - as MakeMyTrip got such untrained employees ( who are not even fit to lie or keep following the previous track of story told to me : BOOKING ID : IN1302B22313 Trip - India To Thailand (Bangkok and Krabi) can they use our booking money to go ahead with the other procedures. Then , why the hell MakeMyTrip used our hard - earned money to carry on  with the booking? (though its obvious to everyone that its a lie, as any sensible travel agent or trip organizer will only, I stress in DOUBLE QUOTES ""Block the airlines / flights"". And I hear stories of - ""Mam ! Already booked flight tickets , already booked hotel rooms , already booked cab services "". Ughh!! Give me a break. Utter Cr$p. Its your head ache , if you cant even value your customer and their hard - earned money even a little bit. I don’t know whether this is a way of making money, and if MakeMyTrip is such an organisation, or if it’s actually only because of a few incompetent and ignorant employees. The fact is that this entrie episode has left me frustrated and angry and Rs.10, 000 poorer. Not to mention the countless calls I have made to MakeMyTrip wasting my time hoping for a good outcome. First call she told me that I will be getting a minimum of only 3000 Rs as refund. Second call - the refund amount got increased to Rs 5000 (God knows from where the flight tickets got dropped). Third call - Rs 8000 ( as if MakeMyTrip is offering a job with a salary package negotiation. Uff!! ). And then all of a sudden from nowhere , she said refund amount is Rs 10, 000. I told her - ""I want my whole money back"" and she promised me to get in touch with her higher officials for the same. Next thing she had asked me was , if she could proceed with the cancellation. I said YES. ( Though she did not confirm me that Rs 10, 000 was all I would receive . Cos you know obviously - I was bargaining with a vegetable vendor and I expected a better bargain :D :D) - By the way, MakeMyTrip  I am mocking at you for having such stupid, good for nothing employees. Please do not feel happy or proud that I have included a SMILEY. The next event was shocking and a surprise to me. I was all teeth and glee. I had received a message on my mobile registered with MakeMyTrip that my booking has been cancelled. And a refund amount of Rs 17, 750 will be processed in next 7 business days. The exact copy of the message below : ""Cancellation request received for MakeMyTrip Booking ID - IN1302B22313 , Refund Amount of  Rs 17, 750 will be processed in next 7 business days. Thank You"" Now, what would you expect me to do ? I called up Taranjot and told her that I have received a cancellation message with so and so amount. And I kept Idle waiting for my account to get credited with the same. I receive Rs.10, 000 in my bank account on 12th March 2013, saying Rs10, 000 has been credited. I was wondering why only Rs10, 000 ?. I called up Taranjot and inquired the same. She promised to check and tell me. No response. I tried calling her personal number. One ring and gets disconnected. My number had been blacklisted or on call divert . And I realized it late. This is how she ditches customers. But when she wants business , she will call you and nag you to book with MakeMyTrip. The final made up story of theirs is : I receive the cancellation message on 1 st March, 2013. On 25th March 2013 , they tell me that ""Its an Automated message and the amount mentioned is wrong"" ( I mean WTH , even film directors will not be able to twist and turn and give multiple angles / dimensions to a story ). Again I try reaching , no response. Nada. Zilch. I can add on more. But this is more than enough to what kind of incompetent employees and services MakeMyTrip have. If this episode is not sorted out ASAP, I would personally make sure that all my relatives, friends and acquaintances get to know about the way MakeMyTrip treats its customers and does business. And trust me, with an episode like this not ANY of them would be very interested in doing business with MakeMyTrip ever again. Furthermore, I would NOT AT ALL hesitate to approach MakeMyTrip via consumer forums, to claim back what is rightfully my hard earned money. Not to mention the trauma I have been going through speaking to your various employees and their different versions of the procedures. And so far, seeing the outcome, I dare say some of the things they told me were blatant lies. Please understand, that this was supposed to be my honeymoon trip, but MakeMyTrip didn’t actually make it, but left a really really bad taste, which it would do well to rectify.” A very very disgruntled customer.",1
2790,"Went to visit Kerala with my sister recently and our agent took us to Mantra Ayurvedic Centre, Colony Road, Munnar, Kerala and it was complete rip off.  The room was cold, the table was cold and the lady did not offer any coverings while giving massage(kept thinking it's going to get better, but it  never did)! Their idea of steam bath was a hose hooked up to the Pressure Cooker! My sis after she came out of her massage complained to the owner as she had spasms due to cold and the owner made no apologies, instead got angry and knew words of English here and there which added fire to the fuel. We still paid him the full price!  Pl. be aware where your agent wants you to go as usually they have a personal stake in it and we will not book with Make my trip.com. in future. There is huge communication problems as people do not understand English and you can't speak their language! I'm also unable to find their site on Google.",3

2792,"Here's the way it will exploit you: I have entered all needed information (FLYFREE code) in the first ticket, then ID of the first ticket while booking the free ticket (I fulfill all other conditions). ID was accepted by system (no warning). Now Makemytip is saying I won't get refund as I entered the ID with the prefix 'ID' !  i.e. as 'ID 1234' instead of '1234'. Escalated it, and no response yet. I know what they will do now- come here to mouthshut and say the same-old-excuse that they tried to call me but could not reach. If you are running an offer, give the money back that you are advertising. Do not try to fool customer by giving ridiculous reason to reject. When code entered is right in the first ticket, you have the ID as reference in the second ticket, all is done as per your instructions; what else you need to refund the customer..? Your true intent should be to benefit the old customer, than setting a trap. You do not have grievance redress system. So, am closing all my account with Makemytrip and the associated Payback card.

2794,"MakeMyTrip(MMT) is by far one of the worst travel agencies that I have come across. Trip ID: NP2802125230933. I recently booked a DEL-GOA Hotel+ Flight package for a group of 6 people(5 adults+ 1 child). Their ticketing team made an error and forgot to issue the ticket for the child. As we arrived at the airport, the Spice Jet airline staff informed us of the issue. I called up MakeMyTrip and informed them of their error. They refused to take responsibility of their mistake and continued to transfer me between departments. This happened 4-5 times before I finally gave up and proceeded to buy a last minute ticket for almost 20k. The airport helpdesk(DEL - Terminal 1) of MakeMyTrip was abusive to say the least. They blamed the issue on me and refused to acknowledge their mistake. I followed up again with MMT during my trip in Goa but to no avail. Finally, I called up AMEX and asked them to block the payment. Needless to say, that finally got MMT's attention. They finally accepted their mistake and acknowledged their ticketing error. It's been 2 weeks(First call from their end. I've called them 10 times already) and while they have gotten in touch with me, they are still giving me the run around about refunding the extra ticket price(no refund on the credit card till date) and making useless promises about paying me damages. My single piece of advice - Avoid MMT at all costs. From my personal experience, I would recommend ClearTrip any day. If you have to book with MMT for any reason, book with a credit/debit card provider that will support your VALID chargeback requests(AMEX in my case). Update: I got a call recently offering a 1000 rupee coupon for any future hotel/flight package. Needless to say, I declined it and have requested AMEX to launch an investigation. I've been asked for all supporting documents and should receive my refund soon.",1

2802,"I wouldn't even give this one star if that were possible.  I made reservations through https://MakeMyTrip.com (the US website) for domestic travel in India from Chennai to Mumbai.  For a 5:25 am flight in a nearly empty airport, I arrived at 4:55 am and was informed by the Indigo airlines representative that check-in counters close 45 min prior to departure.  To be rebooked on a different flight, I ended up paying nearly the original amount to the airline. After Indigo's insistence that this was one of the conditions of carriage listed on the e-ticket, I turned to MakeMyTrip to inquire why these were not listed in the email communication/e-ticket.  After several frustrating conversations with https://MakeMyTrip.com, they got back saying that it was listed  during the reservation process.  I tried retracing my steps with a new reservation and saw the following note immediately after selecting an itinerary (way before confirmation or payment): ""I understand and agree with the Rules and Restrictions of this fare, the Privacy Policy , the Visa Rules and the Terms and Conditions of MakeMyTrip , Indigo Airlines,  ."" The final ""Indigo Airlines"" in the note above was a hyperlink to terms of carriage.  According to https://MakeMyTrip.com, I should have read and understood these completely and kept track of these conditions for my flight that was weeks later.  They were unwilling to do anything whatsoever!  A negative score for customer service.  I suppose they are keeping themselves covered, but shame on them!!!

2806,"This is just to let you know that despite several years of regular use of make my trip for both flights and hotel bookings, their customer care has been appalling in terms of support. This is the first time I have come across this issue, when I was put up in a hotel that was not even 10% to what I thought it would be like. I was traveling from abroad to India and after a long haul was hoping to reach my hotel asap. What was waiting for me was a utter shock, in that the hotel was disgusting and I could not see myself staying there. With a waiting taxi , I expressed my shock to the lady incharge who said I would have to contact ""make my trip"" since I had done the booking through them. I did not have a local mobile so I asked to call from their landline, which was in a dismal condition itself. Anyway, when I did get through to the customer service they said point blank that they could not do anything then but that I could take pictures and get back to them later. I checked the itinerary, which said that in case the person is dissatisfied they should let them know as soon as possible, which I did. I also realised that if I left the hotel, they would not do anything about it so I decided tyo stay and pursue this. I cannot tell you the gory details of this hotel management, but trust me it was digusting. I was so tired that I just wanted to sleep and forget everything. The one and only good point about this hotel was the location which allowed me to go to the nearby shopping mall to have my breakfast and all other meals, because the food they brought from ""DHABA"" was disgusting. Anyway, I left the hotel after having stayed for a night although I had booked for 2 nights. On my return from holiday I decided to pursue the matter and wrote to make my trip about the whole experience. To my shock they kept on postponing the matter and kept sending me automated emails. I sent the photos that I had taken and instead of being upfront about the problem, they put the blame on hotelier and said that the ""hoteliers have refused to pay any refund"", when it should be their responsibility. This is not the first time I have booked a hotel and have never complained before, but instead of listening to their customers they seem to be more concerned about making money. I can only say that it would have been cheaper to have gone directly through hotels, than through make my trip. Certainly they have misled me into booking this 1 star hotel  and have shown no regard for old customers. I am sure most of the time our experiences are good or neutral but this one appaling experience is enough for me to say goodbye to MAKE MY TRIP, to the expense of loyalty points. I am sure there must be few others like me in this situation, and I hope we can take some action against such management. Thanks, ",1
2807,"This company is very poor is serving the needs of its customers after one has paid their high service fees.  First, they sell mutli-airline tickets.  However, they have made no arrangements with airlines for a through baggage check-ins. One has to collect bags after each segment, and re-check them.  Second, if the airlines change their flight schedules they do not inform the customers.  It seems that in India airlines change their departure times on the whim.  Even the old railways I used when I was growing up in India 40 or so years ago were better - one could set their clock when a particular train would arrive or depart. My best advice is to get some preliminary onformation from this site, then go to each airlines to book the tickets.  It will save money, and some of the airines (e.g Jet Airways) are pretty good at informing about flight changes.",1
2808,"Sometimes ratings about an internet based service site are misleading as it might not reflect the true picture of its happy or unhappy customers. The same I feel is in case of makemytrip.com.  Usually what happens in such cases that happy customers do not write reviews or rate in the volumes as compared to unhappy customers. Be it a about a customer or a service, the same would be the general criteria. When people get excellent service, they enjoy it and forget it afterwards. But it is generally the otherwise state that generates pain and induces them to post negative reports and ratings. At times some companies generate dummy positive ratings in order to create a favorable picture in the mind of public. But that is not possible for all companies to do as it would be against the ethics. If we talk about makemytrip.com, it is performing quite well, year on year basis – both in terms of revenue and number of customers. There is a consistent increase in volume of customers it caters to, on yearly basis. Had it not been the case that overall their customers don’t get satisfied with their services, a consistent increase in volume would not have been possible. The increase in revenue counts for both categories of customers – existing and repeated, and, the new customers. Makemytrip.com is 13 years old company that came into existence in the year 2000 primarily as an online travel agency portal. Be it domestic or international airlines in India or abroad, hotels, or complete holiday package anywhere across the globe, makemytrip.com has a thorough professional control over it to manage and execute.  The company operates from 20 cities in India, the U.S., Canada and United Arab Emirates.  It operates on both models – B2C(business to customer or consumer) and B2B(business to business). The information system and knowledge base is quite impressive on makemytrip.com. On top of the page it educates about the change in few airlines from terminal 3 of Delhi International Airport. by clicking on the relevant hyperlink, you can find the required information. Overall the whole site is very impressive. One more very comprehensively educative link on makemytrip.com is under the section “International Airlines” where you get a list of almost all international airlines. In the list, for example, if you click on American Airlines, the new page that opens will give you a complete picture about this airline – viz its history, details, baggage allowance, destinations it covers, various kind of services it provides, fleet it carries, and finally the awards it has obtained so far. The entire international airlines listed on makemytrip.com are its airlines partners. Similar kind of detailed information you can find for Austrian Airlines or for that sake for any of the international airlines on clicking the relevant link.",4
2809,"I made the mistake of booking a Hotel through the MMT website. Once I booked the hotel, a first email was sent to me on January 14, 2013 (almost 2 & half months before the planned trip) which was with a subject line - HOTEL CONFIRMATION VOUCHER"". Also this email contained a line stating that ""Kindly note, your booking is CONFIRMED and you are not required to contact the hotel or MakeMyTrip.com to reconfirm the same."" Then on March 08, 2013 (hardly 20 days before the trip) they sent me another email saying that the hotel booking is not confirmed. I feel a big foul play here. Just because I booked my hotel well in advance, I got a cheap tariff. Now sighting the holiday season (27 March '13 - 31 March '13), they cancelled my cheap booking and made it available to someone who is willing paying more for the same room. Their  customer service agent very easily said that it is not MMT's fault, but the Hotel has cancelled the reservation. But I do not know the Hotel people. I knew MMT (or I thought I did). I was liaisoning with MMT. MMT were my point of contact, not the Hotel. It was MMT who sent me the email dated January 14, 2013, confirming the Hotel Reservation. How can they just do away with their responsibility saying its the Hotel's fault. Besides, I had made all the Travel Bookings which were not cheap and cost me a lot of money. I did that based on the Confirmation of the Hotel room. The agent tried to convince me saying you will book me in another Hotel. How can you trust these people any more. And why should I go to another Hotel, when I booked the Hotel of my Choice way before time. These people (MMT) are a cheat and I am along with this post, also filing a consumer complaint against MMT for Monetary and Mental harassment. In fact I would suggest that since now the Companies Bill 2011 allows a ""Class Action Suit"", we all, the victims of MMT should come together and file a Class Action Suit against MMT. Regards",1

I have booked my trip to Thailand (Booking ID - NN230253120423) via HDFC credit card and applied the deal code HDFCIFL as per which I should be awarded with 25% cash back on my account. Now when I am complaining to the Makemytrip.com they are saying that Deal code wasn't applied at all. Whereas I have been shown successful message also at the time of booking that deal code is applied. So I would request all to not to use such a poor and Dishonest sites.

2823,"I had a pathetic experience with MakeMyTrip.com when I booked by HoneyMoon trip through them. It was my very first booking made with MMT and I vow not to repeat the same mistake ever again. I am so upset also because it was my HM trip and when I was supposed to have a blissful and happy time with my wife, I was chasing them for my hotel booking. I booked a trip to Kerala through MMT. My Booking ID was IN1212B21355. It was a trip of 6nights/7days spanning four towns Munnar, Thekkady, Allepy and Kovalam. I gave them all my requirements, with hotel names and all other details. All the bookings were made and booking vouchers were issued. I was happy to have everything in place before my journey. But one day before the trip I received a call from MMT that the hotel at Kovalam is not confirmed and I need to agree on another hotel suggested by them (this hotel was very far from the beach). I was surprised to hear this as I had a valid booking voucher from the hotel and there was no reason specified why the booking got cancelled. I had chosen this hotel after thorough research and by investing considerable amount of time, so I was not ready to accept the new hotel. When I checked with the hotel, they said that there was no booking made in my name. This was a big surprise for me as MMT had issued booking voucher for the same without even making a booking !!! I got two such calls from MMT asking me to accept the new hotel which was not at all what I wanted to have. I did not agree and asked them to look for a hotel closer to the sea shore. But then they stopped calling me and my trip started. When the date started closing by, I got worried and started calling them to check the status. Earlier when I had made the booking I was told by their manager Rishi Sharma (rishi.sharma@MakeMyTrip.com) to give him a call in case I need any help. So I started calling him, and then I came to know that all the sweet talk was only before making the booking. I have never met such a big crook in any service providing organization till date. After making some false promises like he is looking into my case and this problem would be resolved within an hour, he stopped taking my calls. Many times he promised to fix the issue in an hour, but never bothered to call me back after an hour and never told me the status. I had to call him every time again to hear the same excuse that his team is working on it and it will be fixed soon. I was so aghast to hear the same excuse again and again. Mind you that it was during my honey moon, when I was supposed to be with my wife, physchandru021y as well as mentally. And there I was chasing a cheater who had taken my money long back but was not booking a hotel for me. I was not able to understand how come booking another hotel was such a big issue for him. Meanwhile I got to talk to another guy Mayank Verma and he too turned out to be similar cheat. I made at least 100 calls to MMT but to no avail. Since I was about to reach kovalam the next dayt, I made up my mind to book a hotel by myself. Luckily I got to talk to someone named Anand. He asked me not to chase these people and gave me other contact numbers. I talked to few more people and after a follow up of one day, when I was about on the way to Kovalam, I got a confirmation on another hotel booking which was in poovar (not in kovalam). And I had to agree to whatever they were providing me, leaving a bad taste in my mouth. That is not all. There were many more things promised to me as part of Honeymoon trip such as Flower Bed, Cake on Arrival etc. These were never provided to me and I could not ask as I was fighting for the most basic need – a hotel room – at that time. Now I want to ask MMT these questions: How can you issue a booking voucher without even making a booking? How can you promise so many things and provide nothing leaving the customer to chase for everything? How do you plan to compensate me since my Honey moon was completely spoiled because of your pathetic service? 4.  Once you have taken the money from a customer, isn't it your duty to make sure that he gets what's worth the money he has paid for? Why should the customer chase you for a hotel room? You should take all the pains for booking the hotel and informing him rather than leaving him in lurch. I am planning to go to the consumer court with all these details unless I receive a satisfactory answer from MMT on all the questions I have raised above.",1

2828,"I purchased the ticket from Toronto to Bangalore (12 Feb 2013 ) where the flight was scheduled to leave at (Lufthansa) 22:15 from Toronto. So when I arrived at Toronto at 19:00. I was told by Lufthansa they have rescheduled the flight to 18:00 and it has left. They can't help me as I have booked the ticket with MakeMytrip. So when I called the MakeMyTrip, I was told by agent Arushi, that they are also not aware of the change and I should speak with Lufthansa directly as it is their mistake. When I called Lufthansa they said they have intimated them but as a service we will re-book the flight with different airlines but it can be done by only Makemytrip, they will send the note. When I called Makemytrip they said they have not received anything so they cannot help. so I again called Lufthansa, they said they cannot book since its a discount ticket. When I called again Makemytrip to re-book the ticket, the agent Pavan said their system is down from past 2 hrs so they cannot book the ticket, at present call after 2 hrs. I got really frustrated and asked to speak with team leader Ritu, she said that she would call back after one hour. After half hour they called me and told me that we send you a mail regarding the change so we can't help you. Finally I requested the Lufthansa explaining the negligence of your agency, they made a special case for me and re-booked the ticket. Because of your incompetent agency I have to spend extra 500$ for hotel expenses miss my sisters wedding which the main purpose of my trip. This is my last business with Makemytrip and I told all my friends and people to not to deal with this agency. Since my business requires lots of travelling, I told my travelling department to stop dealing with Makemytrip.

2829,"I happened to book hotel for my trip to Goa and let me share the good and the bad stuff! Makemytrip indeed has better prices and more no of hotels available. Their tarrif was much cheaper than yatra, cleartrip and even agoda. So, my first choice next time would be MMT. The UI is good. You can sort or look for specific hotels and I loved the ease at which I could filter any hotel based on reviews / prices / location in Goa, etc. Too good here. The booking was hassle free. Things they need to improve: Customer support takes 48-72 hours to respond. Really? So much time for any emergency a customer could be facing? Try and improve yourselves here. The check-in time mentioned while I was making the booking was 1: 00 AM. I kinda felt this could be an error, but then I thought this could really be the case. 1: 00 am was write 2 places. So, for me it was confirmed. But when I contacted the hotel after the booking for some other stuff, they surprised me saying the check-in time was 1: 00 PM. So, all my planning went for a toss because I had booked early morning tickets to Goa. When I contacted MMT, they simply replied saying -Sorry! Here are your modified tickets with modified time. So they did not even feel like honoring their mistake. What if I had directly gone to this hotel early morning? Little stuff can make a lot of difference in service industry and I strongly feel that MMT can go a long way in providing better services with the better prices they already offer. Then they will truly rock. But on the whole, I will come back to MMT for future hotel bookings!",3
2830,"I booked air tickets from Canada to India through MakeMyTrip.ca. They advertised reasonably lower fares. Their website mentions that they will match the price if any lower price is found. They refused to honour this even after I was ready to prove that seats were available for the same flights on a lower fare through other website. I decided to go ahead with Makemytrip because my family and I had different travel dates but the return was the same. I did not want to be facing issues calling different agents if there happens to be a need. To further my misery, the agent entered an incorrect last name for my son. I pointed this out to the agent on the chat as well as over the phone during the booking.  The agent assured that the correct name as per the passport would be forwarded to the airlines. I get an e-ticket after following up umpteen times through several chats with several agents and the name is wrong on that too. I followed up once again with the nth number of agent explaining this whole name affair and he goes on to say that name is not changeable and I have to only cancel and Rebook. I was at pains to prove that their agent is at fault.  After so many request to escalate the issue all I got was a request to wait 48 hours. The issue is still unresolved and nobody is owning up. I cant even get a single manger's contact details to follow up without explaining to every tom dick and harry picking up the call.

Makemytrip Customer Care confirmed that since they can see the comment from the Indian Airlines against my PNR that I will be getting the full refund , I need not submit any stamped document or so.They just asked me to wait for 3 days. Its already more than a week and I have not got the refund yet. Every time I call the customer care they mention that I have raised the complaint to concerned department but there is not action taken after that. Now they say that they can not refund the money without the stamped docs from Airlines. Being a customer for makemytrip form so many years it feels really frustrating to go through so much hassles. Just hoping that this may not be my and my organizations last booking made at makemytrip. Please call me in case of any more inputs required. Expecting an early resolution. For Public: Please avoid Makemytrip as once you are in process of any cancellation or rescheduling the customer care officials will take you for a toss and you will need months and months of followup and that may not guarantee you your refund too.

I then called Singapore Airlines which told me they cant either (stupid morons) and asked me to just work with the travel agent.

2841,"We booked our International 7days/6nights holiday package for honeymoon to Mauritius through Makemytrip with booking ID: IN1211B12988. Confirmation voucher issued by make my trip was not accepted by hotel. They needed'Hotel Voucher' and not just confirmation. We were made to sit and wait for 4-5 hours at reception after having a full night tiring flight than having a room. After lot of struggle having secured a room at hotel what we got was a room stinking of dampness like a fishstall. No comforter/quilt/blanket was provided in the room even after complaining at reception several times. We spent 6 hr shivering in the room. No room service at all, no one even picked calls at reception or public relations dept. The room lacked cleanliness and basic amenities like water, quilt, towels, and toiletries. Hotel manager Swapna was very rude to the situation and in place of being helpful, she was misbehaving with guests. We saw lots of people angry, annoyed and complaining about similar situations. After continuous mails with make my trip advisor, nothing was done. They did change our room after lots of complaining. Having expected that our problems will end here, we were put in a room having fused bulbs, plenty of mosquitos, and lizards walking on dressing table and walls No water supply at all from night 11-morning 6 am and 2 pm to 6 pm even in the toilets or washroom There was no hot water in shower. No room cleaning in all 7-8 days(only bed sheet was set all days) For honeymooners hotel could not even provide a double bed, two single bed and single matresses were joined to make to double bed. Single menu was followed in restaurant for all 7days /6 nights. It was hard to find a clean table to sit for dinner or breakfast. Hotel severely lacked staffs. Only one vegetarian/Indian dish was available all days with some plain Paratha in breakfast/lunch /dinner. It was a hard life for vegetarian like us. Stale and previous day’s leftover food was served in breakfast. Had to wait for 3-4 hours for just having a bath towel at reception. There was no internet or proper working TV in the room. So called Wi-Fi available at lobby was barely working as there were too many people flocking for the net which was available at only one place. 15 While booking trip, we were being promised the following freebies as part of honeymoon package by Make my trip- a)  ROOM Decoration+ Sparkling wine, water activities(complimentary boating, snorkeling etc. provided by hotel) b)  Complimentary body spa for the couple c)  3 days full day tour with travel(north, south, island) d)  Candle light dinner e)  Wedding gift at checkout for honeymooners. However this all promises were misleading. We didn't receive any of these services. We got to know that some of the couples booked from other tour agencies received these complimentary services. MakeMyTrip supplier for our tour was AKQUASun in Mauritius. These people were bunch of goons and liars. Their full day tours was just half day and it was total disgusting, disappointing and full of mental torture Representatives at AKQUASun happen to be the worst host and guide one can ever had-Unprofessional, inflexible and unethical people. They didn’t have any willingness to understand customers’ needs. Indeed we were being openly told on our face that our work is to get you guys here by hook or by crook. Their ethics: It’s all valid to woo customers in name of fake promises for complimentary services and tour packages. One of the examples of them being inflexible is that they make us leave one of tours uncompleted and return to their coach in heavy rain as they had to leave. We all got drenched in rain some of us got caught with fever and cold. South tour and north tour was bogus as they took all clients to shopping where they can earn commission wasting our two days of time in Mauritius. Highly disappointed by these tours, we planned our own local tours to see natural beauty of Mauritius, of course by selling more money after spending so much on buying these packages. Complaining to AKQUASun MD hardly made a difference. They openly told that it’s my mistake to choose them or Makemytrip or the Indian Resort and they can't do anything about it. I should talk to my travel agency. Which I did somehow in barely working internet for getting no respite for my problems. In nut shell, Makemytrip could have done a lot(as Yatra did for other couple) to solve not all but some of the problems. I was looking forward for the best experience for my honeymoon trip however I spent most of the time asking for bare minimum services(which anyone expects) or complaining for it. It really ruined our honeymoon and I feel sorry for my wife and myself. After having spent so much money, all we got is mental torture. MakemyTrip can’t ever payback for my honeymoon but at least I owe a full refund. after filing so many complaints and writing to management no one even bothered to send a couresty reply also. they are truly cheaters",1

2844,"Complaint No: 130104-027078. I have booked a flight thru Makemytrip (MMT), booking ID:  NF2513820903654. At airport, at the boarding counter I was shocked to hear that my flight booking has been cancelled by MMT. I called MMT, the agent said, my ticket is valid, and he had no clue about the cancellation. I asked for the fresh ticket print and it did not mention about cancellation. However airline firmly told that the booking is cancelled. I was embarrassed, had to miss the flight as well as my subsequent business commitments broke down. The agent from MMT promised me to investigate the matter and assured that I would be paid for the new ticket cost. I bought new ticket of the next available flight at much higher cost. Post my travel I lodged complaint with MMT, however what I was told after 15 days was horrible. They totally disowned the responsibility of the issue, despite the fact that I booked through them and paid them well over a month in advance. They charged me for cancellation, airline and MMT fee; forget the re-imbursement, causing me financial loss. The horrible thing was, under the name of investigation, they shared an IP and told me that booking was cancelled thru this IP address from somewhere in Mumbai by going on airline website. And since its done from the airline, MMT is not responsible for it. In short, it looks like the transactions from MMT are not safe, and anyone can cancel your journey tickets anytime causing you big loss.  Or it could be a hand in glove operations by airline and MMT , as the said flight was delayed / cancelled on that day, possibly because the lack of ticket sale. So beware and think before you buy ticket from MMT. However after 10 days post travel date, I received the SMS for ticket cancellation, which looked like triggered due to someone changing the data from their system. So somewhere, either Airline or MMT is playing with the data, causing passengers loss. 5.   It means if you buy ticket through MMT, you are not guaranteed the seat. As airline may cancel your ticket anytime and you will never know. 6.   The worst part is MMT would not take the responsibility of such issues and would leave you in soup. Financial Loss = 3200 (Original ticket cost) + 6450 (New ticket cost) + 10000 (Loss of business due to cancellation) Total = 19650 Rs.",1

After putting me on hold thrice, she told me to click the deal link in the mail, and to surprise me the terms and conditions were altered for the travel date. The new valid date was ""22nd Dec 2012 to 3rd Jan, 2013"". I could not believe it, when I asked how it is possible to do a booking with a wrong deal code, she had no answer. She simply said you did not read the terms and conditions. I read all of them, I know:-), even my family member and one of my friend was their at the time of booking, they also remembered about the travel date clause. How can a company like MakeMyTrip commit such afraud. They cheat customers in name of promotions. Please don't use MakeMyTrip. They are not trust-able. If anybody who has got the cash back under this offer, please respond on this review with detail.",1
2848,"I had done hotel booking through makemytrip.com this was hotel room in Solapur. I did get an email confirmation from makemytrip stating that the booking is confirmed and I need call the hotel to reconfirm. When I went to the hotel after 5hrs of drive from Pune, the hotel receptionist and then the owner stated that there was no booking in my name. I was shocked I showed the hotel owner the email and he said he has nothing to do with it, he wasn't ready to contact the makemytrip guys. I had to call them and inform them about the situation each time they said that a representative will call back in 30 mins, but I didn't receive any call, this way I spent more than 3hrs in the reception lobby making several calls to makemytrip representatives, finally I got hold of one Mr.Abhijit Deshmukh from makemytrip, meanwhile the hotel owner gave me an option wherein I could check-in for the night but had to vacate my room at 8:30am in the morning as he had guests arriving and come back only after 4:30pm in the evening. I told Mr.Deshmukh this option he pleaded with me to check-in for the night and said he will look at the other alternative for the next day. Also he stated they would pay for the room, and because of all the inconvenience caused they would refund me my booking amount. The next morning we left the room at 8:30am but I didn't receive any calls from makemytrip, I tried several times but in vain. Then I launched a complaint and since then have been chasing it upto the management level, they did say they will look into the matter but then I got one email from them that since the hotelier had served the basic facility they would not refund. I feel I am cheated I had paid the full amount at a premium and I could avail the facility against my payment. I was o n a holiday and because of the stress it didn't feel like one. Can you please suggest how I can take up this case with consumer court ? It is not just about money it is about accountability. Regards, Samir",1
2849,The most Pathetic Customer Care I have ever Come across. Interested only in making False promises and making money. As* HolEven the Managers and Supervisors are big time cheaters.

2850,"I had the most horrible time in booking my honeymoon and during as well. If they had give proper advice and had been more well informed and organized, me & my husband would have saved 4 days and 1lakh of mistake. Mind you, our honeymoon was for 10days and 3.5lakhs!! f they had briefed us on the travel time, distance of hotel from airport etc in Paris, we would have definitely taken it out of the list of cities!! The first trauma was, they had booked aisle seat for both of us, which means we had to sit apart for our 7.5 hours of flight from Qatar to Paris. Since the flight was full-house, we could not request to shift together. Then comes the actual Paris part!When I had asked about the distance of hotel from major tourist spots, they said its very close. When we got dropped off, it was so shocking!! Its was 24kms from Eiffel tour! I spent most of our time and money traveling into city and back to the outskirts! With all that cab fair, I am sure I could have afforded a 5star hotel in the heart of the city! The next major dram was in the Athens airport. When we reached our pickup was not to be found. When we contacted the provider, makemytrip had shared wrong flight details and timings. We waited a full 2 hours in the airport for the pick!! What a waste of time & money!! Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT ever use their service!!",1
2851,"This is the most pathetic customer service I have ever talked to. They only know how to sell but CANNOT/DO NOT know how to honour their commitment. Whats surprising is even the upper management is like that and no one seems to have a clue. I booked a trip to 5day trip to kerala in Dec (IN: 1212B125**). The payment was made upfront for hotel and cab bookings well in advance. The sales guy tried to upsell the hotels by saying that the hotels I was interested in  are booked and wanted me to book in the other hotel he was suggesting. I dodged one but agreed to another without checking (my bad). I have proof (a screenshot 2 days later) showing hotel rooms available in the original hotel that I preferred. Now comes the worst part. I was surprised that makemytrip deals with such shabby vendors. CAB VENDOR: INFOTOUR Designers After I reached Cochin, I was made to wait for 4hrs at the pick-up point and after a bunch of calls, a Tata Sumo was sent instead of Innova and that too from a different tour operator. No proper reason was given for the delay (basically the Innova was given to someone else or not booked in the first place). This entirely ruined my first day of the trip (drive to Munnar) resulting in having to travel in night on ghat roads. This was by far the scariest night of my life. Then while on the trip I get call from the other tour operator demanding full money for the Tata Sumo that was provided to me. Luckily for me my trip included the place where their office was located, otherwise I would have had to shell out this money myself. I went to their office and settled the account with the other tour operator and asked for a refund for not providing me Innova. A meagre Rs 1500 was paid as difference for 5 days. I made a complaint to makemytrip thru all the steps on their website and no proper response. From my perspective, I held makemytrip responsible as the payment was made to makemytrip. If your cab vendor is InfoTour Designers I suggest you rebook your trip. These people are of the worst kind and do not bother to answer their phones during business hours (Anthony Peters: 09497731526, Rajgopal: 09895880142). In short do not fall for the makemytrip advertisements etc and you are much better off making your own bookings via yatra or expedia.",1
2852,"I have been a regular user of goibibo and I was very satisfied with goibibo . But on one such unfortunate day I decided to book my tickets from makemytrip.com. I was trying to avail an offer from HDFC bank and by mistake I entered a wrong code. I assumed that if it was wrong , the website would give me an alert or pop-up, like others do eg goibibo. It didn't give me any alert and I got my tickets booked without availing the offer . That was straight away loss of 700 bucks to me. The website should have handled the wrong code in a different way. A simple human error cost me 700 bucks . In this era of such efficient technology , they should have atleast systems with minimal intelligence. Worst first experience.

2855,"Based on our passed experience with similar travel agency I decided to make a booking through Make my trip hoping we will get professional  service with reasonable rates for booking, but it was totally opposite.  We started holiday from 11th to 15th Dec.2012. We faced following issues: How come a professional organization like them can book a holiday trip of 8 with luggage by innova for 5 day trip? My complaints about this Resort: Hotel is very far off from Munnar once landed u become isolated and impossible to change hotel. Hotel is substandard worse than dormitory. Very few staff compared to the size of hotel so forget services. Poor quality furniture, holes in roof, no curtain in bathroom window,  flies in dining area, even for one chapati you need to wait for 30 minute even if there is single family sitting in dinning. Some lamps outside rooms doesn’t work & it becomes very scary in the Night. Manager does have manners to talk. No regular cleaning in the rooms, Bed sheets remains dirty and no cleaning of the room even if you request for it. Room booked in Kovallum beach resort was standard room in 5 floor down from reception with no lift, With my family with 4 senior citizen (Age was given to them) how u they  expect them to reach them to go to room from reception and come back to restaurant at 1 floor down with reception . Secondly they booked standard room, there was hardly any difference in room rent of standard and deluxe but deluxe room were far better with accessible with lift. So although hotel was good we had a miserable time. Driver cum Guide was not knowing about tourist spots and opening, closing time so courtesy driver cum guide we missed all the major spots. Although driver was very cordial. We complaint to themi about munnar hotel on 11th  similarly Kovallam hotel room issue on 13th but we only receive call from make my trip concern Department on 14th evening which was of no use as we were going by 15th . Surely now onwards we wont book through Make my trip",2

2861,"Like any other salesmen, the guys at MMT too are hardsellers. Once they get your money, you are left to fend for your own. I had booked a honeymoon package to Mauritius. The first scam was unearthed when I realized that the free spa that I was promised could not be provided because the hotel DID NOT HAVE A SPA.. Didn't the MMT guy know this earlier? And the biggest surprise of them all - the name of the hotel was Le surcouf Hotel & SPA.. The spa existed only in the name of the hotel, not in reality... The MMT salesman - Safvan Mansuri - had assured us that the lunch on Day1 would be free. But the discourteous hotel staff simply refused to acknowledge this..And we ended up paying for the meal. We dropped mails to Safvan from Mauritius itself, but it seems he did not have the inclination to help us out.. After all, we were no longer prospective customers.. MMT might advertise cheaper fares/packages, but trust me, it is not worth the hardship/ dissatisfaction you'll face.. You'll only end up feeling cheated..",1

2864,"I booked a trip to Kerela recently. Starting from 23rd of December 2012 (Sunday) to 28th December 2012 (Friday). My trip design was Kochi (1 night) - Munnar (2 nights) - Thekkady (1 night) -> Allepey ( 1 night) -> Kochi. The evening I landed in Kochi I was very much impressed to have been alloted a nice, beautiful and spacious room in ""Quality Airport Hotel"". After staying at this hotel my hopes soared sky high and I started to feel great about the trip. This was the 1st day. 2nd day => Next morning I started my journey to Munnar and after spending some good time on the roads I reached the hotel in Munnar. The receptionist gave me a warm welcome and I felt good within. Within few minutes he took me to the room and lo ""I was in a state of shock"". That was the only room available for the next 2 days. It was a very very small room. Even then we consoled ourselves and looked positively for the coming few days. Munnar has a chill climate - At night, I asked for an extra blanket. You know what ???? The blanket was smelling. However, after calling up the reception they gave us another blanket which seemed fine. After the day's trip I wanted to freshen up and went to the bathroom only to find that there was no warm water. It was fine with me and my wife, but, it was not fine for my young kids!!! We can manage but, not the kids. The reception guy told me that warm water will come after leaving the tap open for 15-20 mins which never happened. Then when I complained again they mentioned about some problem with the geyser. By God's grace we got some warm water next day for the kids. Thanks to the Almighty ! The food was bad, food delivery took a long long time even though they said that it will be delivered to the room in 30 mins. Upon calling the restaurant they said ""You are not the only person staying here, there are other 19 rooms who needs food"". Believe me, I never set any time expectation, however, they themselves told me that it will come in 30 mins. Somehow we stayed there for 2 nights. 4th day => We reached Thekkady. Now, guess what ????? Upon reaching the hotel, the manager in the hotel told me MMT has not released the money and so he will not let me in. My wife and my kids (young kids, one is 6 yrs and the other is 2 yrs old) were standing beside the road. Just imagine, after trying to convince the manager saying that I would pay him money if he lets me stay there. Then he agreed to it. Then after lot of hardships I could get connected to the customer care dept. I told them the issue and when they spoke to the manager, the manager said I don't have to pay. Then I was taken to the *only * room left in the hotel. The room was worse than that in Munnar and the flush tank was not working. I complained about it after sometime and by God's grace I was given another room where things were working. But, remember, the room was not good. Somehow we decided to spend the night and move on. 5th day => En route to Allepey, I called up the hotel (rather homestay) and the gentleman told me that MMT has not paid and hence he would not entertain me. Now, the biggest pain started. I could get in touch with the customer care after 2 hours 30 mins (In between multiple calls got disconnected) . You cannot imagine the trauma I had to go through this time. After speaking to the customer care lady, she escalated the issue and I got a call back from MMT and they arranged a stay in another hotel. Thank God ! Interesting points are: 1. I paid for the hotel booking on 3rd December 2012. 2. Even after 20+ days the non payment of dues 3. Before I started my tour, I called up the hotels and tried to verify if booking in my name has been done. In none of the hotels it was done. 4. I had to call the customer care 'N' number of times to get the booking done. Even after calling numerous times, it was not smooth. 5. They told me at the time of booking that all the hotels are at least 3-star. I can agree only with the 1st hotel in Kochi that it is a 3-star. 6. Before I paid for the booking, I got multiple calls from MMT. After paying, I had to make calls to get the things done. After all these, I decided never to opt for MMT again. I was planning for few more trips to Europe, US, South Africa, Thailand, Singapore etc.... Now, I will have to visit other companies for all my future trips. But, to look at the positive side, I learned by the hard way in my own country. Had it happened in any other country then God knows.. From this bad experience, at least I will make my verification even more stringent for my future trips. Thanks MMT for giving me a chance to learn !!!",1

While generally the standard of customer support with most service providers is nothing to write home about, makemytrip is definitely in the bottom half. first of all each representative would put me on hold for very long, and then the call would get dropped.

2866,"Hi all, Could we unit together and punish this fraud(MakeMyTrip). Else these guys will continue doing these in future too. Particularly Bangalore folks, If you already suffered from MakeMyTrip can we take these matters to the press. Recently I booked a travel ticket from Bangalore to Coorg through makemytrip. My booking id is NH261212240736, booked in my name (Sibabrata Sahoo) on Tuesday, 18 December, 2012, 9:44 PM. The guest house I booked, that address was, Stewart Valley, Coorg, Near Vartha Bhavan, Stuart Hill Road, Madikeri, Coorg, Coorg, Karnataka, 571201. The contact person for the guest house was Mr, Naveen (9900777377). The booking was for 2-days from 22 December 2012 - 24  December 2012 for 5 peoples and the money that I spend was Rs. 13, 814 using my credit card. When we reached there on 22 December 2012 by 4PM and contacted Mr. Naveen, he directed to some other guest house. It was difficult for us to know the guest house name immediately because when we asked for confirmation about the name to Mr. Naveen, then he replied that you are at the back side of the house and the name board is available in front side. That is the reason we went inside of the house and few time latter we found the guest house name is Hill Valley in Mangaladevi Nagar. This was not the guest house we booked for, so we started communicating with MakeMyTrip customer care 1800 102 5506. Many times the call was disconnected and some times they replied Mr, Naveen will reach you, in next half an hour. But Mr, Naveen never came back to resolve the issue. By that time Home Valley house owner came to know about the fraud and demanded the money from us. Because we could not able to afford paying money again, so we back to Bangalore on next day 23 December 2012. Before starting back to Bangalore I talked again to makemytrip customer care and found they are unable to help in that emergency condition. I reached bangalore on 23 December 2012 night and on 24 December 2012, I placed a call to makemytrip to refund my paid money as well as all the lose that happened during the trip. They said they need 12 hr to resolve. For proper co-operation, I extended the time till 26 December 2012(10AM). I did not got any call back by that time, and when I called back again, I found they do not have any intention to work on it. They could not able to give me any decision about refunding my money.",1
2867,"We planned a (luxury) trip for the Golden Triangle (Delhi-Agra-Jaipur) from makemytrip adviser for a family of 4+1 (Myself, myspose, myson (3+) and my in-laws (Father and sister in law)).  The trip was decently priced for 4Star hotels and fully covered road trip and sightseeings. I lost my first impression of the tour when I landed in Delhi airport and did not found anyone with my nameplate in hand, while we ware waiting and trying to reach Makemytrip to assist us (long wating roaming calls :(  )!! Finally someone from the after sales team, asked me to be on hold again, as she will try to trace the driver. After sometime she gave me the driver's number and asked me to call him, when I found he was waiting in the parking plot of delhi airport. When I asked him to come for a pickpu, he asked me to come out from the airport to the parking lot ( we had to pull all the luggage along with my 3 yr old son and the driver online) !! Finally, I meet the driver and was shocked as he is supposed to be with us for the next 6 days. He was a young chap may be 22-25 max, lean like a broom stick, spiky hairs, jeans and Scars over his faces, My instant reaction was - some criminal from Tihar Jail.. and I had to be with him for next 6 days with 2 young ladies and a child. Cant explain any further.. simply the whole journey was a mess, due to his terrific rash driving, his arrogance and filthy behavior. He was not even sure on the end to end itenary and only knew sight seeings and road trips, whereas the vehicle was supposed to be on my disposal from the time of my landing till the last day. When we asked him to drive out to some local areas of Delhi, he explained that he is doing a favor by taking us their... !!!! Makemytrip's after sales agent did not even bothered to revert on my complaint for this behavior to my surprise! (Jaipur- Delhi 255 KM's covered in 4 hrs with stopover of 1 hr) . He never told us anything about the local places, not even which food joints are good to go.. I short, please avoid any domestic trips from MakeMytrip.com.",1
2868,I tried booking a ticket yesterday afternoon and I choose the 11.45 Bangalore to pune flight  and paid for it and was very surprised that I got booked on a different flight which was later at night. I thought initially I had made a mistake but when I called up makemy trip the person  at the other end was surprised that there was a flight to pune at 11.45 am and I had to take a screen shot to convince him that I was telling the truth. I asked them to cancel the ticket immediately nerd refund me the full amount. The call center employee has promised me that they will refund the full amount but I am still not sure about this. I was told that it might have been a server error that has caused the mistake. I have attached the screen shot here. The am not convinced that this was a genuine error and I feel that there might be other people with similar experience.,1
2869,"I would strongly advice people to not make any bookings for hotels or package deals through Make My trip. It is nothing but a nightmare and complete frustration. I wanted to book hotels for Ahmdabad, Udaipur and Mount Abu so I called up their toll free number, one sales guy came and gave me some hotel details and also told me about the price for it. He gave me some IDs through email and asked me to pay the sum (here that's the mistake I did), I should have asked him complete hotel details in writing (email), like double room, A/C room. To pay the amount 20k he called me up some 5-10 times and finally trusting makemytrip I paid after which nightmare started. For first 5 days no reply from anyone, when I tried calling they said they are working on it, some of call centre people, in fact asked me why I did not get  hotel voucher (as if I have kept the same on hold). Finally 7th day I get voucher after some shouting and escalating to authorities. Story is not ended here, they gave me standard room and when I crossed checked with hotel people they said the hotel per day is just 1500 and these guys charges me 3500 per day. I decided to call up makemyrtrip again and ask why they charged me so high, like a fool one guy told me that the rates keep on fluctuating, which looks funny as christmas time and how can rates slash down to half, I did not believe makemytrip, again called up the hotel, they said be it Rs. 1500/- was their season rate and its same for all. I again called up Makemytrip, this time I was furious as you have to tell the whole story again and again to every new guy, funny part is their auto tool free number ask you for travel ID and verification, still every time the call center people again ask you the id and they put it in their system first, it takes another 5 minutes and your patience level is tested. Now makemytrip finally gave me sales team number and asked me to speak to the seller (sales person from Makemytrip) I called that guy, firstly someone else came on line and told me he was on leave and they had no clue on what he has booked, what the heck I said. So after 2 days I again called the office, that guy came to office and he realised some screw up he did on rates, so he said either he will refund the excess amount or book a delux room. Next 2 days I kept calling and again same response, we are working on it. I still haven't received the updated voucher and how I wished I could have directly did the booking from hotel website. Here are some tips if you wanna deal with MakeMy trip Do not trust the packages written in website Call up hotel to cross check if booking is been done. I would highly suggest book it through hotel website rather than going through the frustration while booking from MakeMyTrip. Here is a suggestion to MakemyTrip, if anyone can pass it to them You guys require a process change (What website shows and what you get is completely different) Be crystal clear with customers, build a trust with them as you are running a customer service company, couple or bad feedback or word of mouth publicity makes a lot of difference Make your call me facility more user friendly, its really annoying, it is not at all usable. I hope after reading this you will not make the same mistake which I did and know the goof ups which makemytrip do Wish you guys a happy holidays and a prosperous new year in advance Thanks Gopi",1
2870,"It was that make my trip is one the best travel Companies in India, However I have got an Incident to share with everyone and l Lost my trust on makemytrip or it taught me a lesson not to book with an online company. I with my family(my wife, My 2 sons, a daughter In law and my Grand Daughter who is 1 years and 9 months old) to Churu, rajasthan and once I made the booking I checked the booking with the hotel as well. But the time I called the hotel, the hotel didn't had my booking and I spoke to a representative at makemytrip customer service team and they re-assured me twice of the booking and finally they sent me the re-confirmation vouchers as well. I reached the Hotel(Sun City Palace) and the staff at the Front desk and later their G.M(mr yogesh) said that they have not got any bookings under my name and they helped me in connecting with makemytrip representative but makemytrip people actually never sent the booking to the hotel. I waited for 2 hours and felt humiliated and was Harassed by the representative from makemytrip and I requested them to arrange the accommodation somewhere else but they are not able to do so, instead the hotel(Sun City Palace) people  were more helpful than makemytrip representative a guy from their contracting team(Chirag arora) promised to get the complete booking amount paid to makemytrip back to my card as well as asked for the bill for the new Hotel room that I booked and He would get me the amount refunded to me as a compensation for the Humiliation by their people, harassment to me and inconvenience caused to my family(my wife, My 2 sons, a daughter In law and my Grand Daughter who is 1 years and 9 months old) and me. When I tried calling this guy(Chirag Arora) to follow up for the complete amount status almost after a week, He said he's not responsible on answerable to me and can't do anything about it, I'm highly disappointed  from makemytrip and would suggest no one to book with them.

2873,"Problem is we guys dont check review of online sites before spending money with them. If we have to buy a mobile phone or car or ac, we come online and check reviews and thats why on most occasions we know pro & cons of product before buying them. I wish I had visited this review page on makemytrip before making bookings with them. There are many problems with makemytrip 1.   Hotels star ratings are incorrect, never believe makemytrip rating, 2.   Makemytrip rates & hotel rates differ, Once makemytrip rate were lower than actual payment I did to hotel but on another occasion hotel rates were much lower than makemytrip. 3.   Dont buy their special deals, they show false price and high discount, in actual hotel rates are low. 4.    Makemytrip booking system may book room even when unavailable. 5.    100% money back guarantee is BIG LIE, you will not get any money back under any circumstances. I have used some good deals also from makemytrip but the bad deal costed so much that it was not worth using this site, and thats why I decided not to use them ever.",1

The connection flights and the ferry connections are completely misaligned. They don't respond to email complaints, neither do they answer calls to their toll free number. I am completely disgusted with their attitude and recommend no one go through them even if their package appears less expense. Highly unprofessional people. Is there any regulatory body which keeps tab on such businesses? Thanks, Deepti",1
2875,"I cancelled ticket for BLR to PNQ and return by GoAir for travel on Nov 17(onward) and Nov 20(return) booked through MakeMyTrip. The refund amount that MakeMyTrip claims to have credited to my card a/c is Rs. 4421/-(have an SMS from MakeMyTrip). The amount received in my a/c is Rs. 4039/-, and there is a difference of Rs. 382/-. I have been following up with them for last 3 weeks(Complaint No. 121114-011686, and there are many more. so I am not listing them here) to credit the additional amount. I have sent details provided by my bank(ICICI), and still there no response from their end. I am deeply frustrated at MakeMyTrip's handling of this situation, this despite me being a ""Gold"" rewards customer. Please note that this is not the first time I have had an issue with MMT. In Mar, 2012 I used their service to book Sterling Resort at Ooty on the eve of my 5th marriage anniversary. After a long 10+ hours drive to Ooty from Bangalore, we realized that there was an issue in the hotel booking, and Sterling Fern Hill at Ooty declined to provide accommodation. Finally, I settled for an alternative arranged by Sterling, and also lost Rs. 1500/- in the process. I had lodged a complaint with MMT(ID: 120326-007808) immediately, but no response from them. It is my firm commitment to no longer avail MMT's service anymore I think there are better alternatives now.",1

Sales person Chandramohan came to the picture and compelled me to commit 10, 000/- even before sending me any final itinerary. he insisted to do the payment as he is working out for some 2000/- discount for the package. I trusted on the brand MakeMyTrip and committed the 10000/- [Rupees ten thousand only]  hoping that the service promised will be at-par and will be up to the promise.

I am disappointed and dejected by this through unprofessional way of service from Makemytrip. I had sent an email but there is not reply yet from their end. the support staff are so poor in communication and talks so informally really annoying. I will update here on this. based on their response. I will be writing to their CEO as well. Thanks Sailesh.",1

They keep transfering my from one department to other or telling my stupid jargon like ""Sir, the the request has been placed with the concerned team and they will contact you as soon as possible"" ""withing 24 hours"" with no one contacnting me back in a week. I keep calling them and they keep putting me in queue for 30-40 minutes. My 1100$ are still with them. They said they have processed the amount and my band should have received it, but no, no one has received anything. They won't tell me what account they sent it to or any details. Stupid.",1
2878,"I had made hotel booking in Trivandrum 15.11.2012 for the date 19.11.12 to 21.11.2012 (2 Nights) through make my trip- MakeMyTrip Booking ID - NH210292279483. It was written on the confirmation voucher that my booking is confirmed & I need not to contact hotel or makemytrip for reconfirmation. When I reached the hotel, they denied me the entry & told me that they have communicated to make my trip through e-mail on 15th Nov-12 itself that there is no such vacancy on the booked dates. After reaching at the hotel, I was denied entry & was standing in the midnight on the road & calling helplessly to makemytrip for the alternative arrangement of hotel. After three hours of struggle & pain, I was finally told that make my trip has booked a room for me at hotel White Dammer. I took a taxi & I checked in the newly arranged hotel at 4.30 AM in the morning & a voucher was sent to the hotel & me. The day was full of inconvenience to me as whole night was washed out by the reluctant & reckless attitude of makemytrip service staff. I missed one important meeting with the customer on the following day & complete purpose of the travel to city was wiped out. This proved a major financial loss to me. Again my miseries were prolonged by makemytrip. I thought that I will sleep second night peacefully but at 12.00 clock midnight I got a call from hotel that make my trip has not paid to & I need to contact them for payment, otherwise I will have to pay again to hotel from my pocket. I called make my trip & two hours were wasted in the communication in night with makemytrip service staff. This night was also a pain to me because of make my trip. In the night makemytrip service staff promised that they will make the payment to Hotel early in the morning & I need not to pay. But when I went at reception for checkout, hotel informed that they have not received any payment & make my trip has stopped responding to their correspondence. It was a real humiliation that I was kept waiting for the payment delivery from you. Make my trip mailed hotel not to take payment from me on the promise that they will make payment after 10 AM. The hotel kept my luggage as security against payment default from make my trip & allowed me to go on business call. Again all these things delayed me & I missed another appointment with customer on next day also. When I came back in the afternoon to collect my luggage, I was shocked to know that still make my trip has not paid to the Hotel. I was forced to pay again",1
2879,"Dont trust make my trip people. They are cheaters, provide false prices of tour packages and in the last time or final booking time they just simply refuse the prices by saying that it was a mistake and also management is not ready to take any responsibility for the commitment given by their travel expert. They are simply useless. They kill your time, you will lost all the good deals....be aware",1

H-000301293 dtd 09-11-202 from Makemytrip executive Mr. Mukul Raj by email. Our flight reached in time at 13:30 at Goa. To my horror, our name did not appear in the guest list of pickup van of Hotel Terra Paraiso at Goa Airport.  On contacting makemytrip executive he told that rooms are not available at this Hotel and an alternative shall be worked out within few minutes. I was made to wait outside Goa Airport with my 9 yr & 12 yr old Kids till 15:45 and Hotel arranged was 45 Kms away from any Goan beaches. The entire joy and purpose of holiday was wasted due to faulty services by makemytrip and caused immense agony and helplessness during the trip to the whole family. My complaint no. 121120-043708 dtd 21-11-2012 has not been responded so far. The incident seems to be a preplanned case to lure customers by booking them for desired hotels & later shift them to undesired locations without any ground. Do not get lured by tall claims of Makemytrip of good memories unlimited. Most of the chance is to get BAD MEMORIES UNLIMITED.",1
2881,"Don't ever book through this website !!Tried to book airline tkts and the website messed up the booking. Only 3 passengers were booked out of the 4 we wanted. After that customer service is even more worse. They keep transferring you from one ""Department"" to the other and they have no interest/ way to help you or sort your matter. On top of that they still charge you cancellation fees on a booking made wrong by their faulty website. Don't book through Make my trip website.. You are better off going to the website of the airlines itself or be prepared to loose money !!!",1

2883,"I created an account on mouthshut solely to write a review on make my trip- Coz it was the WORST EXPERIENCE EVER IN MY LIFE! We booked a golden triangle trip through make my trip. We were contemplating between Thomas cook and Make my trip and one more agency(don't remember the name). Since we were told that there isn't much difference in the overall popularity among these three, we decided to go with the cheaper one. I still don't want to remember the places where they put us in. In Delhi, they placed us in Hotel Grace. On the first day itself, they gave us towels which were unwashed. Reason- the laundry guy dint come for the past few days. The toilets were literally brown/grey in color. The beds were unclean, the food was soooo expensive and the water tasted bad. We just  hoped that we could get out of that hotel as early as possible. The second hotel that we spent our night was in Agra. It was the better among the three and it looked descent from outside but the food was terrible and when we opened the toilet in our room, the urine smell was so strong that we had to call the lobby to get it cleaned again. Even after cleaning, the smell was still there but I guess, had reduced a little bit so that we could at least get in. The third hotel was in Jaipur. Our driver was pretty knowledgeable about the three cities but even  he was saying that he hasn't even heard about this street where the third hotel was. Finally we reached the hotel. Trust me guys.... Even in our college days we used to go for much better hotels than these. Now that we went on this tour with our family, there was hardly any space left in our rooms after placing our two luggage. The only good thing that happened through this agency was the driver that we got.. He was a smart chap. I guess if he wasn't there, we wouldn't even have found the hotel. I don't know if all agencies are like this but would never ever ever ever go through make my trip. I had gone through some bad reviews before the trip but then thought that it would be like this for all agencies. Many people will write good  things n some people, bad stuff. I guess I was wrong! With my experience, I would strongly recommend that you try some other agency or even booking on your own as that comes out to be the cheapest and it is definitely not as difficult as we think it is. I will pass on my message to as many of my friends as possible coz I dont want anyone- anyone for that matter- to go through this experience again- Make my trip should never repeat this experience with ANYBODY ELSE!",1
2884,"I booked a hotel+flight ticket for jaipur for 2 adults and 1 kid..Makemytrip wrongly booked 2 adults to jaipur and 2 kids to Jaipur. Based on the screwup , their customer support guy adviced me to book my own tickets for remaining and get it refunded. Now makemytrip is refusing my claim and blames me. They are just plain cheats of 3rd degree. Please do not fall prey to them. No ethics at all",1
2885,"I book a flight from Toronto to Amritsar. On the way coming back my flight was canceled I call make my trip, they say they will call me within 24 hours, I call the 8 times every time the answer was same, but never get call back from them. they didn't help me in anything for my booking. Then I change my flight by contacting directly to airline, I talked with their manager Princess rai, she promise me to give me call back but she didn't. And they didn't refund my money back for the cancelled flight. So I recommend to everybody plz don't buy any thing from the make my trip, its a fraud.   Zero customer service",1
2886,"Had booked a bus ticket for 3 (for Poornima tours through make my trip). On the day of journey when I reached the boarding point (which is unsuitable for families to walk through), bus operator told me they don't have bus in that route that night. In turn he offered me to go in some other route! How absurd, I want go to place A and you want to take me to place B? Meanwhile drunk people started misbehaving with my family outside and when I intervened I was asked what are females doing at this time in this area! This must give an idea how insecure this travel agency and area is. And most of the crowd was silent and the goons tried to manhandle me and we had to rush out of the place in a rickshaw. make my trip doesn't have any idea about the operators or their location or service for which they are booking tickets. MMT doesn't take that responsibility also! When I requested MMT for a refund they told ""We contacted bus operator and he informed us that bus ran on time according to schedule"". MMT asked me to contact bus operator directly for refund. Forget refund, I am not setting foot in that gully ever again. How are we responsible to contact bus operator when we booked ticket through MMT? No decent person can argue with a low quality bus operator. Overall I want to suggest all my friends here never to book bus tickets through MMT. You will be seriously compromising your and your family safety by using this service. If you are in Karnataka then always use KSRTC, they might be expensive a bit, but they are safe.",1
2887,"I and my husband wanted to book only hotel in thailand & hongkong. so I went to make my trip office in pune at dhole patil road... I had spoken to some represetative named vaikhri there. after calling her I told I wanted these hotels so please call me back. she dint call me, I had to call back , she dint even apologise for her delay.. how shameless.. then I went up to meet her and finalise things, I asked for a hotel in macau, first she told it will cost me 28, 000 for 2 rooms, I was surprised to hear that, so cheap ????? to that she said yes we have the best contrcted rates.. and after sometime she said sorry it was for one room and not 2 rooms, 2 rooms will cost 55, 000. So much of mismanagement and confusion she created. her colleagues priyanka and others were also not very helpful but infact rude with us. priyanka started explaining vaikhri  how to check status and availablity infront of us, she would have done this once we leave. what professionalism man !!! vaikhri was so not interested to serve us, she was in her own world, taking so much time to tell things we asked. she was not very knowledgeable. I was so sure of booking the hotel there itself but seeing such attitude we dint feel like. I told her that we would get back to her till eod, till then please do check for the hotels, to that she replied ok, but she dint even call us for asking. what a follow up make my trip... no welcoming pleasant approach, no smile , very disappointing. One girl sitting infront of the entrance in the corner seat was indeed very welcoming and pleasant , she directed us towards vaikhri. We wish we could have dealt with the same girl. We were disgusted and upset with the service so booked the hotels online on bookings.com.

2889,"They say if you don’t know about the business do not get into it. Here I am quoting make my trip who claims hey have the lowest hotel rates and bluffs us. With the belief that they are giving us a fair price we also like other bakras booked our hotel in Goa after discussing that it’s the lowest rate which is Rs.2790 compared to the rack rate of 3000 which is claimed to be the actual, this hotel claimed to have swimming pool, wifi and other blah blah’s. I booked for three nights and I land up in Goa to check in to villa fathima. First shock: it is just a bunch of cottages built, so small a room that we had difficulty going inside the room through the door, absolutely no facilities not even room service. Swimming pool I believe was a bucket of water. Ok let me not crib on these smaller issues I had a bigger issue which is absolutely not acceptable I land up in the hotel to see the their rack rate is only 2000 bucks and for non ac its only 1500 bucks. Imagine how we have been cheated clearly with proof, we took the pictures of it kept calling the customer service even before check in there is absolutely no response or any help provided for our grievance, we even took the trouble of staying in the same place an extra night only for the bill of 2000 bucks so that we can prove we have been overcharged and hence need our money refunded. The worst part is in the bill they provided to me they have even written MONEY BACK GUARANTEE POLICY: >> *If the guest doesn't checkin at the hotel due to a mismatch between amenities and inclusions mentioned on the MakeMyTrip website and those at the hotel, they must notify the claim within 24 hours of the checkin date. In this case, the guest shall be entitled to 100% refund, subject to MakeMyTrip validating their claim. In case the guest has stayed in the hotel for the entire period of booking, they must notify the claim within 24 hours of the checkout. In this case, the guest shall be entitled to 100% refund Now why the hell they printed this for? Now look at the responses they have given to me on mail We would like to inform you that the prices on our website are fluctuated and dynamic. It can be raise or reduce anytime. There may be increase from INR 2, 000 to INR 2, 500 or may be reduce from INR 2, 000 to INR 1, 500. Additionally, you was charged the amount which was updated on our website on the day of your booking. MAKE MYTRIP ARE BIG TIME CHEATERS IN THE NAME OF TIE UP THEY ARE EATING MIDDLE MEN MONIES, THEY DON’T HAVE A NEGOTIATION POWER TO EVEN GET THE REAL PRICES, WE COULD HAVE JUST GONE WITHOUT ANY SUCH FRAUDULENT BOOKING AN GOT A ROOM AT 1000 BUCKS LESSER. PLEASE DON’T BE CHEATED, DON’T EVER BOOK HERE. I fought for my hard earned money and have failed, don’t get cheated this way.",1
2890,"I have come across mixed reviews about MMT. My experience with MMT....read on... THE TRIP: I and my family were planning to go for a holiday to Maldives.We had visited several websites with lucrative offers, we ended up settling with MMT Maldives 3N 4D package.My great husband booked these tickets from the Ahmedabad office( I had a tiff with him as to why he didn't book the package from the Mumbai office...hushhhhhh.husbands I tell you....that's another story altogether!!) I had my set of differences with Chandni (she was the Senior Sales Executive who had been co-ordinating with me and my husband) regarding payment.But in the end it was all sorted and upon my continuous request, she even gave me United Colors of Benetton vouchers worth Rs 2000 absolutely free.....I was happy. We all were. We had booked this trip well in advance( as good as 3 months). We were all geared up to fly on 22nd October 2012 early morning flight 02 50am.We waited anxiously.Finally, the D day came. My husband and I kept reminding each other to remove the ticket printout but we both were busy and didn't remove it till the end. ALL WAS WELL-UNTIL DISASTER  STRUCK On 22rd October 2012, I did all my packing and FINALLY removed the ticket  print out.What do I see? To my shock, horror, disappointment blah blah whatever you may call it....I realized my flight was scheduled on 22rd October early morning at 02 50am;which means we were suppose to be reaching the airport on 21st OCTOBER NIGHT.WE MESSED UP.BIG TIME.What do we do?  I was stunned .How can we be so careless:( MISERY AT ITS BEST I immediately called up Chandni and informed her about the whole story and how we missed our flight.She was also shocked.More than me! We called up Sri Lankan Airlines both corporate office and airport number. Since it was a Sunday, corporate office was shut and the airport counter number was ringing.Chandni spoke to her Senior Sales Exec Mr. Bhavin and informed me that all we need to do is go to the Mumbai airport Srilankan airlines counter and tell him we missed the flight.They will charge us a penalty and airfare difference which will be around 5k  to 6k p.p. and then we can take the next flight for the same time.But to our dismay we learned that my father in law and mother in law's tickets were useless as it was non refundable. So baschandru021y we were suppose to buy new ticket (round trip) for  my in laws and for me and my husband we had to pay the the fare difference and airway penalty.We were not all OK with it;but since we had already made up our mind to go...we decided to pay up for it. We, had to pay approx. 50k gross.We were upset with our foolishness and were also upset with Bhavin and Chandni  since they didn't inform  us at the time of booking that my in laws ticket is non refundable. I and my husband rushed to the Mumbai airport, we had decided to buy new tickets for my in laws pay up for our fare difference and take the same flight but for the 23rd October. We frantchandru021y began searching for the Srilankan airlines counter at the airport and realized that :THERE IS NO SRI LANKAN AIRLINES COUNTER AT THE MUMBAI AIRPORT!!! Now what do we do???How do we buy tickets.....we returned home and called up Bhavin and asked for his help.It was Navratri time.We made numerous phone calls to Chandni and Bhavin.Not even once they hesitated in receiving our calls. He advised us to buy new all 4 tickets for round trip because: 1.We had to buy our inlaws tickets any which ways since they were non refundable and non changeable. 2.Since the BLOODY AIRLINE COUNTER didn't exist  how do we change or pay for our ticket change.. MMT TO THE RESCUE: Bhavin told us that if we buy all four new tickets then he can try for the  maximum refund...for all four tickets....We were so confused and disappointed , we decided to go with the flow and purchased new tickets from Akbar travels ( Bhavin told us that he can book it for us but since we thought it was just another money making gimmick, we didn't book it through MMT) We bought the tickets for an exorbitant amount of1, 34, 000/- (Ouch)and finally flew to Maldives. MALDIVES FINALLY: We reached Maldives.We forgot everything.All the troubles, issues, frustration, anger were swayed away. My experience from here on....grab a tub of pop corn and read on:) Adaaran Rannalhi Hotel- Beauty personified.I have never seen a resort so beautiful ever. Interiors: Typical beach huts.A complete beach feel.Lovely and spacious rooms.Each beach bungalow room and water bungalow room had a theme.Cleanliness was a very important protocol.Rooms were spick and span. Food: Yummy. Multi -cuisine buffet.grilled chicken was to die for! They assign a table to you.You don't have to run around with your plate and catch one.I was impressed on this one actually. Beach Activities: Snorkeling equipments, glass bottom boat ride, etc a paradise for any beach lover. Ambiance:Romantic.You will not  hear ""chaw-chaw"" .Its bliss. Staff: Friendly and courteous. Overall experience: Fun-tastic. Thank you MMT: We had the time of our lives there. MMT did full justice in giving us the top -of- the- line hotel and an excellent package. When we came back, Mr. Bhavin gave us a refund of approx 73k....(which was nearly the ticket amount ) .Honestly We didn't expect it...since he gave us refund for all 4 tickets including my in laws ticket.(which was non refundable.) It was celebration time....we lost on our one day hotel booking.We had lost all hopes of recovering any money back- but we did recovered.Quite a bit. We have now booked another trip via MMT to Bali, Indonesia and looking forward for it .We have not approached the Mumbai Office.We have decided to stick to Chandni. We thank them for the refund and going that extra mile to help us. . Cheers to MMT ....as far as Sri Lankan airlines is concerned....F%*#$ you. LESSON WE LEARNED: PLEASE REMOVE YOUR TICKETS IN ADVANCE .MUCH MUCH IN ADVANCE. This whole goof up was completely our fault. MMT had no role in this.They could have straight away told us you manage and  we would have lost on our trip.But, yet Chandni and Bhavin went out of their way to get us our refund back.thanks guys.For all those people out there, S*#@ HAPPENS. FINAL VERDICT: We all fight...we have our  own set of differences .Sometimes we decide not to speak to them ever again.We don't give chance to people.We should....you may be surprised what people can do when we given them a second chance.Once we argue or fight , both the individuals come to know what either of them like and dislike..both the individuals know what is the trigger point in the opposite individual...I feel its better to deal with old enemies rather than building new ones...Isn't it? Thanks MouthShut_Official.Thanks MMT. Have a great day!!",4

2892,"Please Note (for those who are yet to avail MMT services): I would personally request all of you to write a review as soon as you have a good experience with MMT since most of the time the reviews are written only when the experience is bad. I am extremely happy to inform that the experience with the package trip which I have booked with MakeMyTrip was way beyond my expectations. (North India customized package trip). This ofcourse is with due respect to those who did not have the same experience though. First of all I must say that the quality of car (which includes cleanliness, leg space, safety etc) was excellent. We were promised an Indica as per package, but instead they provided Indigo (bigger car) without charge. The timeliness and attitude of Driver was very nice. And if I say about the hotels, it was the nicest experience. I got good response from the hotels (NOTE: 9 hotels in total during the package) even before checking in, and the rooms and facilities were excellent. I would like to thank the whole team of MMT for this. I had asked MMT to book 3-4 star hotels for me, and that matters  in a package. Before accepting the package, I had consulted the websitehttps://mouthshut.com/websites/MakeMyTrip-com-reviews-925031929and it had huge number of demotivating reviews about MMT (550 + with ""1 star"" rating). I still believed and trusted MMT and am glad to have done so.",5
2893,Please dont trust their customer care I was told a promo code so that I will avail a discount of 500 INR by a lady and a man back to back but it seems that promo code was not a promo code and a waste. Then why did they tell so. In Munnar booked a hotel room only to find out the hotel was fully booked and had to move into a shabbier hotel and had to plead with them to give a better room. In Allapey again a shabby Boat which looked no where near to the pciture. They say report to us the problem in 24 hours. So are we there to enjoy or report on stuffs? Please dont go through them we have better sites than them Like Hotels.COM or EXPEDIA.,1

But it is now 20 days, I didn't get my refund back.Makemytrip company says they have initiated the amount from their bank and asked to check with my banking company but bank says they didn't any payment or any type of transaction from that company. Then makemytrip gave me some bank reference number and ARN no. to check with bank. But Bank officers said, we don't have any tool track the transaction with this numbers. it is impossible to track the transaction. then I again approached the company with the issue but they didn't replied. I have contacted them atleast 10-15 times, but my matter is still unsolved. My Rs 9600 are still in the company. and I want them back. I want to sue the company in consumer court.

Ltd. 103 Udyog Vihar, Phase I Gurgaon - 122016 Haryana My reply - It has been 19 Days now since, I cancelled my tickets but I didn't get the refund. Is this type of service you provide to your customers. I don't think that MakeMyTrip.com has international level of service and you're operating as a multinational company. I have contacted your team atleast 10 times by mail or by phone. and right now I am feeling harrased from cheesy reply from your team. They say that they are working on it, but I think 19 days are still not enough for them to refund the amount of your customer. I don't figure out, how do you manage refunding thousands of daily customers refunds. Then as well this is my last time I am approaching you by mail, otherwise I have to take legal action against your company. Please take this seriously. and refund my amount for following tickets.

When I called the carrier, they said they will be fine as long as they get a correction. When I called makemytrip back, this time I was told rudely that this cannot be corrected and I would need to cancel this ticket and rebook another ticket! When I asked to talked to a manager, they just hung up on me! Clearly their customer service desk is staffed by people who are either not monitored or are trained to be crooks.

2900,"The worst booking service I have ever seen. I booked my flight for an emergency travel to India due to death in the family. I was not sure of the return, so I asked to give me the local (India) customer service number if at all I have to change the return flight. They gave me the local Toll-free number. Later, 2 days before the flight, I found, all the flights are cancelled due to Sandy. Here is what happened. They suck!!! Event: Due to Sandy, Dulles ariport was closed and UA published clear guidelines ont their website ahead of time, saying customers can change their flight post Nov. 3 2012 if needed to avoid the storm. My call: I called at least 4-5 people to change my return flight 2-3 days after. I spent at least 8-9 hours waiting in call and speaking to different people. Makemy trip response: a)Initial repsonse was, my flight was booked from US and the local customer representativ cannot do any thing about my itinerary. b)I asked them to trasfer my call to international booking, they said, they both have two different extentions, they cannot transfer. Local one has 4 digit extention, and the international booking had 5 digit extentions and the department is different. c)Two said, they do not have clear guidelines (waver codes) from UA that is why they cannot do any thing time being. We are speaking to UA an they will get back to me after the waver code is confirmed. d)All of them took my local number saying, we will call back in one hour. Neither they called nor sent an e-mail. e)I said, do not worry about the waver code, I just do not want to fly during the storm, and I would like to change the return flight. They said, there will be $300 charges and the difference in the rates. I said, fine, cameback and said there are no flights available. We cannot do any thing at this point, please leave your number and will call you back in 45 minutes. Event: Time passed, 8-12 hours waiting for a calll from makemytrip. I tried again as my last call, 6 hours before the flight. Their response: Now they say, the flight is within 24 hours of the scheduled departure and itinerary is in control of airport authority and they cannot do any thing. Suggested to contact airport authority, local AI, and Lufthansa because my documentation is with them. Event: Now every thing changed all of sudden despite calling them for last 1-half day. None of those numbers given to me were working.  As a final try, I called my wife in US and asked her to call the UA and lufthansa to change my schedule Surprise: When my wife called Lufthansa, he was able to change the itinerary in few minutes and confirmed (two international flights) the return flight 2 days after. There were no charges, and No questions asked, because, he knew, there were no flights to dulles due to Sandy. Then left with local flight from HYD to Mumbai, I called local directory service to get the AI numbers and called them to change local flight to Mumbai to match with international flights confirmed. Now every thing is set in 30 minutes. Dear Makemytrip: You need to learn a lot, otherwise do not offer international bookings, your stupid service made me loose entier day and lot of stress. I will never book tickets from makemy trip again. I hope you will go thru the above events and make it better for other people who get stuck in India for poor service.",1

2906,"Here is the feedback I had sent to them. I am copy pasting it here. All I got in response to this feedback was an auto generated reply which said they cannot get me any refund. Any replies I make, I keep getting the same mail again and again. Booking ID: IN1205B09947 Trip date: June 4 to June 8 Package name: Spellbinding Kashmir Booked by: Pranav Wahi of Makemytrip. Day 0: (June 3rd, day before the trip) I checked my tickets and hotel bookings. The trip was for 4 nights, the first and 4th night stays were to be in Srinagar, 2nd night in Pahalgam and 3rd night in Gulmarg. The flight back was from Srinagar on the last day. But the hotel bookings were done wrongly such that the first 2 nights were in Srinagar, 3rd in Pahalgam and 4th in Gulmarg. I called up Pranav and Rajinder to get it fixed. He said he will speak with the cab driver and the schedule will be adjusted to the hotel bookings. I told him that it would be okayONLY IFhe speaks with the cab driver and got things fixed. Day 1: June 4 in Srinagar We reached Srinagar. But the cab driver was still having the wrong schedule. He said he had no information from makemytrip about the change of schedule. I had to call up multiple people to get the new schedule to the driver. Also, my flight on last day (June 8) was from Srinagar at 7.30 AM and my last night hotel booking was wrongly done in Gulmarg. I learned from people there that it would be impossible to get to the flight from Gulmarg. If we were to get there, we will have to drive at 3AM from Gulmarg to the airport. I called up makemytrip. I spoke to Pranav first and asked him to change my last night stay to Srinagar. He said he will call back in one hour. But never had a call from him after waiting for hours. I called up makemytrip again. Getting a connection itself took lot of time. Then Pranav was not available and I had to speak to another person (Virendar), tell him the whole story again. He also said that he will call back in an hour and he never called back. My entire first day was wasted trying to contact these guys. Day 2: June 5 in Srinagar Never got any contact from makemytrip again. I tried calling Pranav’s mobile multiple times. He never picked up. Some times he just cut my call. Then I tried calling makemytrip office. Pranav and Rajinder were not available. I spoke to their supervisor (Virendar). Again I had to tell him the entire story, he gave me the same assurance that he will make arrangements and call me back. Then he also went missing. Again I tried contacting makemytrip office. Getting a line itself was difficult. Sometimes I get connected, but they just put me on hold for 10-15mins. After about 2 hours of trying, I was able to connect to Rajinder, who again gave the same story of making arrangements and calling back. I had to spend about 4 hours throughout the day while on trip just trying to get things fixed and no one seemed to care about the seriousness of the problem. I was going to be without a place to stay for the last night at Srinagar. Day 3: June 6 in Pahalgam I decided not to call back makemytrip, because it was going to be the same old story. So we just visited around Pahalgam. This was the only day of the trip where I actually visited some places. I never got a call from makemytrip. Day 4: June 7 in Srinagar According to the modified itenary, I was supposed to do site seeing in Gulmarg on this day. But because I could not stay overnight in Gulmarg and had no place to stay in Srinagar either, I decided not to go to Gulmarg and instead go to Srinagar and find a place to stay.We reached Srinagar and had to go to lot of hotels looking for a room. Finally we found a room and I had to spend 2000 rupees out of my own pocket for the same. No sightseeing on this day too. Day 5: June 8 Srinagar to Bangalore Managed to get to the flight in time. I was happy that the horrible trip was finally over. It was the worst possible honeymoon trip anyone could have. Completely ruined by the careless attitude of your guys. It looks like you guys think your job is over as soon as you have collected the money from us. I cannot believe I paid 40000 rupees to you guys on this trip. In reality, only day 3 was the day that actually felt like a holiday. In all other days I was stuck there trying to fix the mistakes you guys made and you guys had absolutely care about it. I spoke to Virendar on this last week. He apologized and he would call back with a compensation. Then again he went missing. Same old story. I chose makemytrip over other travel agents because I expected that you guys would be more professional and will take care of all things ahead of time. But I came to know after my experience that you guys have absolute zero professionalism. You dont care about what is happening to the travellers on the trip. You dont care if we are stuck without a place to stay. It feels like makemytrip is about just paying too much money for nothing. I had paid 40000 to makemytrip and 2000 for the hotel booking that I did myself. The actual worth of the trip is nothing more that 5000 rupees. After all this I spoke with Vipin Adhikari who got me the refund of 2000 rupees for the last day stay that I had paid out of my pocket. I wanted more refund because I had paid for a trip to Gulmarg as well. But I was never able to go to Gulmarg because of the bad planning. I was not able to get Vipin Adhikari on line again. So I spoke with Virendar 3 or 4 times. Every time he kept telling that he will check and get back in 2 days. But he never called back. A week after this Virendar stopped attending my call. Someone would pick the phone and when I ask them to transfer the call to Virendar, they would just cut the line or they would keep me waiting for a long time on phone with no one answering the call. Once I could hear Virendar speaking with someone thinking that they had already cut off my call.",1
2907,"Recently I had been to North India trip which I unfortunately booked it through makemytrip. I clubbed more places in Rajasthan with Golden Triangle package. They blindly book hotels, cabs and airtickets without any synchronization. The very reason for booking this was, I wanted the whole trip to be well organized and I don't have to sit planning all the details.  Instead, I had make numerous calls between hotel, cab to synchronize, ended up paying lot of tips, guide fees, parking fees, ask people and use GPS for driving directions and also synchronize the places to visit. Even the hotels were not upto the standards. They were planning to book the airtickets through kingfisher airlines even when things were running bad with them. I canceled that and booked myself through Indigo. Also they book that without considering the actual time need to arrive at the city and checkin at the airport. If I had opted from them then I had to leave the hotel 2AM in the morning to arrive at the airport. They don’t tell upfront that they provide only a cab driver and not a guide. The cab driver had no clue about the places he was taking us. He was blindly dropping us at the entrance and go back to sleep.  At multiple places in Jaipur and Jodhpur he was reluctant to come exit gates quoting extra kms or parking fees. Infact the person who called me to get the feedback about the entire trip disconnected in the middle of the call. I really disappointed with their service. So be wise and plan your entire trip by yourself. Never book from makemytrip. Instead you can get the hotel info from their website and book it self.",1

But they did not give me the ticket, and are not processing my refund for the past 15 days. The same tickets I had to buy 3 days later by paying more money to other agents. I have even written to the senior management, but it seems they are too busy to loot other people. They just dont have the intent to return the money. I have spoken to them atleast 7-8 times in the past 15 days. Even after mailing to their CIO, there is just no urgency shown from their side. For all the travelers who want peace of mind, please dont book your travel on MakeMyTrip.",1

I have never seen such worst and abysmal site and booking experience. :( These guys are so pathetic that even I cannot submit the complaint form because I cannot see the captcha below. Its not working. To make things further complicated, when I called there customer service, they told me that booking is under processing and wait for 45 mins.

When I called their offices in Gurgaon and Chandigarh, some of their executives simply disconnected the phone without answering my questions, which is very rude, or they kept telling me nonsense like'I will get the money after I complete my journey' or' I did not enter the voucher code' or'since departure city of one of the flights is ex India, I am not eligible for cashback' or'I must call SBI'. I also called their office here in Bangalore, but they simply said they can't help me. The offers on the MMT site are very attractive but my advice is - PLEASE BE CAREFUL of them, especially with online transactions. They can try to cheat you. I don't think I am ever going to use this MMT again unless really necessary.",1

I confirmed deal for Rs.98000 and now Chd to Delhi & return flights will cost me around Rs.30000, thus taking my package to Rs.128000. Now, after paying 50% advance, I came to know that there's one Indigo flight at approx the same time and with much less fare from Chandigarh to Goa. If I had booked this flight along with Hotel independently without their help, I would have done it in Rs.108000.

Faced several issues due to your bad services 1) First of all we must tell you when I reached the hotel, the hotel representative Mr. Baharat told us that there is no confirmation of our booking from your end. Then we made several calls to your customer services, after that we were allowed to stay there which was quite annoying for us face such kind of problems where as we had already booked our room on 22nd of June. 2) At the time of booking we had clearly advised your representative Miss Ragini Srivastava that we require an ac room with in the budget of Rs2000-2500 per day. She advised us 2 to 3 hotels in the same budget for ac rooms. We liked Hotel Bharat. And so proceeded accordingly with the booking. If AC was not there then your representative must have told us at the time of booking that in your budget AC room is not available. Then we were to deciede what to do...but how can she make us fool by saying that Hotel Bharat is one of the hotel that is providing us AC room with in our budget. And here in this case only AC was not the issue... the room was in such a bad condition that no one can live on there for a second what to say about staying there for 2 days..... You cant imagine how we stay in this hotel for two days 4) We did not found the room condition actually the same that you had displayed on your website.The room was in very bad condition. It was stinking badly. Bedsheets, pillow , pillow covers were so dirty full of stains, all over the room fungus was there. All around bed spider web was there. IN SHORT ROOM WAS NOT IN ANY CONDITION THAT A HUMAN BEING CAN SURVIVE THERE FOR AN HOUR SO I HOPE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HOW CAN ANYONE BE ABLE TO STAY THERE FOR 2 DAYS!!! (ATTACHED ARE THE PICTURES OF ROOM FOR YOUR REF. TO SEE HOW YOU MADE OUR TRIP SUCCESSFUL!) Our holiday was completely spoiled because of all this nonsense that we faced we again tried to call your customer care services and spoke to miss she told us that the room will be cleaned with in 10 mins but no such action was taken. Then after wasting our so much of time and money on phone with your customer care services we stopped calling you people. But we must tell you it was a very bad experience.",1

2919,"I saw a group package for Thailand on MakemyTrip portal. I thought to enquire. The travel professional of MakeMyTrip whom I interacted with, she told me only 3 seats left on that particular date. I liked the package, so I trusted her words. She asked me to pay 10K as the advance. On the portal it was written that the package cost was 35700, but she asked for 36700. When I asked her the reason, she wasnt able to answer. I told her if she dont give me the package at the Site offer price, I wont book then. She then send me a payment URL where it was written that I have to pay Rs 34990 only. When I asked her about the amount, she said that is a technical difficulty, I should pay now, later they will change the total amount. When I insisted to change the amount to 35700, they changed the amount. Then  I paid 10000 as advance. As I never used makemytrip before, I asked her to send me the details about the flights etc. She said she would come back to me on the next day. That NEXT DAY never came. I called her number of times on the phone number she gave me. But she never picked up. I contacted customer care. They told me they would ask her to come back to me. But she never responded. The payment URL they sent to me, nothing about the trip was mentioned there. There were no facility to cancel the trip even.  Then 1 month before the trip date, a man from makemytrip called me and told me, the cost of the tour would be 36700 and they will be altering the amount on my booking. When I asked the reason, he replied that my earlier travel specialist didnt know about the price etc. I found that they already increased the price by 1000 on my booking URL. After few days, again another man from MakeMytrip sent me a mail where he wrote that my pending amount is Rs 35700, and I paid only rs 1000 as the advance. Just imagine the height of unprofessionalism and mistakes after mistakes.  When I had written back to rectify the mistakes, he sent me a mail and called me up. When I asked him how many seats left on that day, he said 10 seats left. Just imagine the lies these representatives tell their customers to book the packages. Now, I found that Bangkok is having severe flood, I sent them several mails, if they are postponing the trip and whether they can customize my package so that I can go on other date after the flood is over, they didn't even bother to respond on this. They just dont care. Because they have got Rs 10000 for their lies/mistakes. After all you have to work hard to tell lies to others. I wastes my booking amount (rs 10000). But this has taught me a lesson. I would never ever use makeMyTrip for any reason, . What a fraud company it is. It even doesn't deserve 1 star.",1
2920,I booked flight+hotel for Lucknow. I made the payment and the payment was debited from my account. But the website redirected me and error came for booking. I called up MMT but they said to wait for 3-4 hours. nothing came and I called again this guy told me the booking is not processed and they will refund my money in 7 working days. I told him its urgent and the flights has to be booked now the same package is for 19800/-.

2921,"For our Kashmir trip we booked tickets through MMT. This include both hotels & air tickets. For return, they booked flight ticket from Srinigar to Delhi and then Delhi to Kolkata, since there was no direct tickets available to Kolkata. Fine. Now the problem is the arrival time in Delhi and Departure  time difference is not more than 1hr. How can someone come at the arrival section collect all the luggage and then move to the departure section of delhi airport get the boarding pass and security check of all the family members and get the flight when you have less than an hour time. Also there is always a uncertainty when flights come back from Srinigar ( weather conditions, security etc) to reach on time. How can someone book so illogically & without common sense. So I need to change this timings here comes the 2nd story. The worst support you can imagine. Each time you call a new executive will pick up and ask you all the details & your issues and they will get back to you, but when ? its never. The call will also get disconnected automatically and no one will call u back. You have to redial and repeat your details issues again to someone new. In my 1st & last experience with Makemytrip probably I had to call them more probably some 40 times. Please avoid this agency. You will same you time, money and unnecessary harassment.",1

The airline has a medical clause under which bookings can be rescheduled for upto a year, but that is not the case with make my trip.

2927,"We took a trip to Malaysia earlier this year and after a long discussion, were promised discounts when I myself showed them the rates that hotels were quoting on their own website. Anyhow - that was ok but I wanted to travel through a travel company to save myself from visa stamping and planning issues. Surprise 1 - With my passport with them for stamping, they said I would ahve to pay extra because my passport expiry was near. I told them  I had raised the same issue before advance payment and they had said - they would manage it. After repeated discussions, they finally agreed. Surprise 2 - On a connecting city to Malaysia where we had city tour included in our printed itinerary, their Malaysian tie up agent refused flatly - said Make my trip had never asked them for the city tour. Showing them printed copies of travel plan didn't help. Had to call up folks back home to call and tell them the issue and after 4-5 hours - they responded saying they would contact their tie up agent and get one arranged. Spent Rs 1000 on ISD calls, my relatives had to take the trouble of speaking to them on my behalf at India and 1 full day wasted at our hotel at Malaysia because of this. The next day - we were taken on a city tour by the same travel agent who had refused earlier but not the one promised by Make my trip. They said time was too short to go there now. So - because of Mkae my trip's poor planning - we didn't get to see what we set out for, wasted 1 day at the hotel and also spoiled our moods besides spending extra money on calls, waiting for responses, topping up internet charge time to send emails to them at our hotel. Pathetic.",1

I at one point asked to talked for the supervisor and my call was transferred to the so called ""Supervisor"", I later found out that he was just another agent and not a supervisor. This really talks about the organizations reliability and trustworthiness. I was really put off with their lies and deceit and more importantly I had to shell out Rs 1, 30, 000/- for additional tickets because they were not willing to help.

2933,"We booked a trip to Goa through MMT. Till we made the full payment they will listen to you and respond to the mails but once the payment is done then there wont be any response. I would sent at least ten mails to my booking agent asking about our tour details. There was no reply. The customer care people did not seem to have any other reply other than "" I will ask your booking agent to call you within 24 hours. His shift has not stared yet and we do not know exactly what your booking agent has planned for you"". Before I made the payment I used to get call the very next minute but after I made the full payment not even a single return call  was made. I asked my booking agent's desk number promising him that I will call only in case of emergency but he did not reply to that. Somehow after reaching Goa my husband managed to get the number of the booking agent as we had to talk to him for rescheduling a day's trip. Only once he was able to speak with that agent. The 2nd time we called it ringed for sometime and then they had disconnected the call. It was engaged for the next 2 days.The hotel they had booked was as shown in their website. The only best thing that happened in that tour was that hotel stay. Sight seeing and airport transfers promised by MMT was provided by the hotel. So there was no use in they claiming it as holiday package when they actually did nothing for us..oh yeah they did..They had scheduled a visit to a spice plantation and there for no info about it till 1 pm in the afternoon on that day. As mentioned we were not able to reach them and so lethargically the booking agent sent a mail by 1.30 pm that only entry would be free and no transport would be provided and they asked to be there at the plantation by 2!! The hotel staff were very kind enough to make arrangements immediately for us. We wasted one full day because of MMT. U need to carry your lap top and broadband device with you throughout the tour because if u want to actually talk to anyone in MMT u need to chat with their agent as if u inquiring for a new booking, make him call you and then ask him your queries!!",1

2935,"I booked a Taj Mahal trip from Bangalore with Make My Trip.  I specified what I wanted exactly - the hotel I wanted to stay at, the things I wanted to see, the need for an english-speaking guide, and for transportation from the airport in Delhi to Agra and back. The price was acceptable.  Yes, I could have saved myself a few rupees by managing all this myself, but I would have had to spend hours doing the research, and the markup was not outrageous. After providing my credit card, there was a long delay before the information was provided.  I had to ask three times before I finally had all the information I needed for the hotel, transport, airline, and guide.  I never did receive the name of the driver, but since he was waiting with my name on a placard, that is forgiveable. The hotel was excellent.  The guide was excellent.  The driver was excellent.  In short, this was a once in a lifetime trip, and was coordinated perfectly by MMT. I have read many of the negative reviews, and I do not dispute them - I only say that my experience was positive overall, and I will book with them again if the opportunity arises.",4

I called him after an hour and asked him that time he said ""yea initially I told you it will be xylo type but afterwards, I told you about bus"" but its a lie and I told him that.. that its a lie.. he then said he will send me the recordings of telephonic conversation I said sure as I knew he never said bus or tempo traveller or group of 11 people and he started convincing me tempo traveller buses are good there is nothing to get upset ad blah blah. Its like I wanted apples n he sold me oranges n then saying oranges r also good for health. I was really pissed and  till date he haven't sent me any recordings. I am still pissed with these MMt people. MMT are really fraud, cheater. please beware of MMT. Anyone who wants to go to valley of flowers trek can visit https://gio.in they are vendor of MMT for this trek and this gio people are really good and transparent.",1
2941,"For my Kerala trip which I booked through makemytrip, they pro-actively suggested me to relax and sit back if I have not booked a cab (I had not booked a cab before this so called relax mail which they sent). They gave me an 10% discount on cab booking for my drop to airport. I booked the cab (East Cabs) through the link they provided. I got confirmation mail, confirmation voucher, I took a print of the voucher to be handed over to the cab driver and relaxed (As they said). My flight time was at 2:20 pm and I received SMS from makemytrip that cab details will be sent 1 hr before booked time (12:00 pm). So I was expecting driver details at 11:00 pm after. Waited for 10 mins, 20 mins, 1hr. Even at 12 pm (which is my cab pickup time) I did not get any info on the cab. I called up easy cabs or make my trip to find no one answer me. Finally I thought I will have to cancel my trip at the end. At 1:00 pm I had to search in road for any cabs available and pay huge amount to him for dropping us to airport. And I had to board my flight at the final call. So the so called Relax mail from makemytrip was not at all a welcome and it nearly killed all my trip plans. One sincere suggestion to makemytrip. If you can't keep the word then don't say it.  Hoping to see positive response from makemytrip in future. A disappointed Traveller at the start. But once I got into the flight. The Trip was awesome and thanks for all other arrangements (Hotel, Local Cab, etc).",3
2942,"I planned my holidays for Mysore on long weekend and booked 2 rooms in Hotel Mango Suits with Makemytrip without a miss I called up the hotel and confirmed if they have received my booking from Makemytrip which they denied. I forwarded them the booking slip and got confirmation. Surprisingly, the next day on my arrival there were no rooms in the hotel and hotel staffed asked us to stay in an apartment. I tried some other hotels but unluckily all hotels were booked in lieu of long weekend. There was no support from Makrmytrip. We had no option left but to stay in the apartment provided by hotel staff. My questions: Why 3 rooms were out of service in Mango Lounge? Why Makemytrip didn't support me when needed? what about all other service which one gets in a hotel were missing in apartment? Makemytrip spoiled our holiday. Me and my guests were left with no option in a other city to stay in a pathetic apartment without service committed.",2
2943,"We chose to book our vacation with you and we decided on European Dream Summer Package on the 14th August, 2012 from Mumbai. Booking ID IN1207B07884. We were asked to send the documents required for the visa which we did in time, including the bank statement with a bank balance as mentioned by your representative. However, in a few days you get back to me asking to show more balance in my account and which I did and sent a copy the same day. I was promised that there would be no problem with the Visa and would receive it on the 10th August. August 10th evening I was told that the visa will be confirmed only on 13th August, a few hours before my flight.I requested for a change in the departure date to 21st August, 2012 as I was not prepared for any last minute changes or rush. I trusted you, and booked my flights to Mumbai as well, I took the risk of the amount I paid for the tour + the charges to Mumbai (I was confirmed the flight timings from Mumbai to Milan only 3 days prior to departure, I went ahead and booked the flights in spite of the prices being high as it was nearing departure). We went through a mental harassment, not being sure of the visa status even if we had to board a flight in a few hours, I wasn’t sure if I need to pack for my trip or wait until Visa confirmation. It is the responsibility of makemytrip to get our visa's beforehand so there is no last minute tension/delay. Our visa was confirmed at 4 30 pm, and we did our last minute packing and rushed to the airport. However, due to the rains and traffic we missed the flight to Mumbai. We looked for alternatives to board another flight to Doha or Milan and realized that our passports were stuck with makemytrip. We then thought of taking a flight to Mumbai to collect the passports next morning and then to Milan. When we spoke to Mr.Mohd Uzef Shaikhand (Head of Operations, Ahmedabad)  that we were ready to bare the extra cost of Rs 70, 000 to get to Milan the same day in Emirates he said that we will have to book a return ticket as well. This kept us wondering as to WHY our return tickets were cancelled when we have already paid for it..your representative assured us that you would arrange to fly the same flight next day..with that we returned home. I got absolutely no updates till 2.10 pm on the 14th August and then I was asked to pay Rs 1, 60, 000 to board a flight from Mumbai to Milan at 10 35 pm or pay Rs 1, 00, 000 and miss two half days of the tour. After all this, we still wished to continue our vacation with you at a future date. We requested  Mr.Mohd Uzef Shaikhand that we are still interested in travelling with makemytrip and were ready to bare a nominal amendment fee for this tour which could be deducted from our booking charges which is Rs 1, 22, 000. But to my surprise here’s  what we were told, Dear Arpita, As informed you in attached email, trust me this is not possible. Please see your departure is already over & payment has been released to our vendor. We are under 100% cancellation and it won’t be possible to refund or adjust any amount. A 100% penalty for cancellation is ridiculous…But hello, I’m not cancelling I’m just amending the tour to a future date….We informed you that we could not board the flight to Mumbai as soon as we got to know. This is day light robbery..!!! After requesting a lot, we were left with a last option to fight this legally, Mr.Mohd Uzef Shaikhand said he would also file a case to rob the rest of the amount we had to pay. Is this how a customer is treated??? What kind of rules are you guys talking about??? Our honeymoon is ruined !! Hoping that other customers are not robbed like we were!! Here is the resolution makemytrip tried to convince us with a few days later ; Looters !! As I had mentioned in my blog, we were ready to bare a nominal amendment fee. I received a call from the head office;Makemytrip. We were asked to bare a penalty of Rs 1, 08, 000 i.e a penalty of Rs 54, 000 per head.The break up that was given to us includes, 1.       Rs 39, 000+ for the flight per head 2.       100$ ( i.e. Rs 5400 ) visa charges 3.       10k for other penalty charges. Please find below the screenshot of charges for a round trip from Mumbai to Milan and Paris to Mumbai through Qatar Airway for normal person to board. So if the airline charges are same if booked directly or through an organizer who has almost daily tours and a tie up with airline companies, why should we book through a tour organizer like makemytrip? Also, makemytrip claims that whooping sum of Rs 39, 000 airline charge per head is non-refundable ??? Rs 10, 000 per head as amendment fee from a company which organizes tours round the year with the same vendor??? And the reason I get is the amount has been released to the vendor? We are not ready to buy a reason like that. I hope makemytrip someday understands what a nominal fee means. I was looking to travel again with the same package but NOT taking that into consideration, this company tries to convince us to take a refund of Rs 6, 500 per head. My hope is that, other customers are not CHEATED and LOOTED by such tour organizers. Esp. if its your honeymoon, you dont want to run around or go through this kind of mental harassment or disturbance. And for us, we are going to continue our fight until we get justice !!",1
2944,"As long as you buy the correct ticket online, things are fine. The troubles start when you need to contact the customer service for any date change, cancellations, or other information. They make you wait like hell for one cancellation. I had to be online for four hours. In 15 minutes, the agent would write two words and transfer to different agents 20 times. The Indian numbers were not working when called. Horrific customer service experience..",1
2945,"One way or other way they will will make you buy the ticket if you call for inquiry. You won't get updated with flight cancellations. You have to be on your own for cancelled flights. You won't get the refund amount (not even 20% of the paid price) at all..... if you want to have a good vacation, don't screw up your time by buying the tickets with makemytrip. No second thought.",1
2946,I recently booked a round international trip and was charged 80 Dollars more than what was on the site. I contacted support and I was promised that amount will be issued back to my bank which never was done. Support don't even respond. I will never want to log on to this site and book tickets.,1
2947,Please don't book your ticket with them. I have booked tickets for my parents and they charged twice. It is more than two weeks and the amount was never credited back. The customer service is the worst that I have ever seen.,1

2949,"Do not ever give your credit card info to make my trip! We booked a hotel for two nights through makemytrip.com. When we arrived at the hotel, we discovered that makemytrip had only booked for 1 night. However, they had charged us for two nights. We can confirm this because the standard hotel charge was only half the amount. We ended up paying the hotel directly for the first night. Later, we called makemytrip, only to hear that they would reply within 72 hours, which they did not. We tried calling again later and nobody answers their phone. It is almost 3 weeks later and the money has not been returned. Makemytrip.com has cheated us out of  Rs. 5500 and they are refusing to give it back. We would STRONGLY recommend that you go somewhere other than makemytrip, as they are not a reliable company.",1
2950,This site is so bogus. They charge your credit / bank account and manage to complete the transaction.. but they never issue the ticket. It has happened to me.. it has happened to my friends which made me believe that it's not a coincidence anymore. Their website's payment gateway SUCKS. I ended up spending hours on the phone chasing down the customer service people and bank folks to get the transaction reversed. Think twice before you even venture into this.....,1
2951,"Make my trip may be good when the going is good but if the slightest glitch happens they simply refuse to help the customer. I unfortunately missed a flight in December 2010 and requested for a refund. Thats where my troubles began. Despite regular reminders on mail (And responses from their side) I am yet to see a single penny in my account. On checking with the airlines, I was informed that they had refunded the amount to the portal within 7 days of the flight and the portal in turn had to pay me. On top of that the customer care mentioned about deducting Penalty, Service Charges (Service?? Are you kidding me?) etc before paying me the amount.  The amount in question is not large but it is about integrity, systems and intentions. Had I made the same booking through the airline website, the taxes and base fare would have been refunded after deducting cancellation charges which amounted to INR 3500. They claimed only INR 181 (Yes, One Hundred eighty one) would be refunded after deducting various charges. On top of that I am yet to see even that payment in my account. I would grossly recommend everyone to buy their tickets directly from Airline websites and definitely not from Makemytrip.com.

Secondly they apply so many hidden conditions on it that even after 10-15 min deep study of it you still cant know basic conditions required by promo code.In my case I was to receive cashback within 15 days but didn't receivE it.When I called customer care after 17  days they told please wait for 1 week more.

My question to them is that if I was not eligible to use this offer isn't its there duty to tell at the time of booking only & why didn't they told me this when I called them first time I have to call them 5-6 time to get to know this.",1
2953,To get to one of their  consultant is a time wasting exercise they are not knowledgeable about half the things.Very poor command on English.Prices higher than direct booking through airlines or hotels. Change of date and cancellation a booking is a nerve racking experience.If the airline charges certain amount they charge double.I sent an email which never got a proper response.I have complained to Amex also to disassociate from them. My sincere advise don't use them !!,1
2954,"I had a very exciting experience just by making online hotel booking through makemytrip.com, which i would like to share with you all. I booked 3 hotel rooms at darjeeling - booking date: sun, 08 jul '12, 00:06 hrs and i got the following message. ""kindly note, your booking is confirmed and you are not required to contact the hotel or makemytrip.com to reconfirm the same."" I called up hotel for some queries on 11 jul '12, 11:00 hrs, and i was informed that they have not received any reservation information from makemytrip. Immediately i logged into my makemytrip account and found my reservation has been bumped to waitlisted status, with the following details. ‘there have been some changes in your existing booking. We apologize for the inconvenience and request you to give us a call at our customer service number 1-800-102-8747 to enquire about latest booking status for your booking’ Note: till now i have not received any communication about this sudden reservation status change from makemytrip through sms / email / phone. I called up makemytrip customer care 10 times, was lucky enough to get through to an agent on 11 jul '12, 11:30 hrs, where they kept he on hold twice (5 minutes waiting time/hold), finally the agent mentioned their was some bla bla bla which she had no clue and i will receive a call within 45 minutes from another agent. I did not receive any call, and i called them again on 11 jul '12, 19:00 hrs, this time the agent also mentioned that my booking will be confirmed and i will get a call within 40 minutes. And you guessed right, i did not receive any call. Then on 12 jul '12, 12:00 hrs, another agent called me for a different purpose, feedback on my customer call experience. After hearing me out; she sounded so concerned and assured me that someone will be engaged to resolve my issue. Alas!! My reservation still stays waitlisted and makemytrip only assures you that they are concerned when you call them up, and asks you this question – “in a scale of 0 to 10, 0 being the lowest, where will you rank makemytrip about your experience and recommend others to avail makemytrip services?” :-) =: horrible memories unlimited :=",1
2955,Customer service people are the dumbest of all. It took 3 days to catch up with them on phone. And online chat they made me wait forever. I would never ever purchase a ticket with make my trip again. I would sincerely suggest never ever try to buy a ticket with makemytrip.com.,1

Their help and guidance can not be described in words. And then the Tour Manager Ms.Sonal Acharaya is such a wonderful person. She is a real asset to the company.

2963,They are a fraud company. They charged 1 lakh rupees for a chardham yatra package for my parents and younger brother and then disappeared.

We went goa for the first time and we did not know what to do. We stayed there. Mind it, the rooms were terrible and no bath tub there. On our return, we spoke to makemytrip and they told they would get back  to us after 7 working days. After 7 days the rep calls and says your claim is denied because you choose an alternative. Are you kidding me ? You expect us to stay along the streets. I would never ever book from them also would never recommend to anyone.

Farhat (Mumbai) who assisted me gave a very good response till the final payment is done. 1) Since I was not aware about the places she mentioned many sightseeing in my package which actually be closed in that season. 2) She also included many itineraries like welcome cake, chocolate bucket etc which was not available when we reached to hotel. They clearly denied since it was not mentioned on vouchers. 3) Hotels were not having any star while she committed/mentioned 3 star hotels in my package. 4) She included Breakfast and dinner in package but on voucher only breakfast was mentioned 5) AC facility in AC deluxe house boat was available only after 8PM in the night. It is very tuff to stay on houseboat without AC/fan due to mosquitoes and humidity. I tried to contact her many times on her mobile/office number/through mail. But no response. I also raised grievance against MakeMyTrip. Grievance number for the same is DTOUR/E/2012/00036. Even after receiving after hard & soft copy from tourism department Mumbai, they dint took it serious.

2969,I have made a booking for Kashmir and I was promised a nice hotel stay and the hotels which were mentioned in the itinerary were all private hotels with the nice ambience. But we were provided with the pathetic hotel in Srinagar specially. It was a government hotel in the outskirts of Srinagar which was almost 15kms away from Srinagar. The food quality of the hotel was very poor. Despite of regular complaints the food quality remained the same. The water was muddy and we were told that its like this only and we cannot help in that. When asked to arrange a car for us so that we can get dinner from outside the make my trip executive refused and we were served maggi as our dinner. Hotel did not even had soft drinks. It was clearly mentioned in our Itinerary that our travel to gulmarg will be from Srinagar and not pahalgam but we were departed to gulmarg from pahalgam because of which we could not see the second phase of gandola ride which is the main place in gulmarg. The hotel staff was very rude and services were very poor.,1

On complaint, the hotel staff accommodated us in one big room for two days. It was very bad experience.there was only one waiter in the hotel who was attending three floors.",1
2971,"Normally, I am not good at writing feedbacks but I thought this one could help a lot of people like me. Here's a feedback on 'Makemytrip's service, especially the travel package department. I found the overall service to be pathetic. I had made a booking to Kashmir 1.5 months in advance and kept asking for travel vouchers. However, they have a process to provide e-tickets and hotel vouchers only 3 days prior to travel date. When I saw the ticket timings, there was an overlap with 2 flights falling at the same time and day. Firstly, its very hard to get the same person as they keep transferring the call from one department to the other. Secondly, nobody takes ownership.. As I am writing this feedback 15 hrs before my travel, I still don't have e-tickets and hotel vouchers with me. On top of this, they wanted me to bear the cost of the hotel stay. Overall, its an utter chaos with holiday packages. If things go smooth, you might not see much hassles. But the Service quality of an organization shows up when things don't go as expected and my experience with makemytrip has been horrendous.. If you ask me, there are other companies like travelbazaar, travelguru etc who provide a better service just because they don't get as many customers as makemytrip gets and they are aiming to go to the next level.. Who knows they might also loot if they become big. Here are some pain-points to look out for from makemytrip: Their telephone connection can get disconnected anytime and you have to repeat the whole story to a new guy everytime If you have booked a holiday package, your call keeps getting transferred to different department like fixed package, post sales, etc etc. You'll receive Travel vouchers only 3 days prior to travel. Pray god that 'everything is in place. While submitting payment details, I get a message that 'error in connection. Please resubmit'.. Eventually, money was deducted twice.. I had to follow up thrice before getting them to refund. They had once booked tickets with different PNR numbers. Unfortunately, the first flight got delayed by 15 mins due to weather issues and the second flight (same airline) left without knowing that a passenger is on another catching flight.. Makemytrip just left me in lurch while I had to fight with airline to provide an alternate booking and they did, but with 3 stops.. I eventually reached Bangalore at 1 AM. Overall, Makemytrip always makes it a point to adhere to their promise - make your experience memorable!!! ---- 6/26 - Back from Vacation. I must say 'Makemytrip' did a good job with planning even though they messed up with ticket booking.. Hotels were good, Vehicle chosen for group booking was good and the places chosen was also quite decent. overall , I had a good experience with the vacation, Thankfully. Some takeaways from the trip: If its a group booking, there are high chances that 'seats are not together'. Carry multiple layers of clothing instead of thick winter clothing Carry an umbrella, especially if you have a kid Shoes should be good and Sunglasses are a must Start the day early, say by 7.45 AM so that you reach by 6 and can relax.. It'll help you for the next day. If you have a multiple flights to reach to your destination, look out for the waiting time.. I was to travel to Bangalore and ended up wasting 5-6 hrs in Delhi airport.. I overlooked this point at the time of booking but you may want to make it clear to the makemytrip guy that 'a long wait is unacceptable. Happy Vacation Folks!! Am back to work now.",3
2972,"The pathetic service started from the day we paid full amount and didn't receive any confirmation for same. There was no receipt or booking voucher on my mail id. Also nobody from MakeMyTrip(MMT) contacted us for same. We had to call call center and go through long waiting time to know the payment confirmation. Then without taking our consent over the flight timing tickets were booked and again no mail confirmation. When we contacted the call center the sales person (Vinit Ext# 3354) just sent us the e-ticket with only flight details. There were no hotel details, neither any cab voucher. Once again we had to fight to get this simple process done which should have been done by MMT. MMT gave us 6:40 AM flight which was not at all convenient to us, as we were travelling from Pune to Mumbai to catch flight. We request MMT for 9:30 AM flight, but no one listened to our requests. We had to fight for our genuine request but got a lame reason that we never confirmed the flight time during trip booking. Such a bad treatment to customers from MMT. Looked like MMT prefer own convenience over the customer's. But as completely entangled in MMT's trap, I had to travel 200 KM in a cab with my wife at 2 AM in night. This left us with no night rest before going for our dream vacation (our second honeymoon). After reaching airport we came to know that our tickets are not together. Airline said its a group tickt and they can't change it. Another sweet blow from MMT where a family don't get to travel together. I can understand the difficulty to arrange consecutive tickets for a family of 6+, but MMT couldn't ensure the same for just TWO people. We had to travel separately for 4 hours on our second honeymoon. Same thing happened during return journey too. What an service from MMT!!! Even after landing at Srinagar airport our ordeal didn't stop. We came to know about unavailability of our already booked 'private cab' is not there. And as we were not provided any confirm hotel or cab voucher, we had nothing to show to local tour manager. He asked us to contact the great service desk of MMT. Once again customer has to sort the problem as if we've created it. We didn't even get any sensitivity from local MMT people neither from service desk. We had to make calls from our roaming cells with so famous long waiting time instead of enjoying our first day in Srinagar. They couldn't solve the problem even after explaining the emergency. As a government agency they asked me to call next day morning as concerned department don't work in evening. It was such an frustrating situation which ruined our first day totally. After paying so much for the services what a poor customer get is sheer FRUSTRATION. Can MMT compensate for all these sufferings ??? Service desk promised to call me back on resolution of my complaint for private cab on day one, but we never got it. So on second day we had to call them again which was terminated abruptly by them. Again nobody bothered to call back us on the status of private cab, so we had to again share the vehicle. This caused so much problem to my wife who suffered from motion sickness due to travelling in a coach through winding hill route to Gulmarg. So this way MMT ruined our second day too. What else we could do than cursing that fateful day when we approached MMT for our trip. In Gulmarg there was no assistance from MMT to arrange tickets for cable ride. Due to heavy rush we missed the only attraction in Gulmarg and had to rest in hotel whole day. Once again pathetic customer management from from MMT!!! The FOOD : The second most vital point of any vacation is the food. People like to have good quality food as they have paid so much to MMT. But as MMT never think about the customer and always for MONEY, we got the cheapest food available in the market. Also it was the same menu throughout the trip. Everybody used to complain poor hotel guys everyday who had no fault in food preparation. In Pahalgam, hotel management put an explicit notice they are not responsible for the complaints for food. This is the great planning by MMT. Once again they proved that they create 'Unlimited Memories'.... good or bad, who cares here??? MMT should change the slogan 'Apana Sapna Money Money"". The customer support : MMT has one of the worst customer support. After getting initial blows from the brainy sale person at MMT, we had to literally struggle to get the cab problem solved. MMT will commit mistake (no private cab, no cab voucher) then they will ask customer to resolve it by calling customer care. When poor customer calls them they can't even call back and keep them on hold for long time as they keep him transferring from department to department. Customer has to beg for resolution as if MMT has organized the trip free of charge and they are doing great charity to him. We also asked for the travel bills (only flight and taxi) for this trip which will help to claim tax benefit. But no MMT representative said it was a group trip, hence they can't provide it. As a customer aren't we entitle for a proper bill of our payments? If its not so difficult then why can't you provide if asked by customer on special request? The refund: As communicated over phone by MMT representative we were about to get the refund. We called MMT customer care once were back and they promised to refund me for 2 days of cab charges onb 6-June-2012. We waited for 5 days and called back again on 11-June-2012 and was surprised to hear that there is no such request in their system. As if MMT has made a god promise that they won't stop making customer experience as hell as possible. Again I'd to explain the scenario and convince them that I'm asking for genuine refund. After a long wait they finally agreed to give back our money, but without tax which they charged while booking. I didn't understand while booking these guys never forget to charge the service tax, but while refund they do very conveniently. After reminding of the service tax, he calculated the refund correctly. That shows if I'd not, I would have not received the actual refund. What is this loot from MMT??? Why customer has to suffer not once but multiple times to get his money back? Why you can't call them and ask for the details required to do so? Why this is so difficult? Don't you have a post-sales department? Don't they gather feedback from customers avoid same mistakes to improve in future? I think asking people to drop mail at feedback mail id is not enough. Please showcase the cases where you've taken action and display it on website. It will improve the credibility of MMT, which seems to be lowering day by day after each trip. We'd a pathetic experience and so did many co-passengers, but MMT never showed a simple courtesy to ask for ground level feedback from client after the trip. As if MMT is not interested in making a long term relationship with customer. If MMT is only focussed on short term benefits which will be quite petty, then its future is very gloomy. If one can't respect the customer then that business can't survive in a tough market like today.",1
2973,"I was booking a ticket to Delhi through them MAKEMYTRIP  Complaint no. 1206r0043447. After entering the payment details, error message was displayed on the screen & I proceeded with booking again. But when I visited my mail box I could see two tickets & now the MAKEMYTRIP is levying the cancellation charges on me for one of the tickets , I have been made to pay because of their fault. Why will a customer book two tickets fro the same person on the same flight for same sector ? Can makemytirp answer this. Guys, don't use their services",1
2974,"I will advice to all that never book a hotel online. They always cheat you. They never deliver what they claim. You will loose your money and time and get punishment to live a place what you never like. The hotels which are not good they always claim that they are good enough and it is for sure if MakeMyTrip is taking responsibility for those hotels, then they should help their customers. But they never help you.",1
2975,"My experience on their holiday package was bad. Right from pre holiday booking information, cancellation of number of days, lack of communication, poor attitude of tour managers, cancellation of itinerary without alternative, wastage of time doing nothing and poor booking of air flights when huge amount of time was spent waiting for kingfisher flights. Don't understand why the entire group was booked in inconvenient kingfisher flights even when the clients were willing to pay for convenience and comfort. In fact the premium tour booked by me had nothing premium about it. Please don't go by the TV advertisement. The tag line memories unlimited means you will have unlimited memories of bad arrangements and feeling foolish throughout the tour. MMT is not capable of handling making any trip memorable.",1
2976,"Horrible experience Poor customer relationship. I booked 6 Airline tickets from New Delhi to Shimla for 6th June 12. I found that cash back offer as compared to cleartrip.com was very less. Booking ID - NF220112000 9821 & Booking ID - NF220352001 2569. Unfortunately, I had to cancel my trip And when I cancelled my tickets the website showed cancellation charges of Rs750/Airline+Rs250/ makemytrip.com. But when I received email from them Amount of Rs 5123/was confirmed against original ticket amount of Rs 6647/each ticket. Total Rs.1524 were deducted against confirmation of Rs.1000/deduction as shown on web page. Moreover Airline confirmed that they give complete refund of infants tickets. I sent one mail to makemytrip people but nobody bothered to contact me. This type of service will certainly go against them. Regards R Kohli",1
2977,"Our group of 16 had a horrible experience with Make My Trip when we went on their Kashmir package from 19th to 25th May 2012. Some of the points on which Make My Trip terribly goofed up are :- 1) Despite booking at the beginning of February we were not provided details of the hotel till 3 days before travel 2)14 of us were booked on JetKonnect and 2 on Indigo. But at the last minute without prior intimation the 2 were issued Kingfisher tickets with long halts in Delhi. The Kingfisher flight from Srinagar was at 4 pm while JetKonnect was at 2 pm yet all were transported together from the hotel at 11am. The Kingfisher passengers were not allowed into the airport and had to wait out for 2 hours. Leaving the hotel at 11 am these two passengers reached Mumbai close to midnight. 3)Was told we would be staying in California houseboats in Srinagar but was put up in a lousy Shikhara 4) Despite confirming that 2 vehicles will be reserved for our group , the tour managers tried to squeeze 2 more passengers in our vehicles which we resisted . After , multiple calls to various people in MMT it got resolved after 90 minutes with all members loosing temper & wasting precious time . Still, the tour guys insisted that some baggage's to be loaded on our vehicles , which caused delay and missing the second phase of Gondola ride in Gulmarg. 5)Four of the 6 rooms booked was meant for 3 adults yet the room offered at Paradise Inn, Pahalgam was so small that an extra bed would not fit in. 6) The food arrangements were extremely poor at all locations . I can't comprehend with this crazy idea of MMT of hiring ""Maharaj"" from Rajasthan to serve us same food, day in day out at all locations . The food without exception at all locations was unhealthy , oily and inedible. At Shikara , in fact the food was uncooked The standard menu was Roti, Dal, Paneer , Chicken , Papad . The Papads were kept in a corrugated box and no hygeine was maintained in the serving area. We were also forced to buy Mineral water at more than MRP at the Dal lake.When we booked we were not informed that we will not be served food from the hotel , as tourists we expected to be served local cuisine at least once. Because of the poor food quality we were forced to eat outside at least on three occasions We tried Paradise restaurant in Pahalgam town for the local cuisine( owned by the same group where we were staying ) and were discussing with the owner of the sub-standard food arrangement at the hotel. He promptly put a disclaimer at the hotel saying that food served is from MMT and not by the hotel. It is clearly found that Make My Trip is not equipped to handle such holidays and people should refrain from using their services.",1
2978,"It was a horrible experience. When makemytrip sends you confirmation mail that your booking has been confirmed via mail and also sends you booking voucher. Then you happily go to the destination, wait for the BUS with your family. You slowly realise that the bus has been cancelled or rather such a bus service never existed. They make stranded in a bus stand for hours together till midnight and then cut a sorry figure that they will give a refund. Their service sucks and causes immense pain to people. Such fraudsters should be pulled to the consumer court.",1
2979,"""Booking confirmed via mail, but no service!"" It was horrible experience. When makemytrip sends you confirmation mail that your booking has been confirmed via mail and also sends you booking voucher. Then you happily go to the destination, lands at airport and looks all over the airport to check if some one is waiting with placard with your name on it. you almost move in and around airport for 20 mins, then calls the given customer support no on the voucher. Then some one(not makemytrip) picks your call and ask for you booking number and when confirmed they say ""no booking with that voucher number"". You call home back, ask your brother to look for makemytrip customer number from their website and finally contact them. After 20 mins on hold with their voice support, they finally say booking is confirmed, but service provider at destination didn't turn up and checks with me if I can wait for another 1hr at the airport so that they can send you another cab. That's my story at Ahmedabad airport when I booked their cab service. really got pissed off with makemytrip. cancelled the order choose the local airport taxi to reach the destinations. Probably, these people got inspired from their own advertisement. when that fellow forgets everything(family, friends, his own kid) but remembers the brand makemytrip. They even forget their customers, their bookings. but just do the branding. horrible company. never book with them.",1

2981,"I have used makemy trip to book bus tickets, train tickets, hotel bookings and of course air bookings. In short most of their offerings. Along with tedbuss, makemy trip was one of the earliest to jump onto the bus ticket wagon. In terms of comparison, it is the same as any other travel site - yatra, cleartrip, ibibo etc. I have not had any problems in booking from their site, so I dont knoww about the customer service. hotels that I have booked have been good and value for money, over all the web interface is simple and user friendly and occasionally, the air fares here are marginaally cheaper. I would recommend makemytrip , but in the same vein as yatra and cleartrip. Makemy trip offers a co branded credit card which I dont use, but which frequent travelers may find useful.",4
2982,"I had made a booking for my flight from mumbai to bangalore from this coming june 2012. My booking was done by inlaws in my surname after my marriage. But I had not yet changed my maiden surname in passport n id proofs. So I called make my trip customer care, firstly I had to call them 3- 4 times then waited for the concern department to ans call took another 10- 15 mins (kept me on hold) After telling them the problem, I requested them to change the name in ticket if possible or help me with some solution. They kept me on hold for more 5 mins then said sorry cant change the name, the only solution is cancel the booking and rebook, I asked them for cancellation charges, they again kept me on hold for 5-10 mins and said 1000rs from each ticket and other one is non refund so whole money will go. This solution bothered me so before cancelling the booking I called the airline to ask what should I do, the told me no need to cancel the ticket, simply get your marriage certificate along with an affadavit that your surname has been change from this to that after marriage. I almost save on 10000Rs which make my trip would earn again for rebooking. They are very badly managed with very poor knowledge",1
2983,"They charge the full amount of your booking, but you'll realize on the day of your travel that no booking was actually made. You'll scramble around to find alternatives, pay a higher rate and then spend hours talking to the make my trip customer support to get a refund. When the refund arrives, it is actually a lesser amount than the initial charged amount. More phone calls later, you get another refund and yet, the refunds never add up to what was charged. It feels like they run a scheme to make money by processing bookings and then giving lesser refunds and hoping you don't have the time or energy to try and get all of your money back. I'm not sure how this company is considered legit and has so many tie ups with banks and co-branded credit cards. It's insane. STAY AWAY",1

Hotel was not ready to provide us with room or a basic facility like cup of tea and said they dont get any money from make my trip so they cannot provide us with all this. After requesting a lot they gave us dirty room where a family checked out 5 mins before. We were treated like a beggars. Instead of making your trip they spoiled our trip. In 4 nights we changed 3 hotels as there was no booking by make my trip inspite of making 100% payment 15 days before check in. Do not book through make my trip. They are fraud and you will feel helpless after paying everything in advance...it was like a nightmare for us !!!!!!",1
2985,"Before I start writing my experience, if some one of you have just logged in to check whether it’s worth going ahead to book Makemytrip’s Himachal Tour, just by seeing one experienced person’s comments and blindly decide to ‘go’ or ‘not to go’, I will say only one thing. ‘Don’t go’, with Makemytrip. People with more patience can continue reading. I booked my vacation to HP thr’ makemytrip, for my family of four, despite going through several bad reviews on various websites including this one. I thought may be those were one off experiences and this may not happen to me. But towards the end it looked like MMT has made up it as their custom to inconvenience all their customers without leaving any one. I will be unfair to say that most of their services could be this way as I’ve tried only HP tour, but looking at the treatment meted out to me, I could guess that MMT is also like one of those numerous ‘faceless’ organizations where everything has to go thr’ procedure and more often than none, professionalism comes outside the set procedures. I don’t want to kill your time by being too much philosophical here and will brief about my bad experiences below. Pls note that words are never enough to explain the trauma one goes through that too on a vacation!! Which we want to have for the very reason of having enough trauma during work days anyway.  1. All the while this executive Rajendra Negi was harping on full payment and I had delayed it purposefully because I was not sure of my trip. Within 10 days, the rates had gone up by 10k (from 75k to 85k) and the reason given was hike in the airfares. I didn’t have any past reference to check what he was saying was true. So without second chance as it was already too late to look for something else, I had to pay full amount of Rs 85k. first suspecion on their operation.  2. I had categorically specified during my chat and phone calls to Rajendra Negi that I needed a sedan car and not a hatch back one. Despite his verbal confirmation to give me an Indigo and not Indica, this person sends me a ca voucher for Indica. I called him again and threatened him that I will escalate this issue then he sends me a ‘modified’ voucher for Indigo which later turned out to be a fake one. On my arrival at Delhi from where we were supposed to leave for Shimla, I found out that I was given a lousy Indica which was stinking, no AC working and almost about to break down. I called up the cab servie people to upgrade me with Indigo and those courteous people (Holiday Himachal) sent me an Indigo with very friendly dirver for 7 days. But later I had to pay Rs 2200 extra for using Indigo as they had received only Indica’s voucher and not Indigo’s. I had contacted Rajendra Negi on the previous day who told me will call me in 2 minutes but NEVER RESPONDED TO MY NUMEROUS CALLS FOR NEXT 7 DAYS!! Such a professional he is.  3. As you can imagine good amount is involved, I insisted that they book 3 star and above hotels for me and my family. I even mentioned that if some extra amount has to be paid only to make sure I get good hotels, I was ready. He confirmed to me that all are 3 star and above category hotels. What I found in Manali, Chandigarh were below standard hotels, forget budget hotels. (Hilltone resorts at Manali, City plaza 7 at Chandigarh) Only exception was hotel at Shimla – Fairmont. It was slightly better than the above. Hilltone Resorts – it was being renovated and the rooms were stinking, puris in breakfast had hair in them, curds was black in color, yuck! Hellish experience there. They didn’t forget to charge us for the heaters used for such chilly nights when it was their duty to provide us with them.  4. I was made to pay service tax in the hotels I had stayed which was never mentioned anywhere in my voucher or hotels’ vouchers. When I called up a faceless executive again, I was lectured on I should have read ‘terms and conditions’ to find out that clause was there. All this while Rajendra Negi had insisted that my trip was ‘all inclusive’  5. I did not even receive an invoice from them. I had to call the toll free number approximately 20 times to get connected and explain them this. Their numbers promptly used to get disconnected when I was right about to hear their response.  6. The feedback section in their website never works.  7. No matter how many times you call, you will always speak to some junior executives and their bosses are never available to escalate any issues. You will be sick and tired of the standard answers they give like ‘we really apologise for the inconvenience caused to you’ and all that blah blah, thus further inconveniencing with such meaningless apologies.  8. If you think you can ‘make your trip’ with MMT, expecting some good star hotels, with your enhanced lifestyle and all, forget it. Sorry to say, this is for the people who have never stayed in hotels before and who have not seen better hotels. I met several customers of MMT during my trip and found none to be satisfied with them.  9. Unfortunately, as said above, I can not write all the bad experiences I had each time I had to call them for the hotels, for the cab vouchers, for invoices etc,  in words. But if you ask me next time would I consider MMT for my vacation? NO!!! Make My Trip – Unlimited moemories – spoiled my trip and gave me unlimited bad memories that I would like to forget. Date of travel – from may 8th till may 15th 2012.",1
2986,They are the worst people I have dealt with. They made the trip hell for my elderly parents who were travelling alone to India. The agent who booked my parents for this trip booked for them separate Internation and Domestic sectors. So when my parents took the connecting flight within India they had to pay Rs.6000/kg as domestic extra baggage fees ( which came out to almost $500 each way) .As some of you may know that travelling international you are allowed 2 bags 50lbs (23kg) each but in domestic they would allow my parents to carry only 1 bag 44lbs  It is the most ridiculous thing I have heard. My parents are american citizens and for them to be able to carry international baggage till India and then pay for the rest was stupid on the part of the airlines. they lost almost $1000 over this fuss. And they had the nerve to blame my parents for this mistake that we did not consider that. And they have the worst customer service I can imagine everyone puts you on hold for almost 30 minutes minimum. I do not recommend them to anyone. If i had anything less than a star i would rate that.,1
2987,I had to travel to India from Toronto for my mothers funeral and booked a flight through  make my trip.com and they really screwed me for economy class fare I spoke to one rep singhbal  and she forced me to get on Air India flight for US$2800 which she charged my  credit card.The fares are in around$1800 at that time. On my return I complained to them and BBB about  fares and their customer service manager response was disgusting with no regard for a customer who has been fleeced with high fares They screw you and  justify saying complaint is false.

2988,Lie like.. hurry! hurr! only 1 ticket left... And for refund and difference in payment works like typical old school... have to call them multiple times to ask for status. Then they move to next step and so the cycle begins.. its been 3 weeks and I've not got my money. You go to travel agent for two things.. not super expensive and peace of mind whatever you got. But if you get burn on both the terms.. well then you decide can you handle this... In short term.. you'll like it.. you'll feel good about makemytrip's service but in long term... well I hope they don't bite you when you actually don't need any.,1
2989,"I have used this site twice or thrice for my overseas trip in the past 2 years and I have found them to be professionally good, atleast a zillion times better than many travel agencies. the good part is their prices are highly comparable to other sites and the official airline sites. Even getting your ticket cancelled and adjusting is just a matter of phone call. Though sometimes the call gets disconnected and getting connected is a head ache and you have to try couple of times. but if u need to book Air India then id suggest to book it online via their official site but for other airlines I trust make my trip. I have used all of their services( cancelling ticket, rescheduling it a day before my flight, booking via site n via phone) and except for connectivity I don have any complaints.",4

2993,"I booked a return ticket from US to India. Each way has three segments. My domentic segment got cancelled and I never know about it till I called the airliner for seat # confirmation! When I called MakeMyTrip, who booked all my tickets, I got NO RESPONSE either on phone or chat. I was turned around for ""I will get right person for you"" in an infinite loop and wait time. One rep named Harpreet Saine, was the worst. Never responded(i waited for 70 min and closed chat). I have to deal with the airliners my self, who always say go back to your agent! If you know what this means. You are on your own, if you get into any trouble due to flight delays /cancellations. This is not what I expect from a booking agent,  This is the first time I used an Indian booking service and may be the last!",1
2994,"I'd been patronising this site for a few months now. Did business worth 30-40K. Let me start with thepositives:  They are very quick to refund any payments because of cancellations. Negatives: 1.  The rates mentioned are often higher than at other sites like agoda or expedia or cleartrip. 2.  They have a scheme where they promote GoAir flights via lowest priced ticket with airline name hidden. Whenever you select this option, the other fares seem to increase suddenly. 3.  This is not a true ONLINE reservation system with hotels(read below). They take bookings and then approach the hotels. Therefore, if you book a hotel here, there is a high chance that they will come back after 5-7 days with a regret mail and a bunch of excuses which are nothing but lies. 4.  The package holiday rates are way too high, unless you choose the hotels they try to push(shown as ""makemytrip recommended"" on their website). Select any other hotel, and the rates are worse than what you will get if you call the hotel directly. Car rates are exhorbitant too. 5.  The hotels that are ""makemytrip recommended"" are usually not very high up on TripAdvisor ratings and these hotels have a nexus with MMT for pushing their higher-grade rooms. My Bad Experiences:  I recently made a trip to Kerala. First thing I found out was that the hotels they pushed were full of negative reviews at TripAdvisor. When I asked for other hotels, the rates seemed very high - and when I called up these other hotels, they were offering 20% lower rates if I stay 2 nights. All this without any attempt to bargain with the hotel! Car rate offered was 50% higher than what I got by googling out an agent in Kerala! I booked my air-tickets for the same trip through MMT, and thankfully this was okay. But for the first night, I wanted a hotel at Kanyakumari and the hotel's online reservation showed that there was no room. I tried the same with MMT.lo & behold! one room was available. I booked it immediately, thinking that MMT may have reserved this in advance. This was on 28th April and they sent me a mail with a confirmation number etc. 7 days later(2 days before my journey), I received a mail from MMT that my booking was not okay and that they would return the money within 3-4 days. Calls to the website were of no help(Call Centre executives with coached responses and no authority to decide). My mails complaining of this were not responded and even threat of going legal fell on deaf ears. I also gave them the option of booking an alternative hotel as this was almost cancelling my trip planned 3 months in advance. Apologies once again- I was asked to use their website, pay again and make a new booking. Finally, I had to skip staying at Kanyakumari as no good rooms were available anywhere. Upon verification, I found that the hotel was full and MMT had confirmed the booking without checking with the hotel. Online Reservation . a bunch of lies! What annoyed me most was the fact that they showed my case as a lost ID - meaning that they received a payment, but could not make out why this was paid and therefore they returned the money. This was explained to me by a call-center supervisor. Bunch of lies. because I paid after logging on from my MMT ID and also received a confirmation from them. There was total silence from MMT in spite of my calling requesting a callback and there was no response to my mails.",1
2995,"I ve been a platinum member of makemytrip. doing all the travel related business with them, inspite of their higher costs. because they were good at service. I had a bad experience with them, which is going on. I had booked delhi bangalore flight with id no NF2204047512444 . I cancelled  ticket as the flight was delayed. still I ve not got any refund. I ve requested them so many time. only answer is I ve to wait. dont know hw long.",1
2996,"I booked THREE business class tickets from india to usa and back. The agent made a mistake' and even though I called within a day I was penalized $1400. The agent Ajay Dhawan promised at least some reparation, but never called back. Makemytrip refused any help. Repeated calls were futile. Horrible experience. Will never use them again. Will never refer anybody. Ended up paying more than most other airlines. This is despite calling several times. This reflects very very badly on India.",1
2997,"I had 2 very bad experience with MakeMyTrip(MMT) hotel booking. (1) I had booked three rooms with MMT in Sri Annapoorna Towers, Madurai. The Booking Id's are NH252001450277, NH252001450289, NH252001450301. On the time of check-in, I got the info from the receptionist says, the payment is not yet credited. So, I called the MMT customer care and asked the reason and they informed me that soon it will be credited. The receptionist asked Rs 6, 000 as advance and she agreed that if the payment is credited before check out then no issues and refund the full amount. Otherwise the rent of Rs 1, 738 per room(totally Rs 5, 214) will be deducted. I agreed for that and did the check-in. Until my check-out there was no payment made. I called the customer care for 16 times, but no proper answer. Finally I was waiting for 7 hours after check-in and left that hotel by making double payment. Again I called the MMT customer care for this issue and till now(9 months over) this issues is not solved. I have attached the rent receipt paid in that hotel. (2) I had booked two rooms with MMT in Hotel Century Residency, Koramangala, Bangalore. The booking id's are NH210431921009 and NH210411921007. I had parked my vehicle in the parking area. The next day I saw my vehicle got damaged by the local drunken guys. I asked that local guy and he hitted me without any reason. I did the complaint to the management but they are not ready to take any action on that guy. Instead of that, the management tried to convince me. I reported the same to MMT, but till now no action taken or no reply. I had spent Rs 4, 500 from my pocket for that vehicle damage. So guys, think twice before making a booking with Make My Trip.",1
2998,"I had booked a hotel and I got a confirmation email. It stated your booking is confirmed and no need to call the hotel or makemytrip. two days later I got a call from makemytrip stating my booking is not confirmed and they will provide a different hotel, during peak season in two days rate were high, was not able to choose and was give a lower grad room and hotel. When I asked to cancel the booking, customer care confirmed that my booking is cancelled and refund will be made within 7 days. it has taken 20 days and no refund. I wrote n number of emails, called to customer care no response and the only response I got was "" supervisor is busy will arrange a call back from concerned department. I never got any call back till date and I think this promise was made by 4 associate till now. It is just a standard script they use just to divert the customers attention. Makemytrip is worst in it customer service I have faced in my life.",1
2999,"I have been using Make my trip.com for my travel needs. Past couple of times I have been having a hard time with them. There are several issues. Hotels are overpriced in the website. I recently traveled to Kanpur. I had my room booked through Make my trip.A hotel assistant said that the rooms cost 999 per day. Though we did not express concern to him we felt cheated. We had to pay 500 rupees more. When I book through Make my trip, I expect to be looking at booking for the best deal. They are taking us for granted and advertising that they give the best deal . But they dont. Hotels are not verified. During the trip. the hotel we booked was under renovation. Why was it open for booking when they were renovating? Does make my trip not verify the hotels before they allow them to be open for booking. When we reached Kanpur, it was already 9 in the night and were shocked to see that they were painting the rooms that the hotel staff gave us. the room was still wet and stinking of paint and still they insist on staying at that room.we. denied and after long argument, they said they have a sister concern and took us to that hotel and that was very very unacceptable. Then to another well we were tired of all the travelling and argument and had to accept the room. well again that was stinky and not maintained as well. but we adjusted. Poor customer service: I called customer service to get a compensation for the trouble(promised by them as a 100% refund if you dont get what you see). I spoke to 4 agents, 1 manager . My entire communication would have lasted for 2 hours of which 1 hour and 50 minutes I was on hold. After all the ordeal, they end up telling me that I have to send a email to a couple of IDs which I did. I received and automated email with a reference number and that they will get back with a solution with in 48 hours. Well still no response. So I call customer service again, they say they have to talk to the hotel before a solution. and then they say that we should not have accepted their offer and should have called Customer service at 10 in the night when they are not able to answer my question and resolve my issue for the past 3 days. Even after all the interaction, no response! So now I am posting this so that lesser people will have to face these kind of issues in the future. I think it will be wiser for us to review the hotels on these websites and book them directly at the hotel. I see that this online travel maker is looting people by advertising wrongly. So beware!",1
3000,"Guys, please be careful in dealing with this completely non-sense company... you can not trust them for their basic job... expecting company to provide you support is a nightmare... I booked me an my family for a weekend trip to the Corbett... we booked a hotel called ""the Den""https://thedencorbett.com/well ahead of our dates of travel, obviously paid in advance and got a confirmed voucher of our booking, which read ""the booking is confirmed and we need not confirm the same with the hotel"". After spending 12 hours on road when we reached the hotel, Mr. Thomas the hotel manager said we have no booking there and moreover they were completely sold off, right at the far end of the jungle, with your family and a small kid along, nothing could have been more frustrating than this. We with no choice in hand called up the given MakeMyTrip Numbers on the confirmation voucher, we were made to go through all possible non-sense at that point, like holding the calls for half an hour, promises to call us back with no response for 20 - 25 minutes... not transferring calls to the floor supervisor, once done, she saying sorry but not showing any serious signs of willingness to help etc. Finally when I was blushing in anger and asked the lady to give me customer services head, I was refused. When I furiously asked to give me the company's CEO's number I was obviously denied. Finally after running between the hotel guys, makemytrip spokespersons for about 1.5 hours... I could manage to get the number of their customer services head Ms. Geeta, she said they are trying to resolve the matter... while I spoke to her and asked her to provide the number of CEO she refused as well. Finally, I managed to arrange the number of Deep Kalra from my industry contacts, who is proud CEO of the company and claims to create ""memories unlimited"". I called him up, he responded on the call and when I shared my helpless situation with him, to my surprise he said, I am on vacation and on my way to Rishikesh, please text me in case it is urgent... surprised... I just told him that I am standing with my family at night right mid of the jungle and their confirmed voucher is not allowing me the entry into the hotel which was booked with 100% advance, weeks ago and he is asking me to send him a text message. I believe in case a company's CEO does not have time for a customer, he is not worth claiming creating customer experience. After two - two and half an hour, I was finally given a room by the hotel on the basis that I will pay them Rs.5, 500 per night as against Rs.3, 300 per night of my original booking via MakeMyTrip and. We had another couple who reached there and went through the same situation and were fighting their battle to get a room there. Learning from the whole episode: Even if you get a confirmed voucher from the travel planner, please do ask for a confirmation from the finally booked hotel... you never know, you will find yourself in a situation like ours and feel so helpless with these companies simply washing off their hands and spoiling your holiday excitement. Last but not the least, request makemytrip team to add ""bitter"" before their tagline which says, unlimited memories please. Shame on employees of makemytrip company who do not even understand the 'C' of 'Customer Service'. One thing that they are good in doing is to write apology e-mails, which they definitely did when I reacted after my return but their CEO marked on that e-mail kept sitting like a deaf and dumb. Unfortunately Indian Corrupted law and order makes these folks flee easily otherwise such incidents should enforce serious implecations to companies like these.  People who are not serious about what they are doing should close down their shops.",1
3001,"They won't even bother to inform flight cancellations and if you find it and ask them, they would say ""sorry for the inconvenience"" and we'll refund the money for that segment and you can buy your own ticket in any other airlines or makemytrip can help you book in another flight. This is ridiculous. There are some representatives like Geeta Arya, she won't even respond to your queries once you buy tickets. When it comes for refund, they just rip you off.",1
3002,"I recently asked for a quotation for my Amarnath trip (3N4D) from Srinagar from MakeMyTrip. I have received very positive response and got a quick quotation with good price. My reference id is 120505-01619. The executive Mr Rajendra Negi asked me to confirm the trip as early as possible as they are offering the best price. When I tried to call him on the same day in 1 hour gap, surprisingly they did not respond. Even I confirmed my travel through email which they provided me in the quotation email. Even they did not bothor to respond to that email. Even I did not get any proper response to my SMS sent to his mobile number. I tried to reach him so many ways, after a lot of struggle, I could able to get in touch with him after 2 days. Of course we can expect the answer from them as usual like ""Sorry sir, that offer is closed as it is for very limited time. So who should get the blame? Though the delay is from their side, they did not bother to arrange any other best price. I do not know what the customer support people are doing? I think the company is giving them salaries just not to respond to emails? Even I send couple of requests to the customer support, but did not get any reply. I do not know how this travel agency got familiar. So friends, do not believe in this travel agency if they offer you best price. I concluded that they will give the good price just for sake of giving.. thats it.. nothing more than that.. But they do not confirm your travel with that best price. Very very bad Make My Trip. Friends, if you do not believe me, just find out my reference id I have provided 120505-01619. You can cross check with any of employees you know in MakeMyTrip.com.. then you will come to a conclusion. BE AWARE of MAKEMYTRIP.COM.",1
3003,This is the last place you want to book your tickets. friends their customer supports sucks big time. they no respect for others tome. Never they answer phone calls. Please never book your tickets in special offer if u r not sure of ur travel dates.

3005,"We used to use https://makemytrip.com some years back. At that time the website was mostly used to compare air ticket rates with our regular provider. Many years down the line I started using websites to plan for my journeys and booking through these websites. On my recent trip to Amritsar, while no worthwhile accommodation to my liking was available on any of the other websites, I took a chance and booked 2 hotel rooms for 2 nights at Hotel Teg Royal in Amritsar. I was apprehensive because of the number of reviews I had read of the website where the accommodation booked through the website was not provided or charged extra or hotels arranged for alternate accommodation since makemytrip did not inform the hotel of the booking. In my case, it was different. Hotel was intimated of our booking and the rooms were ready with extra beds as requested. All taxes were included in the amount as shown on the booking voucher. It was a nice trip with a good hotel and nice and friendly staff. I believe, make my trip has the best collection of associated properties and I personally will not stop using this website for making arrangements for my next trip.",3
3006,Ordered paper ticket for my infant and they charged my credit card immediately but never received my ticket. Whenever I call them they tell me that I will receive some information in 24 -48 hrs. I called them around 8-10 times and also from airport at the time of my flight but never received paper ticket. Needed to buy new ticket for my infant from airport. Called them around another 10 times to refund my money as I never received ticket and they told me that they have forwared my complaint to appropriate deparment. Waited for a month and no response. Finally got tired and file dispute through my credit card company to receive my refund. Worst service ever.,1
3007,I booked a pair of bus ticket as there was no direct flight to my destination. After I flew to the nearest airport that is amd. I called the bus operator n to my surprise he said there waz no booking on my name. I immediately call MMY and the it took a staggering 10 mins jus to talk 2 a customer support guy. After telling him the situation that tells me please call back after 1 hour as there is a technical problem. The bus would have left by then I had to buy extra 2 ticket n till this date 6 months after my horrible experience with these the cheaters still have not refunded my money. wrote multiple mails n called 2 to 3 times. I just forgot it. Its like I've given the money to a beggar. This deep kalra stealing peoples' money. I recommend never to use the site. There are many other online portal.,1
3008,"Like me, Travellers usually vent out their anger when something does not go right. Thats the reason, one sees more negative reviews about any service rather than positive ones. I would lay my 100% money on Make My Trip. Over the years I've tried various other Travel sites, but the quality of Service and Client Satisfaction MMT offers is unbeatable! in April 2015, We booked a Hotel Package in Goa and the hotel botched up our experience. Even though the hotel Golden Palms Colva denied any wrong doing, MMT was pro active in getting to the bottom of the case and solved the post -experience issues with much maturity and to our utmost satisfaction. For last one week we have been booking for our Annual Holiday and after checking Yatra, Goibibo, and few other Hotel booking sites, we came to realize that MMT has the fastest and easiest way to book. They had a technical glitch whilst our flights were being done, and someone pro-actively called up to conclude the booking. Likewise for our Hotels bookings, the Offline team was pro active to book 3 sets of hotels for us. Hats off to the Team of Geeta Eral and Kritika Singh who we have been communicating with from CS, who have gone out of their way to ensure our experience satisfaction. Sincere Thanks to all of the Team at MMT. Thanks and Best Regards Tarun Bhatia",5
3009,"MakeMyTrip is a website that is constructed to cheat millions of people into paying them double of what is actually need, while telling they are the cheapest!. I had a personal experience of booking through MakeMyTrip which I sadly regret. I had booked a Deluxe Suite in a hotel. In the picture shown in this website, you make that it must be some good hotel and the ratings given by the website is its a 4 star hotel. Upon my arrival at the hotel, I realize that it is very much less a hotel. It was some kind of lodging without a lift or any kind of restaurant. My room was on the 3rd floor and since there was no lift or bellboys, I had to walk up the 3 floors myself carrying the luggage. Finally hoping to relax in my room I see  that the deluxe room has just 1 tiny bed. I angrily wrote into MakeMyTrip demanding refund. They replied saying that they would give a Rs 500 discount on my next purchase. Little did I know I was about to be cheated again.  I called them up demanding the Rs 500 discount and they said they have no records of  the need to give me any discount. SO EVEN IN EMERGENCIES, DO NOT BOOK THROUGH MakeMyTrip!",1
3010,"I had to buy a last minute ticket from makemytrip when there was a family emergency. They claimed to have only 1 ticket available and they charged 3 times the price of the ticket. I had no choice at that time but to buy it. Their cancellation policy is the worst of all. They cash in on the sentimental value of the person by jacking up the price and giving false claims. I suggest all the people looking for airline, hotel to avoid this phony website. You are better off buying a ticket online for half the price than go thru their bull s**it with a hole in your pocket.",1

I have made several calls, emails, but to no avail and due them all the travel plans have become chaotic and cant travel now until the end of this month as the fares are too high or no tickets to travel on the chosen dates, which is all due the Make My Trip which would leave unlimited memories for cursing them when ever I think of online booking. Even I have written to the CEO Mr. Deep Kalra, still pending response, when the CEO himself is careless means what about the others in the company?

3013,"Most times travelers (guests) are booking the hotels through some of the websites or travel agencies. Research says that, average occupancy for hotels is about 50-60%. It is fact that, many of the hotels are ready to offer the best price given the business lead real-time. The current problem today is that, hotels do not any direct communication from the travelers – whatever the prices travelers see on the Internet today are not necessarily real-time offers – pretty much fixed price – there is always a disconnect between travelers and hotels in the local cities. No rooms or inventory on the website - everything starts from the consumer interest – traveler posts the requirement about the hotel booking on the system along with star rating preferences, check-in and check-out times and budget - system notifies the traveler request to all the Hotels(based on the star rating) in the same local city - Hotels make offers against the traveler’s request along with the offer expiry times - system picks only the top 5 best offers(by lowest price) - totally real-time and rank order changes based on the offers received by the hotels - traveler takes advantage of the best offer and purchase the same.",1

Makemytrip website is easy to use for booking air and train ticket, as a longtime user of their website, I have noticed that their customer service quality has decreased as they have grown in size.",2

If not, go to a travel agent who has local office. Also remember that MMT charges its own fees for booking and cancellation both.  Plus their customer service folks are entitled to hang your phone!",1

He took all the reservation details again and took the credit card number and said he would charge $1575 for the ticket. Few days later when I checked the credit card statement, I noticed I was charged twice. When I called makemytrip customer support and asked them why I was charged twice, They told me that I made two reservations, which is totally false. They are refusing to accept their mistake and blaming me that I made two reservations for the same flight, same day, same time and same passenger I am still fighting with them to get back my money.

3019,"It was the most frustrating bus journey I ever had. I booked the ticket using makemytrip for the first time and I regret my choice now. I booked a ticket from KPHB, Hyderabad to Guntur over Moonlight travels. The basic detail about the bus operator they provided on the ticket - the mobile number is incorrect and the phone was never connecting with a message -""The number you tried is not reachable"" whenever I call it. I realized it fair early when I called the number on 22March morning(My travel is supposed to start at 21:45 that day. I kept calling that number number of times until noon and then realized that I got to get an alternate number with the help of customer care of makemytrip. I called the Toll free number provided on the ticket and kept on hold after verifying basic details about me and the ticket. After informing that the operator number was not connecting, I was  provided with an alternate mobile number.  I was in midst of my work and was now confident that this would serve my problem. So did not call that new number. Now, it is was 21:00 and I was on the way to reach my boarding point. On the way I called up the new number provided by makemytrip customer care and was only shocked to know that it was some other Operator running buses out of Bangalore but with the same operator name: Moonlight travels. They confirmed me that they dont have any buses boarding from Hyderabad. Amidst confusion and not knowing whom to reach out to, I reached my boarding point. It was getting 21:30 and there were lots of traveller waiting for respective buses at that point. I  checked with few if they are by any chance boarding the same bus but in vain. After few minutes, I thought I would call makemytrip customercare once again but now I got the message that the working hours are closed and an automated system addressed my call which doesnt help my agony. I kept gazing all around for a bus from Moonlight travels. Finally I got trace of one which was rushin away. I ran up to it and told my problem. They told me that their bus did not have any online booked tickets and it should be some other bus of the same service which my ticket belongs to. I pleaded him to give me some or the other contact of Moonlight travels as I was stuck up there without any calls from them and the time was already running out. It was almost 22:00 hrs by then. The driver and assistant were so reluctant by then and were asking me only to get down off the bus as if I were a uninvited guest or a begger. I had no other choice as he was already going far from the boarding point and I had to jump out. Now back in agony, I wanted to go home for the longweeked with a festival on the Friday and these people encashing the requirement had a price of  Rs.550 against the regular price of 280 or 300 per ticket. Time was running out and I was just waiting waiting. no one to contact, no one to enquire  and finally no bus. It was 22:35 by then. When I was just cursing myself to have booked my ticket with such an unreliable Operator, I got a call from some unknown number. I answered it and Thank God it was the bus operator. You know what, he just checked my name and started cursing me for staying back in the boarding point until then and told me that the bus is at SRNagar(this bust stop is almost 10km away from my designated KPHB boarding point) I retarded saying why dint you call me until now if you are already at SR Nagar. He dint want to answer me he told me that they were just waiting for me to board the bus and it would be 00:30 to pull off the bus from there just because of me.  I had no clue what this guy was yelling but one thing on my mind at that point was . I have to catch the bus. I understood am not going to get any valid reply and told him that am taking an auto immediately to reach SR Nagar. That clever auto guy showcasing the traffic and my hurry, squeezed 100 bucks for taking me to SR Nagar. The auto guy anyways was quick enough and took me to SR Nagar by 23:00. I had to call the operator couple of times while trying to trace the exact place where the bus is as that place was new. Now, I reached the bus and I saw something happening in front of it. The police were trying to write a fine for standing the bus there or something of sort. dint know what it was for. Now the bus assistant hurried me into the bus saying we got to start off from there and they have a problem with the Police. I dint even get a chance to talk. I was only happy that I finally am going to home for the festival but by then was lot upset with the way the bus operator dealt with me. the tension and pain in waiting for more than an hour after the designate pick up time, not knowing whom to contact. I couldn't wait anymore, I walked from my seat to the driver cabin and asked him straight why did not you pick me up at KPHB. The driver and assitant started saying that close to 10 people boarded the bus at 21:40. I said I was at the pick up point by 21:30 but could not find the bus and asked him to show who all boarded at KPHB. They then diverted the discussion, saying that I did not call the them. I showed the number given by makemytrip with the invalid mobile number and told him that it was not connecting. Well even if I could not connect them, I was wondering why the hell they can't call me. The only answer both told was that they waiting for me to board the bus in any of the coming stops after my selected boarding point of KPHB. KPHB was the very starting point for the bus as per the information on Makemytrip. Going by common sense, if one books a ticket at a starting point of a bus within a city, it has least chance that he boards somewhere away from that point, because he would most probably be already staying near or behind the very starting point and that could be the reason he chooses that. And it seems they were waiting for me for all the boarding points across 10km from KPHB to SR NAgar. Awesome irresponsible reply. After all this discussion happened, people were still boarding the bus for 30 more minutes in the same point and it started from there by 23:30 hrs. The only conclusion I could draw was the bus did not start from KPHB and they were trying to push the reason over my head that I was not calling them. I was so frustrated to understand that makemytrip is dealing with such irresponsible, un punctual, rude to the customer, reckless bus operator services. Makemytrip.com - I just don't understand how horrible you have been earlier and how many guys like me had a torture just for the reason of choosing you.Having such unreliable bus operators on your list of available buses.shows your negligence to customer care.Do let me know if you need any more information just in-case you want to take some action to stop such incidents from repeating.",1
3020,"Make my Trip made a mistake - they charged the date change fees for travel date change which they charged to our credit card; they forgot to make the date change in their system and now is refusing to refund the money for the original tickets purchased for Rs 13, 068. Email has been written to their CEO an Customer Service Agent but yet to get a response. Please do not deal with this company as their service for cancellations, refunds etc is very very poor. Extremely untrustworthy company.",1
3021,"I tried booking a flight ticket through MakeMyTrip.com yesterday. It was an urgent booking which did not go through but they charged my card against a booking id NF2513317188332....wow...they have the audacity to charge the card, generate the booking ID but say that 'the booking is not confirmed'. The message displayed on the website after the payment page said that 'due to unavailability of seats your tickets cannot be confirmed'. I was zapped to see that the seats and the same fare that I was trying to book was still available even after several hours. Called up customer care but did not get any help...they are horrible, unprofessional people. They said that due to a 'technical error' I was still able to see the particular fare online but the seats were actually not available. I wasted almost 4 hours on phone with them to sort this out....They promised a callback which never came... They are conducting business in a shady and most unprofessional manner...misleading the customers and then not even bothering to assist them. I would not suggest anyone to book through them...Please consider other travel companies and do not ever try MakeMyTrip...You'll just be wasting your time and money....these guys are least bothered...they will NEVER take the pains to go assist the customers...All they are good for is charging the customer's card and extracting money...Once you've paid, you are forgotten...They do not provide any after sales assistance at all :( I guess they have more on their plate than they can chew which has made them unprofessional and highly irresponsible. I wish I could also paste all the screenshots here that I took to prove what a shady company they are....The so called 'special fare' is still very much available online and they are still fooling & harassing countless customers through their 'ever so inefficient website.' If any of you have had a similar bitter experience then do share it with as many people as you can...it might help a lot of them.",1
3022,"I bought two tickets on their website. I decided to pay more to have a refundable ticket. In fact, I bought my tickets on MMT because they were offering a special scheme: 2 RS for cancellation and 251 RS for date change. Unfortunately, I had to cancel my 2 tickets so I called them. They said that they unilaterally cancelled my scheme so they will not only give me back 229 RS! Can you believe it! They were saying that they have the right to do it. What I saw, while surfing on the net is they do this all the time. They always cancel scheme to scam people! Never ever use Make my trip!",1
3023,"I booked a flight through makemytrip.com. I got confirmation email from them, and everything was fine till the day before the travel. For some reason, the ongoing flight was non-operational on that day. I understand that this is beyond makemytrip.com - no issues there. This information(regarding cancellation) was passed on to me by the flight operator, who also told me to contact my travel agent for availing complete refund of the ticket. That is when the problem started. Firstly, it was very difficult to get to talk to a customer care executive. There is no IVR option to talk to a customer care executive, but dialing 9 works when presented with few options. It took me a while to figure this out. Even then, I was put on hold for more than 10 mins, citing that all executives were busy. Assuming that it may get easier to contact them later in the evening, I tried calling them after midnight, but even then, it took almost 25 mins to get to talk to an executive. Eventually, after getting to talk to an executive, he said he did not have the information about the non operational flight, and he just transferred me to another extension which was not attended for 5 mins(the phone just kept ringing for 3-4 mins before getting disconnected). I tried again, and was able to get to an executive in 20 mins. This time, he put the call on hold and after sometime(maybe 3 mins), the call got disconnected. I had to redo the whole exercise again to get to talk to a customer care executive, and eventually was able to get the ticket cancelled(third time lucky!), with complete refund. They have promised that the refund will happen in the next 5 working days. This whole cancellation process took about 90 mins. I had the option to cancel the tickets online, but this was against a cancellation charge, which I was not OK with. I had used makemytrip in the past as well, but never had to cancel my tickets for any reasons. Hence, my experience with them so far had been pretty good - use the website to make the booking and that is it! With the experience I had this time, I feel it is not worth using their services anymore.",1

3025,"I went for a trip to Kerala for 7 days from 27 Feb-4March, 2012 booked via https://makemytrip.com. Booking ID:IN1202B00684 The last day was supposed to be at Allepey houseboat where a JCT 1 bedroom Deluxe A.C houseboat was booked. I had paid Rs 57000 to https://makemytrip.com for the full trip including hotel stay and local transportation. Now since I extended my trip by 1 day after initial booking and above mentioned payment, I was asked to make a direct payment of Rs 6500 to JCT. When I checked in at the houseboat on 2nd March I was surprised that the JCT people have a rule that Deluxe AC houseboat has AC facility for only 9 hrs(9:30 pm to 6:30 am only). It was AC Deluxe houseboat as per my itinerary so I asked for AC at all times for which they asked me for Rs 7000 extra per day. I called https://makemytrip.com stating the problem and asking why it was not communicated to me in the first go that AC Deluxe houseboat has AC facility for only 9 hrs, this is a very crucial thing as it is very hot in kerala in March and we were sweating during the evening without the AC. I decided to check out from the houseboat in the next morning, makemytrip apologized for the inconvenience caused and asked me to make direct payment for the next day for which I decided not to stay.They stated ""that we will check all your communications before booking the trip with our travel agent Jai Sharma, and if we find out this information of limited AC in Deluxe AC houseboat was not communicated to you we would get back in 72 hrs and Rs 6500 which you are paying now for the unused day(3-4th march would be refunded to your account"". They accepted if it is true that there was no communication in this regard it is makemytrip's fault and not JCT houseboat providers and the matter has been escalated for check. I understood they being a market leader in travel services sector are a professionally managed organization and would refund the amount if they are committing they would check the trail calls. Even my local transport was booked via them so I decided to pay as I was sure this thing isn't communicated to me and I would get the refund after trail calls check as committed by their senior travel agent Ms Navneet. It has been more than 12 days and there has been no single communication in this regard. They never escalated the matter after making me pay Rs 6500. I was charged 13000 rs for two days, I stayed for a single night (2nd march 9pm to 3rd march 9 am) and had to check out as it was very hot. They follow fraudelent practices as they do not communicate the details of the hotels and they would commit things to make you shell out money from your pocket with no action on what is committed. I have the call recorded where there travel agent committed necessary action would be taken and the money would be refunded if the travel agent had not communicated such a vital information.",1
3026,"Initial sales was good, got a prompt call from them after my failed attempt to book online. Everything concluded neatly. Then it all began. I was lied to regarding the rescheduling charges. I was told that one change was free, when it turns out its free only if you change before your outbound flight. I was booking a day before my outbound flight, and I specifically asked if I'll be able to change my return flight free of charge and they said'yes'. On top of whatever the airline charges, they charge a service fees. And you don't have an option of going directly to the airline. When I wanted to reschedule: Have to do it through MMT Their IVR takes about 3 minutes before it allows you to speak to a human 8 out of 10 times it disconnects you before that stage(and yes, I had to do this way more than 10 times) When it eventually does put you'in queue' to speak to a human, it took me over 40 minutes each time to actually get to talk to someone. When you call making an international call, you can imagine how many hair strands I pulled in that 40 min. Eventually when a man doing God's work gave me an audience, I had one take away - I had finally met the most unhelpful support staff. I was flexible on dates, was looking for cheapest option to change date, and he couldn't do that for me. Of course, they did a much better job when trying to sell me the tickets in the first place. Summary: I would rather pay an'insurance' premium of buying a little more expensive ticket elsewhere than have to ever deal with them again.",1

3029,"I recently booked a flight ticket from Bangalore to Goa for four adults and one child on MakeMyTrip. Since there was a lot of uncertainty around Kingfisher airlines I thought it better to book on Jetlite. However, upon completing my payment I received a Kingfisher ticket. When I called up the customer service they said that due to a browser problem this has happened and that they will get back to me with the rectified details. However no executive calls back despite repeated requests and assurances to call back. When I called them back after two days and they say that I will have to cancel the booking and will have to bear the cancellation charges. I revolted to this and from that day onward every day a different executive speaks to me and they give me a different explanation and a different cancellation charge. I guess they are just playing around with me. Moreover, When I compare their fares, the airlines themselves are charging a lot less. I would hereby request all to not to trust MakeMyTrip even with one of the most smallest of your travel needs. They are a bunch of irresponsible people sitting out there just to make millions of customer's life miserable.",1
3030,"I am disappointed with the kind of services I received from the vehicle driver and because of his bad attiMr_customtakeouter . I called you and told you to change the driver but this never happened .  we could not cover most of our destinations . he was adamant and telling he is owning 9 cars all attached to Himachal tours . he forced us to listen to his terms, our entire trip has went for a task . following is the painful journey with the bad driver . Day 1-  9-02 we were waiting for the call from driver in the morning 9 am . even Himachal tour people have sent one number which I have dialed multiple time . but no one was picking up that . later on I called you and called himchal tour people . I took the correct number  of the taxi driver and I spoke to him . he was telling their company had given wrong number of main .  by that time it was 11:30 . so we started our tour at 12 pm . because of that I could able to cover only redfort / swamy narayan temple and Kutub minar( at the closing time) . he forcefully took us to something called their company outlet and made us to buy . because of delay from his end we could not cover many places on first day like . india gate . lotus temple . presidents house . and many Day 2 - 10-02 We started our journey from delhi to jaipur at morning 5:15 . but un fortunately we reached jaipur at 12:15. He was driving the vehicle at maximum speed of 60 kms /hr . he was telling its his standard speed . at times he used to cross 70 kms /hr . 7 hours to reach jaipur from delhi is heights of stupidity . in between he gave break at one of his dhaba . which was real stupid . one single  partha of the worst quality costed us 80 rs . after seeing ambar fort he forced us to visit his showroom to purchase . though we were loosing the time he was least bothered .  by 4:45 we could able to cover only two places. he left us near city palace at 4:45 . where as closing time for all the monuments are 5 pm . because of his stupidity we could not see places like, hawa mahal . couple of museums. alberts hill . jantar mantar  etc. finally at 8 .30  pm he left us in the hotel . Though hotel address was simple and easy to find out he made us to sit in the car for more than  1 hour . it was done purposefully . finally I got down from the car and asked the people for the directions . Day 3 - 11- 02 since we wanted to cover most of the places like fathepur and agra We asked him to report at hotel at 8 am .but stupid guy reported at 9:15. I called him more then 5 times to remind him to report early but he said its taking time to get ready. 9:15 we took the car and requested him to show the jantar mantar . but he asked us to pay 60 rs for the parking. After seeing jantar mantar we left jaipur at 11 purposefully he started driving slowly 60 t0 70 kms  . his intentions were clear . at 12:40 he stopped near a hotel and said he would like to take the breakfast . we said we are loosing the time but he said we should take the food in that hotel and its his right to take a break of 1 hour in the after noon . after having lunch he started chatting with some of his friends for more then 10 mints to waste the time . during that time I called Make my trip and take the action . Unfortunately nothing has happened.. in the parking lot we had ugly and bad fight with that guy . later on he started driving little fast . we reached fathepur sikri at 3 pm .   guide over in fathepur sikri said it will take more then 1 hour to reach agra . we can make a choice either fathepur sikri or taj. so without seeing fathepur we left to agra . we reached agra by 4:30 and went inside the taj 5:30. we had literally touch and go situation to buy the tickets . luckly because of a  police officer we had 30 mints of time to see the Taj .  for guide appointed by driver we paid 150 rs. later he took us to some marble showroom . for small taj miniature we paid 500 .   . later we started our journey to Mathur . Driver said mathura temple would be open until 10 pm . we reached mathura by 9:30. but fact was by 8:30 they will lock the mathura temple . even we could not mathura also . Day 4- From our hotel to Airport . He had put all wet blankets in the back seat . All our dress got wet . He was telling since car was dirty he socked the back seats with the water . inspite of all this I paid him tips . So our entire tour went for  a task because of one driver and poor services by make my trip . though I requested you to change the driver first day. Why you did not change him. He was telling he is a owner of that car+ 9 other cars and he enforced his terms and conditions. We missed many of our places during the tour. We hardly got any time to see the places. My question is if you can not keep up your promise then why MMT is doing taxi booking. Why are you relaying on companies like Himchal tours who can not provide quality services .  Do you think this is called services?  I am highly disappointed with your services . I am really planning publish this horrible story in all the sites  so that other travelers like me should not go through the same services from Make my trip I made lot of trips through yatra, I never had this issue but make my trip and holiday Himachal is horrible Guna pc_guna@yahoo.com +9109886288721",1

Both times, the card was charged and later I got an email from makemytrip saying that my booking has been cancelled and my money will be refunded in 7-10 days. When I called them, they said there were no seats on the flight. The first time I thought maybe this was a one time issue and booked over the phone. They charged me more than what the online fare was after I gave them all my debit card info. The second time also they said the cancellation was because there were no seats on the flight (then why the heck do they display it as available online!). But this time I booked on the airline's website directly. Not only were the seats available, but I also got a better price. I wasted more than two hours on makemytrip before I realized they are useless and probably cheating their customers. So my advice - use makemytrip to just find out what flights/schedules are available and then book directly through the airline's website.",1

3038,"Make my trip has only one goal - to sell more tickets and packages. But once it has sold that, it has the worst after sales customer support base. They do not cater well to requests of cancellation or amendments in the ticket. I booked a multicity international ticket for my father in December 2011. Here are some of the problems I faced: After the ticket was booked, Make My Trip(MMT) sent me a mail stating that all tickets were confirmed. However, when I logged on to check my trip.com it showed that one ticket was not confirmed. After many complaints, make my trip finally confirmed the ticket for me. P.S. it was not informed to me by the agency that the ticket was not confirmed. they kept insisting that it was confirmed. Due to some work, my father could not make it to the second flight. so I called up the agency a day before to cancel the ticket. The next day(i.e. day of flight) I get a call saying that cancellation cannot be done. As a last resort, I called up the airlines directly and got it cancelled. Now I am waiting for the refund but MMT is not giving my any update on my refund. I have written two mails to their support staff but it is always set on auto reply and no one has called up/ replied back to know when I would receive the money back. I rescheduled the third flight as the trip got extended. Asking the agency to extend the third flight was like as if I have asked them their life. They kept saying that they cannot amend the ticket and that it should be done directly with the airlines. If they are my travel agents, why should I call up the airlines. It is their job to do that. They kept saying that there is nothing they can do. The executives are very unprofessional and untrained. Instead of helping out the customer, they choose to sit in the cafeteria for one hour saying we are working on your request and then call back saying sorry we cant do anything. Their helpline numbers are not integrated. they keep bouncing you off from one number to another. Every time you give them the same details and every time they will give you only another number to call on. I think with make my trip this proverb goes right - ""naam bade aur darshan chotte"" It was a painful experience booking ticket with them and I am still waiting for my refund. Given a choice, I would never never book with this agency again. They feel once they have sold the ticket, they have achieved their targets and helping that customer in need will take their time off from selling more tickets.",1

He sent us the relevant voucher. The relevant booking was for the second part of our stay in goa. When we reached the hotel after travelling 50 kms we were told that there was no booking for us. only the extended period was booked. We spent the entire day looking for the right hotel.

I recently booked a rail ticket on feb 13 2012 but it said ticket could not be booked so I got my refund back once. I booked the ticket again and this time my status is still showing under process dated 23rd feb 2012  so I decided to call up the call center for help . I only have used service online but never spoke to a rep for assistance so thought of calling I got a rep named jeetender who told me he is checking my status for refund for my rail ticket.after eight mins jeetender ask me a question sir r u calling for your deal code. I asked him dude for the last eight mins what were u helping me with. I  got upset I asked if I could speak to a supervisor or manager he put me on hold and never returned back  the call got disconnected after 21 mins on holding the line that's not the end of the story  I thought of calling back this time I got a l guy named manpreet I asked him I wanted to complain against the previous rep he says my manager  is busy on the other line so he asked me for my booking id which I was giving him but that guy on purpose disconnected my call. I was a very very happy customer with make my trip for so many years but today on the interaction I had with the reps I believe I do not want to show my loyalty to you guys. I don't want my refund keep it as a gift from me to you but today u have lost a customer and you will lose many more who would be reading this website things you need to learn train your reps in the call center even if they don't speak proper English its fine but teach them manners. Do you know how difficult it is to get connected to rail team in make my trip but your reps just disconnect the lines this happened tome thrice today but I don't remember the ma, es of the reps so I did not mention .itook the step of writing this feed back as I have nearly spent one hour forty six mins and thirty seconds to resolve the issue. Thanks for the online service you gave me for years but no thanks for the pathetic customer service u gave me today. Regards, Andrew Dsouza",1
3041,"We booked domestic tickets via this website (NF2201814936167). We had to change the dates on the travel. Unfortunately, there is not way to do this either on their website or via chat. the only way to do that is via phone and I was placed on hold for over 90 minutes. They give you the usual BS about call volume is high etc. but they don't seem to have that issue if you have to make a new reservation (go figure that!). One more issue to watch out for - We booked a fully refundable ticket and I have written confirmation on that and yet when I called them to cancel or change this. the agent told me that they cannot do this.while we explore our options of getting our money back. Please be very careful and if possible avoid this website.",1
3042,"Very poor customer service. I made a domestic reservation(NF2201814936167) and all I wanted to do was change the date . It is such an ordeal. Phone call 1 - after being on hold for 45 minutes was told that I could not do it . note I had a fully refundable fare. When I challenged the customer rep . they disconnected the phone Chat session - tried accessing them via chat spent another 45 minutes and was told by the chat agent that the only way to handle changes to existing travel is to call . so back to square1. I spoke to two chat agents Kushal Rehlan who transferred me to Alok Mullick. Phone call 2 - was on hold for another hour or so and when I got the agent (Nipika Sharma) she initially told me that she cannot help and that she has to transfer me to someone else. at this point I think this is a game they play because upfront the voice prompt asks you to press #2 to speak to an agent regarding changes to existing travel. How come you get to an agent who has no idea how to assist even when you follow the prompts properly? I refused to be transferred and told her to conference me with the right agent. now the new excuse that I got was she has no way of accessing my reservation . I continued to insist on escalating this. She put me on hold for 5 minutes and then told me she was going to hang up and ask somebody else to call me . this reminded me of phone call 1 above(customer support wanting to run away!) . I refused and gave her my cell phone and told her that she could not drop untill I got a call on my other line. now she was out of excuses. short of hanging up she had no way but to resolve this . Its been over 2.5 hours now and I am still on the phone. The latest excuse I get is that their system is slow . Hmm what a day . Is it reasonable to spend hours on the phone just to get the dates changed even when I am willing to pay the fare difference, change fees etc? Readers . PLEASE learn from this experience and AVOID makemytrip.com at all costs.",1
3043,"This is Mandar from Pune in end of January I traveled to Bangkok in customized tour. My anniversary was ruined like anything. They gave me hotel in name of four star which was like a ""lodge"". No direct numbers to reach these guys from Bangkok.I have to make calls of 3000INR to reach these people. After coming to Pune, they didn't even took pains to check with us. Overall extremely bad after service and unaware of the word ""Guest"" which they use so often.. All HONEYMOONERS and couples avoid this if you want to have even decent holiday.",1
3044,Expensive improper service fake promises very false statements that would keep you frustrated. I would recommend not to be part of this firm at all. Also I would suggest no one to ever travel from this travel agency because as I traveled within India and faced one of the worst experiences and thank god I did not travel with them elsewhere. I would rate them minus 5 stars MakeMyTrip should change their name to make my trip worst. DO NOT TRAVEL FROM MAKE MY TRIP Also find more details here: https://consumercourtforum.in/f5/makemytrip-com-cheat-case-60379,1
3045,"The rescheduling charges are quite high as $400 per travel. The worst I have seen. If you go by other sites you may be able to even $100 per travel. Service while ticket booking was nice and once you booked, and service after the ticket booking is worst I ever seen. I send the all the details like Name, Passport details etc. all through mail and they mistyped the DOB. I called 2 times as of now and still DOB is entered as wrong when I am checking my itinerary online.",1
3046,I made a bus booking got a confirmation slip. It was for my parents who rushed from the airport to make it on time to the bus .but found that make my trip had not made any booking and when I called their customer care they gave me some lame excuse about server down .all bullshit had I asked for a new booking everything would work fine. Luckily my parents got the last two seats by again paying for them. After multiple emails n calls they still did not refund my cash. never use them for anything. Other sites for so much better (not gonna name them or else my review will seem bias),1
3047,"Booked tickets on Nov 15 for a hotel from 26th-30th Jan and 26th, I go to the hotel and find my booking is not confirmed. They gave me a replacement and when I try calling to get a refund of 10, 000 which was the difference amount, the response is so bad, they make me wait for 10-15 mins on hold and hang up or say we'll get back but they never do. So attentive when taking money from you and really rude to give it back. I]m still trying to get a call through them. I'm so damn frustrated.",1
3048,"I booked tickets from makemytrip and gave them the dates for which I wanted to purchase my flight tickets for. I mentioned to them that my dates are not flexible at all. The agent helped me out with finding various flight options for various dates and eventually I agreed onto one itinerary. At the end while reconfirming the agent gave me an itinerary with a wrong departure date that was never spoken of during the entire call. I heard the entire call that was traced by them along with the supervisor but even after hearing that the incorrect date was never mentioned by either the agent or me in the entire call, she feels that its not agents fault. I called them at least 4-5 times throughout this entire process with each call around 30 minutes to an hour. Their customer service is the worst among what I have seen. They told me 3 times that the supervisor will call me back, but that call never happened even though I called them at least 2-3 times to make that happen. Finally, when it happened, the supervisor was just not receptive and in spite of having the facts in front of her did not accept that it was their mistake.",1
3049,"I was promised a cashback by Makemytrip staff for purchasing international sector tickets using American Express card. This cashback was supposed to have happened in Nov 2011, that is, within 7 days of booking the ticket. The booking ID was IN1111B05260. Even after repeated follow ups over phone and email, it is still pending as of date and the staff are least helpful. I booked another international ticket and paid through HDFC card on 14-Jan-12. The cashback promised was 4% within 7 days. Unfortunately, this cashback has also not taken place and the staff are least helpful in this regard, even though I have the ""Royale"" membership status on Makemytrip, which I think is another farce. There is no one to whom you can escalate your complaint ! I would never purchase any tickets from this website again and advise others to stay away from Makemytrip.",1
3050,"Why do we book our tickets through an agent? To get good deals and to let us know if anything goes wrong with our flight. They tell you less prices and charge you more expensive trips. They don't let you know if any of your connecting flights are canceled and they reebook the same flight costing you more later... they made me pay more 400$..The customer service people are irritating, they can't answer your questions properly and they won't let you talk to there supervisor if anything goes wrong.. Never ever book your trips on this site.. I used to call the customer service so often and never got a good service.. I always had to see literally each and every day that my flight isn't canceled.. they don't let you be sure of any thing.. they just make money.. I won't even rate a single star to this service..

I was in great problem with my wife and child in a cold night in unknown place. When I contacted to make my trip then answered below: Greetings from Makemytrip! At the outset, we apologize for the inconvenience caused. With reference to your mail, we would like to inform you that the bus operator reserves the right to change the seat number(s) of the passenger(s). The departure and arrival timings mentioned on the e-ticket are only tentative timings. The same are subject to change.

Makemytrip conveyed the change in timings of the ""to"" flight, but did NOT inform me about the change in timings of the return flight. It was a nightmare after reaching Goa airport to know that the flight had already left. Luckily for us, the airline(AI) staff were helpful and got us onto another flight but only after us spending a harrowing 2 hours at the airport. Will never again book through makemytrip.com. The airline staff also told us that this was a common occurrence with makemytrip customers and that they get customers like us every now and then, those who have missed flights because of makemytrip's unprofessionalism.",1
3053,"I am a frequent flyer through Makemytrip and with the same comfortable experience, I had a very recent Holiday package booking through make my trip, though it is slightly expensive than it's competitors. I am fully disappointed with their service and poor back-end team knowledge, support and post sale service. It's a lousy package. I found it booking myself by landing to those destinations, would have a better experience than this. Very Poor hotel services, still expensive. Once you pay you are stuck with this poor service. More over you will be surprised to note that, they do not have any invoice generation facility other than your credit card transaction receipt over the mail for you to submit to LTA. My terrible experience is that, they failed to complete the package as per the plan because of the weather conditions, but they treat that as a cancellation request from the customer and pay zero amount as refund.",1
3054,"MakemyTip lures customer with discounted flights in which it discloses the airline your return ticket is booked on only after payment. However, on your return date it would send you a false message that the relevant Airline has cancelled the flight. Exactly this happened to me and my companion on 17th of January 2012. We were booked on GOA-Bangalore flight G8 - 706  leaving Goa at 22:00 but received  SMS and Email from Makemytrip that our flight has been cancelled. When I contacted Makemytrip they just wanted to refund me the discounted price and would not help any further. When I asked whether they could confirm the cancellation of the flight Makemytrip said it did not have any information on that. Funny isn't it? How can then they send information that flight has been cancelled. Here is some murky business going on. Upon my complaint they said it was a technical glitch. Try to believe them!!!

Then only I realized that the tickets are actually non-refundable(I confirmed from Airline also) but makemytrip gave me wrong information while booking.

They said that they have processed it on 10th Jan I waited and then again called on 16th then they said we have not processed the refund as there were bank holidays on 13th 14th and 15th. will process in next 72 hours.

I did not receive any mails till 5 pm even after following up heavily with makemytrip. Then I asked makemytrip whether I have at least the ticket confirmed, so that I can check with Jetairways. They said I can talk to Jetairways once I reach airport. I called Jetairways they said nothing is booked for my name. I was shocked. I asked them whether tickets are available, they said its available. SO I went and cancelled the ticket and booked thru jetwairways. Anyways same cost the ticket was. Note: my flight is in 10.30 pm and makemytrip never responded even after I said I need to travel to airport which will take nearly 2 hrs from my place. They made me frustrated heavily. Next another issue regarding payments. They took the money for 3 tickets, after cancelling they need to refund. they refunded also the next day. I was happy that at least they refunded on time. But suddenly today they debited 9000 from my account. I don't know whether and what for this is deducted. I am still fighting for my amount. Please note this is for every on who reads this.

They sent me the itinerary which had Return airfare Hotel Gala Christmas dinner Issue no 1: Makemytrip means convenience, they should book tickets to improve the convenience of travel. First they booked a hotel which has checkout at 11.00 am in the morning and flight at 10 pm at night. We were kicked out of the hotel in the morning to roam around for 10 hours. Issue No 2: In the itinerary they took money for Gala Dinner, but it was not given. I later contacted them for refund. At that time they tell the charge was extra for that. REAL LOOTERS and no proper communicate. Basically no transparency. When I called them later, they don't respect your concerns. They simply keep on repeating it was not like this. I just want people to be aware of such issues and it could happen from any travel sites. After all it's our hard earned money.",3

Next day, the agent said it is not possible to assign seat numbers since airline assigns seats only two days before scheduled flight. I decided to cancel tickets. MakeMyTrip charged $500 for some weird cancellation charges. The agent had misguided me about seat assignment, else I would have never gone ahead with the booking in the first place. Horrible travel agents. It's Jan 07 today (1.5 months) and have not received refund as yet. They keep on asking to send some stupid scans of credit card, and then tell me that refund cannot be done to the credit card (again for some weird reason). Am convinced that this a rouge company.

Then, I called the customer care after landing at the hotel but it was of no use...my vacation got wasted.. I recommend to everyone to think hundred times before booking a ticket here. They shouldn't be so unprofessional. They book our tickets so quickly. And ya, very poor customer service, they keep on hold for long and then disconnect the phone...they will give you one standard reason..that is we are trying to connect with the airlines...

3063,"Hi All, This is Ajay from Bangalore Recently (Dec 16) I went to Mauritius for 1 week package which was not costly as compared to Yaatra & other tours and travel because of year end and Christmas. I booked the package in Jaynagar Branch Bangalore initially I booked 3 star hotel but later found that food will be good only in 4 or 5 star hotels in Mauritius so then I changed it to  Le-Meridian hotel. When we reached Mauritius we were welcomed by contact person as mentioned by makemytrip (I was keeping my fingers crossed that time) and we were escorted to hotel from the airport in an A/C Bus which was very clean and good. As per the package 3 days I had nice site seeing and visited lot of good places in Mauritius everything was well organized I was very surprised to see that! But I would like to inform you all that when you choose optional package from the same tourist then you better check with some other options because I found they will charge you more than any one. I also later found that in our hotel itself there were some tourist package which were less expensive than these guys !

3065,"Writing this blog to reiterate my experience and trauma with the most appalling services of self -proclaimed leading online travel portalmakemytrip.com This is how it happened: After two or three days of constant researching for the best flight rates for my round-trip to Goa in the first week of Jan 2012 I finally planned my travel and decided to book my tickets online through credit card. Although the details they required for flights weren't very complicated paying online through credit/ or debit card is one of the worst ordeals I ever encountered. From a one time password, to your internet banking password, to your ccv number etc etc and a zillion more verification details accurately, I finally clicked on the make payment details. Please note that my internet speed was 256 kbps and I entered all the prequisite details very accurately. And what happened next... I get a notification screen and message reading your transaction has been processes however your booking was not confirmed. Which meant that I had forfeitedRs. 5900from my credit card and the booking did not get confirmed. They stated the reason for decline - ==This is a rear occurrence and can happen where there is a sudden drop in seat availability on your chosen flight or fluctuation in connectivity with the airline reservation system. And it would take two working days for the entire amount to be refunded. ==I mean HELLO? What if that were the only funds I had in my account and it were an emergency. And trust me this is the second time it is happening with me through Makemytrip.com. Last year around the same time when I made my booking for a single trip to Goa and the same was declined. The money got deducted from my debit card and the ticket did not get confirmed at all. The refund takes 14 days to credit your account whilst make my trip claims it takes as less as 2 business days which is misguiding again! I recommend that anyone who plans to use makemytrip.com for planning their journey do so at your own risk. The website and services are highly unprofessional and unethical. I am attaching a snap shot of the error message for your reference. This is happened to me twice and Im confident the same must be happening to a million customers nationally and internationally. Instead shell out another 500 INR and get your ticket booked from an ordinary travel agent and I can assure you that you'd be more satisfied with the latter.",1

3068,"The summary of the pathetic experience: I paid to makemytrip for hotel booking in 20 days advance and when I reach to hotel I find no booking for me. After a big battle I get stay for 1 night and I am forced to leave hotel and sit in my cab the next day. No support from makemytrip. just false assurances.not even a callback. A recommendation to all readers: You may get or may have got a good experience(I also had some in past with flight booking) with makemytrip if everything goes fine but take my words, if anything goes wrong you are gone.you will cry and cry and regret. For the complete details please read below as I have given every pinpoint details and I challenge makemytrip to be answerable to these facts. I made a big mistake by booking my first marriage anniversary trip to Munnar ""through makemytrip.com"". I booked flight for me and my wife to Kochi from Chennai and booked a room for 2 nights(Dec 8 and 9 2011) in hotel Grand Plaza munnar. All payments done perfectly and I got the trip ID(NP2514613034178) on Nov 20th. I travelled to kochi fine on 7th and stayed in houseboat in kumarakom and then reached Munnar on Dec 8th around 4:45 PM. I showed the voucher print to the hotel people and they requested me to contact makemytrip because they did not have any booking done by makemytrip in their hotel for this trip id in spite of me booking the hotle 18 days in advance. I was shocked. I called the customer care(which is a pain as it connects to someone after min 5-10 minutes punching of different options and hold time) and they asked me to wait for 10-15 minutes as they will speak to the hotel and call me back. The worst part for me was that the hotel did not have any room empty for that day, else I would have taken one myself. The same was true for other good hotels too as it is the season time. I waited for half an hour and did not get any call back. Meanwhile the hotel people informed me that one cancellation is undergoing by some customer but that is for 1 day. I called up again to makemytrip and I spoke to Priyanka. Again the same story! They said they will call me back. Meanwhile 1 room got cancelled. This all was happening when I was almost shivering because of the cold. No callback. I called them again and spoke to ms Ruby and they asked me to stay for 1 day in the same hotel and they will arrange some other hotel for tomorrow. This pissed me off as I was going for a sight seeing in early morning and I had no charm to checkout from this hotel and wait till 12:00 tomorrow to checkin in other hotel. I requested them to look for some other hotel and confirm my booking for 2 days so that I can spend some time in mental peace. You can imagine the kind of embarrassment I was facing in front of my wife. All this continued till  6:15 PM(1.5 hrs) and I called up again and spoke to Mr Justin Thomas and requested to transfer the call to their supervisor. I waited on hold for another 15 minutes and found no success. Finally due to the cold and embarrassment I decided to checkin for 1 night and left tomorrow on luck. However the room that got cancelled was a suite and I felt relaxed after checkin in it. Meanwhile the superviseor(I think Mr Nikhil) called to the hotel and spoke to me ensuring that I will get the confirmation for next day either in the same hotel or another hotel with higher category by tomorrow early morning. I waited till 09:30 AM next morning(and spoiling my sight seeing) and got no call. Then I started calling again and again. They said me to wait for 15-20 minutes and they will return back with the hotel confirmation. Meanwhile I had to checkout from the hotel before 11:00. No call from makemytrip. Finally I had to checkout from the hotel. I had nowhere to go for the moment and I went and sat into my cab with all my luggage in it. You can imagine the feeling I had at that point. I called up a few more good hotels but all were full. Beeing too tensed and feeling cheated I had no option but to be in the cab. I spoke to Hotel people(Mr Balaji) and requested them a call back in case any cancellation happens. Meanwhile I called up makemytrip which was giving excuses to wait 15-20 minutes since 9:30 AM and now 11:30 AM. I left all hopes and started for a sightseeing with all my luggage with me and the nightmare of getting a good enough hotel in night when I come back. Nobody was caring for me who had paid money in 20 days advance and was forced to checkout of the hotel and sit in the cab. Around afternoon I got a call from Mr Balaji of Grand Plaza that they had got 1 cancellation and will provide me the room. They contacted makemytrip and got approval for the same. It was a little pleasant feeling but at the cost of full day tension, insult instead of relaxing in Munnar. Overall it was a pathetic trip for me after spending around 50000 rupees. And for you Makemytrip, if you happen to read this post. I have contacted my Lawyer today and I have an appointment tomorrow. I am going to take you to the court for the cheating you did to me. Every moment of that day fills me with anger and a zeal to teach you guys a lesson for spoiling someone's trip and cheating with them.",1

Call after one hour. So I  made second booking from Mumbai to New Delhi Go airways 1720 hrs  flight.then I dialed Go airways call center number and cancelled my  ticket which was booked on website of makemytrip. I am again informing  this is  all cheating business with customer. When Go airways taking 750 Rs for  cancellation why on your website it is showing 1750. For a single  ticket?  I am not going to pay any cancellation charges to make my trip.  Because It is purely a website on line booking program mistake /cheating  from this agency. I have all witnesses and evidence against your  agency. I will definetly give this in leading News papers. Transfer my all payment immediately to my account without  taking any cancellation charges of Makemytrip and Go airways. NOTE:- This  agency has not still refunded my amount and not even having  courtesy to contact me. This will be useful for me to have a strong  proof against them . I will publish a detail print of website where transaction has been  taken place.",1
3070,"Had really worse experience with  Flight and Hotel booking. I have made a booking for my  friend, but for some reason he had to change his booking. Okay here we  go, called the MMT help desk and the woman  who took the call told that yeah it is doable and she took like 15  minutes to check the price and penalties. Here she came back and told, I  have to pay 4500 INR , and she asked me to pay it through their website, which is horrible interface. Anyway I made the payment and she promised that I will get the E-ticket with in next 6 hours.  Alright much awaited 6 hours, nothing happened called again, now the  gentleman answered the call told that she made some mistake in the  calculation and that is why the ticket is not issued. And he asked me to  pay another 800 INR,  alright paid again after 5-6 tries on their website.  Another promise  now wait for another 6 hours and you get the ticket. I asked him clearly  ""Can he make sure i don't  have to pay anything more"" His reply was "" I am 100% sure, you will get  the ticket"" . I wait another 6 hours. As expected nothing happened. Called again, and again - 3 times. Every time the person answered the  called replied ""Everything is ok , you get the ticket"" . I wait again  for another  day. Noting happened. Called again, now I got really surprised with his answer ""Why did not you pay the penalty, you haven't paid the penalty and your ticket is not confirmed? What should i say? He asked me to pay another 2500 INR  to get the ticket . I was really shocked and my blood pressure  raised. And the departure time is 20 hours ahead. I called Air India, they responded the ticket is not issued since the penalty is not paid. Called MMT again, and ask they said i Paid 2500 INR.  They put me on hold for more than an hour . And ended up with another promise, I will get the ticket within next one hour. Anyway I got the  E-Ticket after 2-3 hours. Most of the time they had to put me on hold  for long and with an apology message "" sorry our system is slow"" Total time spend on International call : 4 Hours Approx. Here comes the hotel booking I made, everything got confirmed as per MMT, and Just called the hotel for arranging a taxi pick up. Now the story starts, hotel said "" They don't have any booking with this name"". After again so many phone calls to the hotel and MMT. The Hotel arranged room in some other Hotel that they own. OMG. At the end, I got a customer survey email from MMT asking ""How was your stay at hotel?",1
3071,"Last week I booked a holiday package to Malaysia & Singapore thru MMT. After that I just thought of reading reviews about MMT and now I am really Scared !!! Not sure how my trip will be !!! If I would have read these reviews 10 days back, I would have really thought 100 times before booking. Not sure what I can do now since ihave paid the amount. I will cross my finger and hope everything will be alright !!!",1
3072,"I've been having a nightmarish time with Make my trip and would recommend people to AVOID IT. I had used them to book international flights from Delhi to London more than a year ago. Later, I cancelled that flight and booked another carrier departing the same time and date. At that time, I had to use their phone support, since for some reason I was just unable to cancel my flight online. I didn think much about it, but now am facing the brunt of it - their phone support staff did not bother to send me a confirmation. Every time I called I would get a different representative who would'look into it' and ultimately do nothing. Its been over a year now and I am still awaiting my refund. On top of which I just received a random mail saying the company has no records of my cancellation and I need to provide more paperwork. Its terrible service. Since then, I have been trying to reach them - am unable to contact them via phone - havent gotten replies via mails and while their local office seemed completely clueless and unequipped to deal with any issue and prefer beating round the bush. This has been a horrible experience for me. As a frequent flyer - this has been the first and the last time I used this service.",1
3073,"I had to cancel a trip i had booked. There was no clear indication of cancellation charges while buying except for rs 500 per passenger from makemytrip. In my case, the airline charged an additional 20% of the ticket cost that i came to know when i had to cancel!! Buyer beware! Worse, the service representative from makemytrip was unfriendly and argumentative. This is what happens when you lure bare college pass outs(?) Into call centers. Can be a lot more professional.",1
3074,"Awful Experience. In short, the password I set did not get accepted for onward booking. Tried with another account, this time too, for onward booking the password would not work. Wrote to them, and the screen prompt said, the password details had been sent to our email account. They were not. Checked spam too. Complained, no response yet. Called them up, and the automated system gives various options- for rail booking, air booking, hotel bookings and ""others"". When you press others, it leads to a dead end. Tried this many times. Could not get through to anyone over phone. So, I called up the Mumbai office and pressed (not the 'other' option but) the ""Long holiday"" option so I could atleast get a customer service representative. As luck would have it, I was connected to Anushree (Mahim, Mumbai) who talked with such impatience and impertinence when I told her that "" I am sorry I had to connect to this option, since I am not able to get through to anyone. I do not want to book over phone and had called to get help over my account. Can you tell me how to get in touch with someone for administrative issues"". The woman would not listen or let me air my problem. Presumptuously she kept interrupting every half sentence, jumping to conclusions about what I want- air ticket or hotel ticket? she asked continuously. Even if she could not help, as a customer service rep you need to hear out the customer and direct them to the concerned authorities. Then she super sweetly told me to be on hold, put me on music for 3 seconds and disconnected me! Hows that!",2
3075,"Booked through the website, was showing a cheaper price. Then they charged my cc and then said that part of the booking didn't go through and someone will contact with in 6 hrs. No one did. I called them for 3 days no progress, then they keep cutting me or putting me in long hold. Terrible service, totally frustrated now I am thinking of cancelling charge through my credit card company. Avoid them at any cost.",1
3076,"I am using makemytrip.com from last more then 2yrs. And I didn't find any issue. I think makemytrip.com is really doing a great job in this travel business. I have purchased many flight/train tickets in last 2 yrs, but recently I have purchased the flight+hotel for my honeymoon at ooty. Initially I was really afraid as honeymoon is the event which comes once in lifetime. And if you didn't find cool & comfort travel then the honeymoon may become bitter moon with the new girl of your life. So, after long search & study I planned to book the honeymoon trip to ooty through makemytrip.com only. I never visited ooty so also scared of the destination & hotel. I finalized the flight+hotel for a week trip. And really guys the trip was very good. The resort was same & best as I have seen on makemytrip.com. I should say makemytrip.com made my travel comfortable & memorable. I really recommend this website for travel. Milind D Gr Noida",5
3077,"I came across a good advertised offer by MakeMyTrip to get a cashback on airtravel tickets on MakeMyTrip.com. The firm had offered a cash back for a certain amount on tickets once the travel is completed. So, I had booked 4 tickets on its website under the Booking IDs: NF2525310671307, NF2525310671173, NF2525310671053 and NF2525310670717. However, I did not receive any cash back from the company after completion of travel. Thereafter, I called up at all available contact numbers of the company but no contact number had any help desk support. All numbers lead to just automated information. Moreover, I have written tons of mails to them over the last one month but even a single mail is answered by them. So, this company does not have any scope for customer service and grievance redressal. Also, the cashback as promised by it, was never rendered. I believe any such offer by MakeMyTrip is a sham and advise people not to use its services.",1
3078,"I had nothing but bad experience from them. Due to airlines rescheduling the flight, I had to cancel the flight. On 7th Nov, 2011, I called their customer support and explained the situation. After few minutes I was assured full refund and was asked to call after 48 hours. I called on 9th Nov 2011 and re-explained the problem - again was asked to wait for 48 hours before full refund to be issued. I called on 11th Nov and was told that refund is in process and will take 10 days!! Nothing happened in next days and I called them again on 21st Nov 2011. The support person told me that they were waiting for my bank account information to credit the money!! I asked her why was I not contacted and why they want to refund the money to my bank account whereas I had used my credit card to pay for the ticket. She had no explanation for it. I emailed my bank account details and called again on 23rd Nov 2011 to confirm if they received it. I got an email today (24th Nov 2011) confirming they received the details and to wait for 10 to 15 days for wire transfer to happen! You cannot talk to any reasonable person to explain your point of view, you cannot talk to their manager or supervisor - they run loose with their own rules! I wish I had read their reviews before buying from them!! Anyway, I am done with them and I hope you also get benefited by this review.",1
3079,"My first notification DONT BUY TICKETS UNLESS THE AGENT agrees what he says or you cross verify yourself Or BETTER DONT BUY TICKETS . I bought two tickets from PHL to HYD, with a connecting flight from BOM- HYD, through british airways which allows two checkin bags. MakeMyTrip agent mentioned that Jet airways will only charge 800 Rs for extra bag. When I called to Jet airways to confirm my fiight they mentioned they will allow one bag or$50 for extra bag if the ticket was made into one booking with departure from US. They verified that my BOM- HYD is a seperate domestic booking and it will charge 150 per kg for the extra bag. When I called to Makemytrip, the agent mentioned that they will refund the money which I pay to jet airways ie 150* 22 kgs, I said instead of that why dont you make my booking into one single booking. The system wont allow to do this change, but they can refund the money. The agents will keep you on hold till you get frustrated and you end the call yourself. They are just frauds. They represent a bad customer experience. So DONT BUY TICKETS from THEM.",1
3080,"They will overcharge you and take your money for ever you might save 10 dolalrs but will regret for ever why you got sucked into the marketing glitz.We called 7 or 8th time and their time keep getting extended. One person said 30 days, other said 48 hours other said 10 days. The company is in denial and other than the marketing has no ethics at all.I asked them to connect to their supervisor and they disconnected the phone after that. If anyone is interested we can file a class action suit in USA.",1
3081,"I planned my trip though make my trip and will never do it again. We were promised a deluxe hotel room at one of our locations during the trip. The room was horrible with no bed sheets, no soaps, no hand towels, TV not working etc. The other room they gave at another location was 60 kms away from the city even though they they had mentioned in the iterinary that it would be in the city. So most of our time was wasted in commute rather than site seeing. When we called our agent several times he refused to pick up the phone. Frustrating experience. Would not recommend it to a friend for sure.",1
3082,"Another victim of Makemytrip.com Be careful, never purchase your ticket, and never make any agreement with this company. This company is one of the most crooked, when it comes to refunding your money, as suppose to for full refundable tickets. Makemytrip, is invisible, fraudelent, and conspicous travel agency, located in India. The country where corruption and scandls rittle the country to an ablivion. They have reached agreement with Etihad airways, who would come up with every excuse to deny you both service and accommodation. I have been trying to reach them by every possible communication, yet they seem to have vanished from the face of the earth. They take your money and you will never hear from them again.",1
3083,"PLEASE DON'T MAKE ANY BOOKING WITH MAKEMYTRIP. This is such a horrible site. You have to wait for hours when you contact them through web chat or phone. Even the persons who speak from makemytrip will take long time and it will ruin the time. The money will be debited from the account immediately, which is the fastest thing they do. Then bad time starts for the passengers. No response for months if you send some request. Cant select seats, select meal preferences. I would suggest, go to kayak.com, then find the corresponding airline website to make the booking. Never go to this makemytrip.com. I bet if any one want to take a chance to ruin a trip, select makemytrip. You will definetly come back here to write a review, which will be horrible experience. Good news is there are many good websites like kayak, which points to correct website. so chose those.",1
3084,"Never ever get ticket from these peoples. they charged twice. they made mistake a lot. poor customer service. This is my first and last time. It takes long time to book a ticket. you need to call many times for your ticket. their price also higher. Some customer service people are very rude. also if you get ticket from usa or uk except india, all supporting document (ex: passport copy, credit card copy) u will sent to india which one I don't feel secure.",1
3085,Horrible experience with makemytrip. Booked 4 tickets for Kol-Delhi-Kol .the amount was debited immediately from the credit card but the booking failed. However they initiated the refund for only 2 passengers and for the rest they have no clue. They are a group of frauds.never trust.never buy.stay away.I am having terrible time of my life having to deal with their customer service over phone. They are a bunch of rude people and do not even have the basic courtesy to speak well with customers. Contempleting to sue them in the court. Why should genuine travellers suffer?,1

Apparently the room did not have bed sheets, soaps, hand towels, TV was not working etc. When we tried to call our agent in frustration he refused to pick up the phone.

3087,"MakeMyTrip are total fraudsters. I booked a flight from India to the UK which I missed. I called them to book me in another flight. They booked me a new ticket and charged me for it and said that the money for my original ticket will get credited to my account in a week's time, subject to the cancellation charges. I only received Rs. 6000 out of my Rs. 29000. I have written them so many emails but no reply. Everytime I write to them, I get a reference number to my complaint - no action taken in last 6 months.",1
3088,I was expecting a good deal from Make My trip. I did a hotel booking on the site Only thing is it was a confirmed booking which other sites are not able to give. But it was a rip off. the deals are atleast 30% more expensive. So my intention here is not to draw attention of make my trip but to others that if you want both a good deal and confirmed deal then go to Expedia and Cleartrip. I had raised this issue with make my trip but they simply said we do not entertain issues in this regard. .,1
3089,"First time booked a holiday with Make My Trip(MMT) and it would be my last time. In fact should be last time for all the people in my group. It’s theworst holiday experience** I ever had in my life. We booked holiday to Chiang Mai, Thailand during Durga Puja(holiday time in Kolkata), 2011. It was a group tour(4 nights) and MMT had chartered the flight. It was a short holiday to an offbeat destination and perfectly suited us. We made our bookings and also got the confirmation number. Later around 3 weeks before Pujas when one of my friends showed interest in the said holiday, I tried to show him the details from MMT website. But to my surprise the package no more existed on the web, the helpline told that Chiang Mai package isSOLD OUT. **The very next day I got to know that our trip is cancelled because of flight arrival issues at Chiang Mai. It is difficult to believe that they have started bookings without getting all the approvals, maybe there were not enough bookings. They offered to return the money or take an alternate package of Bangkok-Pattaya. We had already been to BKK/Pattaya, so requested for some other alternative but to no avail. The time was very close to Durga Puja and all air ticket prices had sky rocketed; we could either go to Bangkok/Pattaya or no vacation. We chose to go. Some days later I found from a daily mailer from MMT that they are also running 4 night package(similarly price) to Bankok/Phuket. I called them and requested to shift us to the later holiday package but they denied. Now comes the holiday part. We were excited, wanted to enjoy the holiday and not repent on what had already happened. But again we were let down. We arrived at the Bangkok airport at 4.30am. We were taken for breakfast, the food was pathetic and we came out hungry. Then we went to Pattaya and reached our hotel at around 10am. We were promised early check in at the time of booking but we got the room at 1.30pm. Being tired we slept, whole day was wasted. Very bad start indeed, all the people in the group were frustrated. The frustration continued throughout the trip because of the guide. He was totally confused, was not able to manage the group and said different plans for the day every time we meet him. All these lead to lot of chaos, confusion and time wastage. However, I would like to mention that the hotel(both Bangkok and Pattaya) were the same what they promised and wereexcellent**. Rest of the meals in the tour was also good. MMT is a reputed name in India and I expected a lot from them, but was highly disappointed. I wanted to share my experience so that the readers can take an informed decision while booking holiday package through MMT. Just wanted to add, I had made flight bookings through MMT website several times but never had any issues.",1
3090,"I had booked my honeymoon trip via makemytrip and had I not decided to get away, my trip would have been a disaster. Booked for malaysia & langkawi trip 2 months back. They promptly replied asking for payment after which visa processing would be done. After money was paid, no one turned. I had to go behind them asking them to arrange for VISA etc. There's this team that sits in Punjab(I guess - from the names of the representatives - Manmeet Kaur) who was supposed to be my point of contact, and after having called 20times over 8 days and mailed 10 times, I got no reply. To contact them back I decided to act as a new customer for this trip and then I caught her red handed! What ridiculous service. Even after that she never cared. After running around here and there for VISA, they booked us in AirMalaysia( PLS DON'T TRAVEL by this. - my trip was delayed by 1 day and becasue of which my hotel booked were all misaligned by a day and I had to pay for it.  and I came to know that it is quite common - I mean the delays) And the hotels?, they were decent, but the rooms provided to you, pathetic. they give you the cheapest rooms available. I had to pay extra to upgrade the rooms. We also had to wait for 5 hours at the waiting lobby because the hotels were booked only from 12pm, whereas our flights arrived at 7am. Amazing service They say they take us to good sightseeing places. Out of the top 50 places to visit, makemytrip took us to the last two visitable places- some khadi handrafts shop and some coffee shop( remember,  I am on my honey moon trip)- absolutely ridiculous. I decided to cut short their plan and planned my own itenary and had a nice time. You always have to wait for others who are sharing the trip and if there are bozos, then I guess, you know what happens. I decided to go on my own by renting a car. Overall, absolutely rubbish service. Well when you complaint to them, no one really bothers. (Actually this is not the first time, I had infact booked a hotel in Bangalore and these guys said that they haven't got confirmation from makemytrip and so I had to wait for 4 hours!) Bottomline - PLEASE AVOID MAKEMYTRIP services",1
3091,"I had booked a ticket from Bangalore to Srinagar. I received a mail from makemytrip saying if I book the cab though makemytrip I will get a voucher for 10% discount. I booked the easycab through them and received a voucher in my mail. I took the printout for the trip. When we actually reached airport and showed the voucher to cab driver, he replied that he has no idea about any such discount or voucher. When we showed him the voucher, he declined knowing anything about it and refused to give any discount. Ultimately since we were in hurry to go inside the airport and check-in for our flight in time, we gave him full money and left. I have been booking my tickets through makmytrip.com for a long time. I never faced any issue with flight tickets. If they cannot give an offer that really works, they shouldn't fool people by saying that they give some offers. When I called their customer care to complain about this, the agent gave me another number to complain about the cab. The number was actually out of service. When I called again, they gave me another number. The number went to somebody's personal mobile who has no idea what makemytrip is. Can't they make sure that the numbers they provide to the customers, actually work???",2
3092,"I had a booking with makemyrtrip.com for a return trip from Delhi to Kolkata few days back but due to some reason I had to cancel the booking.I just cancelled the returning flight i.e Kolkata to Delhi but they charged me Rs.1500(cancellation charge)+Rs250(their charge) to cancel the ticket...But their customer support executive told me that I will be charged Rs.750 + 250. But when asked about my case, he told me to put the call on hold and never retrieved the call.Tried calling them many times but getting the same thing continues.I suggest everyone to boycott makemytrip.com.They are a bunch of crap!!They are cheaters making business just by harassing people like us!!!..NEVER EVER BUY ANYTHING FROM MAKEMYTRIP.COM...YATRA.COM IS BETTER THAN MAKEMYTRIP.COM I heard...But my suggestion would be buy the tickets directly from the airline website..I even got cheaper tickets while booking a flight directly. Makemytrip is the worst. NEVER FALL IN THEIR TRAP!",1
3093,"We booked this hotel Through Heritage Holidays( A Delhi Based organization) for 3  nights stay in Ooty mainly based on location and the scenic view of the  hotel. Not much amenities, but still its a unique experience to stay  here. Service is so so( Neither very good nor very Bad) but cottages are really  good and can accommodate easily 4 persons. Food quality is excellent and  ambience is truly amazing. Small hotel though, but its my favorite destination  when it comes to lazy & relaxing vacation. Staff is really friendly  except the one person namely Mr. Albert Milto who was handling the reception on  the tome of our check in. All other activities like camp-fire etc even though  there is a nature challenge. I have been there for more than 5-6 times with my  friends and family and all of them rated this hotel as the best place to stay  and spend time. Sagar Holidays is a place you would definitely come back  to and recommend to your friends. Thank you very much for making our stay so  pleasant! Suggestion:Try  to get cottage nearer to lift section Thanks, Romy Tomas",3
3094,Horrible customer service.  Please do not book your flight ticket from them.  They take several mins of hold time and they will charge horondous amount of money to cancel or change your ticket even for medical reasons.  It took me 2 hours to cancel my ticket for a medical reason and still I had to pay a lot of money over what the airline would have charged me for it. Beware of the website it lures you into this vicious net of bad people. Bad customer service.,1
3095,Please.. my request is not to book any online tickets through Makemytrip.com. They are simply useless. They have played with our bookings and when complained could not resolve it. they just want to fool others. I want to see any of the local person in hyderabad. Its an idiot company in simple. If any of the team people have gutts call me on my cell. 9849433000. They don't even bother to take any calls. their call center calls disconnect the moment you dial for cancellation or date change.,1

3097,"Just got back from OOTY with heritage holidays had booked a 4 day trip under Take a Break offer, long drive but nice hotel and welcome nice big room. From the moment we boarded the coach, with a friendly greeting from Patrick, we had no complaints about the journey which was smooth with plenty of stops. He was courteous, pleasant, informative, but never intrusive. We were warmly greeted at the SAGAR RESORTS with luggage dealt with efficiently. One of us is disabled and was given every consideration, with a ground floor room which was well appointed, with a good vie, and were impeccablky kept. we would have liked a little more time at each place, but it meant we saw so much and definitely want to go back. The staff were extremely efficient and meals were served smoothly, with plenty of variety and of good quality. And mention must be made of Patrick, our driver. I had reservations about doing such a holiday, being disabled, but he looked after us all extremely well. We couldn't have had a better driver. We were a litttle concerned after reading one or two of the reviews, but did wonder what people expected. A little homework would have confirmed whther this was the right holiday to choose. We did ours, and do not regret it!",3

I did not want to worry you but on the second day of the trip when we were in  Munna, I had a fall from the rocks and needs some stitches on my lips. Rajesh was very helpful and considerate and drove me to the nearest hospital so I could receive the relevant treatment.  Can you please convey our sincere thanks to his owner and, of course, you’re Delhi Office(Amman and Ravi) who were always at the end of the phone for any questions or advice. In fact before your arrival, they had contacted us a couple of times to find out how our trip was processing and if we needed any assistance. Our impression of the whole trip was that we were very well looked after and the aftercare was exceptional. My sister and her husband are hoping to make a trip later on in the year and I shall be giving your details to her so please do assist them.

I tried to contact them for a month to prepone my flight.They didn't resolve my problem & never responded my call. If I call US they tell me to call INDIA. If I call india they tell me to call up to us number or some one from india call us back which they never did.,2

I had booked some flight tickets and had to cancel them due to some health issues, I called them after waiting for 20 minutes thay told me that the system was down and I should directly call the airline, get the ticket cancelled and everything would work out automatically - I called the airline number pronted on my e-ticket the number was invalid, then I found the airline number from internet - called them and got the ticket cancelled. A few days later when I did noy get any update on the cancellation, I called them again - and now the guy said I will have to pay 3000 Rs. in pemnalties when I told him everything he said it would be 1500 Rs....I told him that your e-ticket says the penalty is Rs 650 - why do you charge more than double - he says it is because of the Airline. At the time of cancellation, the airline had clearly told me that the cancellation fine would be Rs 650. The makeMyTrip agent tells me to get it in writing from the airline on a stamp paper and then get back to Makemytrip. UNBELIEVABLE. This is probably the worst type of service and system that is used on this site....Not sure if there are other alternatives for online booking.",1

My booking ID NF252369311179 Canceled 2 tickets and the total refund should have been Rs. 3566 wherein they made a calculation mistake(i have a feeling that it is intentional, as same thing happened last time) and returned Rs 988. I spoke to almost 4 of their customer care executive at several occasions. All of them accepted the fault and promised to rectify withing 48 hours. One of them did try to negate my claim citing some weird reason and after I insisted disconnected without resolving . Nothing happened. Then I made a call to their nearest office, the lady assistant manager again made a similar promise and nothing happened. The thing is if its Makemytrip's fault why should I loose money calling their guys and wasting my precious time. I am formally writing a complain and would like to elevate the case to concern departments and agencies . I have observed many complaints like this on many of the forums.",1

3107,"One of the worst customer service ever experienced, canceled a ticket 70 days back still haven't received my refund. I would had called more than 50 times to their customer Service, never I got a proper response, they try to bluff their customers. I had received three Refund Transaction numbers, but still I haven't received my Refund, every time they say ""your money will be reflecting in your account with in 2 to 3 working days""",1

I dont  ever use makemytrip for online booking. I discussed this with Travel  agenci es, they telling me not to go through makemytrip. Come to them call them directly cancellation doesn't cost you much there. maximum  200 Rupees.. Never ever use this site!",1
3109,"Had a disastrous encounter with MMT today. They took my money on Apr  28th for Flight Booking on KingFisher IT-306 30th April 9 AM, no  E-Ticket was issued till 1 AM(8 hours before the flight). The CC  executive promised a ticket in 60 mins, waited, got no update. Called  again, they told me there is some problem and they are going to issue me  a Refund now. WTF? After 2 Days, 6 hours before the flight, they are backing out? Called King Fisher and they confirmed that the flight is on schedule, my name is not there and is fully booked. AWESOME. Called in the Morning at 8 AM, CC Executive asks me to book another  ticket, complimentary and then asks me to stay on hold for 5 mins,  Disconnects me, I call again, explain again, offered the same help, ask  me to hold and they disconnect me. I call again, and this time they say I WAS actually issued a Ticket.  OMG, a wonderful Hindi Story with the twist and turns. Surprisingly, If I  was indeed issued a Ticket, why didn’t I get any Email/SMS and besides  that why was I offered a refund and complimentary ticket in the morning? Updated - There is a site called https://ruinedmytrip.com/ where lot of make mytrip complaints have  been posted. Check it out for more experiences",1
3110,Asked for their manager who is equally not familiar with the process. They take money first and refunding is a nightmare. Never send email details because they will ask for it again and again since the guy you email to originally will be on vacation. No common Email system. There usual dialog call after 2 hours our servers are down. I have spent close to 10 hours with them and no resolution. The cut the lines to be connected again.,1
3111,"I booked a volvo ticket from Manali to Delhi from makemytrip.com. The bus operator was kanak travels. When we went to board the bus, to our disappointment bus was in very bad shape with seats torned and extremely dirty. We complaint the same to the bus staff there who didnt listen to us and started behaving like gundas. They said, its upto you if you want to travel and if you say anything else we will throw you and your bag out of bus. They also said do complaint to bus operator(kanak travels) or the tour operator  (MMT), we are least bothered. Thereafter, I made call to kanak travels which ignored our complaint and then we called MMT , they said we will drop a mail to bus operator and refund your money. For now, we suggest you to board the bus. We followed their advice. On reaching Delhi, when we contacted back MMT, they showed their true colors. Every time I called them they said we have dropped mail to vendor and waiting for a revert from him. For 15 days, story remained same. Meanwhile, I also started mail conversation with MMT and also showed them the photo of the bus seats on which we traveled. Finally they said, that the operator has agreed to refund  you Rs 300 for the inconvineance   which is too less as I have bought tickets for Rs 2400. Furthermore, They havent taken any action against the operator. Please beware before making any bookings with these frauds Thanks",1

3113,"I recently went for a trip (Swiss Paris Delight) in mid july with my family. Their unprofessionality began from the airport itself when the tour manager could not trace the Italian Coach driver & could not understand or make him understand of the action to be taken. We were waiting for more than an hour OUTSIDE THE AIRPORT!!! and after the tour manager found him, they parked the coach in the middle of the road & police officer forced them to leave immediately while half of our luggage was still lying on the streets & the driver has to exit the airport & come back again after a journry of 10 minutes with my luggage on the street. During the tour, the tour manager & Italian driver had a evrbal fight & we were left in the middle of nowhere. 6 days trip rushed to an end within 4 days. Never ever travel with these unprofessional team. We are spending our time and money and every second is valueable , but with such kind of organisation ""It all scks!",1

I booked seats for my family on MMT and had to suffer through out the journey as my booking was sold by the operating company to another operating company at 35% discount. Beware from using MMT, I had been consistent and sincere in reporting and following up on issue faced with photograph evidence etc but it's of no avail. Hope this helps, just don't want others should get harassed and humilated due to trusting MakeMyTrip. Arun.",1
3115,"I have a very bad experience with makemytrip. I booked a ticket for a tour and I find I booked it for a seat where as I was looking for sliper, immediately next minute I went to cancel it and they charged me 400 rs. while my ticket cost was 800rs. Rather than this I would prefer to go to travel agent and book the ticket. I would suggest not to go for this service at all. Payal",1
3116,"I should have read reviews before I booked my ticket from makemytrip.com. I booked my ticket from Raleigh-London-Mumbai. After booking my ticket, I realised that the timings shown on there website on all the flights wasOFF by one hour from the timings on the e-Ticket issued to me. So I called and emailed them 10 times(not exagerting) to cancel the flight with full refund, but these IDIOTS was never getting the problem. One time I called and explained my case, but the support person was not getting the problem, so I asked her to handover the phone to her supervisor, and she litreally hung up on me. Everytime I call, I have explain my problem. Even after so many calls they haven't cancel the ticket with full refund. NEVER EVER GIVE BUSINESS TO THIS COMPANY! UTTER MISMANAGEMENT, NO RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS CUSTOMER! THIS COMPANY WILL NOT SURVIVE FOR LONG!",1
3117,"This is THE worst company - yes promised cancellation possible and changes - but you CAN NOT do it on their web site. When I called I got cut off so many times that I was trying for 3 hours. When I would get to a point to an available date change - I would - guess what. GET CUT OFF! NEVER EVER AGAIN will I EVER book a flight with this stupid, idiotic company. American Airlines should not allow this company to be associated with MAKEMY TRIP (EFFED UP!!) HORRIBLE! PEOPLE should complain to the airlines too - that this terrible company represents them!",1

3119,"Guys beware when they write ticket as refundable they still charge INR 1000 that too not for ticket rather per person. I had to change my plan for next to next week travel and called their call center immediately after my booking but they said they will charge me INR 1000 per person for four people.

3120,"My experience with Make my Trip is very bad/horrible. I booked ticket for my trip from Nigdi(Pune) to Thane. Trip fare was Rs 500/- per person. The bus provider mentioned on the ticket was SP Travels & pickup point was Surbhi Travels Nigadi.There was no contact no of Pickup point We tried to contact the SP travels to locate the pickup point but the number given was of Tamilnadu & SP travel person informed that they don't provide any such bus service from Puna to Thana. Somehow we located pickup point . We had to reach there half an hour before. When we enquired there , Surbhi travel person was also not aware of any such bus service. After a lot of struggle we somehow got the bus driver's no with the help of other passengers .After calling the bus driver every time we were told that bus will reach in 10 minute. We had to wait there for almost 1 hour & finally the bus arrived.To our surprise it was a bus for Ahmadabad via Thana & we were charged for full ticket upto Ahmadabad. After handing over the copy of ticket we were allowed inside the bus. After some time we were again asked for the copy of ticket... as the person to whom we had given the ticket had got down & new person was replaced. We had to fight for our own rights....with full of horrible shocks , one after another somehow we made our trip to Thane. Manisha",1
3121,The worst service in my life I got from Makemytrip.com. I had booked a ticket online for my wife and kid for a travel from Bhubaneswar to Bangalore in India via Makemytrip.com. via Booking ID NF251386376005. I cancelled the ticket vide cancellation reference number IN1106R0022109 on 4th of June. We got the confirmation mail for the cancellation. As per the customer care executive over phone I should have got the refund amount credited to my account within 7 days. After waiting for 17 days on 22nd June I sent a mail to the customer care of Makemytrip.com asking for a refund immediately. I got a reply my mail as a confirmation of receiving my mail. Reference number issued to my mail was Reference:110622-027647. On 23rd june I was asked for my bank account details so that they can send the money to my account. I replied immediately with all the bank account details. I got a reply on 28th of June with the information that the refund process has been initiated and I need to wait for 72 working hours to get the payment credited to my account. 72 hours was too much to get a payment. So I enquired and got a mail again saying that it will take another 3 days. On 2nd July I wrote another mail asking for the status of the payment as 3 days was already over. I got a reply saying that I the refund is already made on 29th of June and I need to check my account. Surprisingly I did not see anything credited to my account. I immediately replied asking for the payment details. The reply I got today is that I need to wait for 21 days from 29th June to see the amount credited to my Account. This is the worst I can say. I have never got such a service from anyone.,1
3122,"Although, they offer good deals, but their approach towards the consumers are highly irresponsible. in today's world of consumerism how can they think of surviving long in the market with this approach. Highly unprofessional attitude of their customer care Representative, they are bunch of crooks and adopt fraudulent malpractices with customers. Must amend their ways to stay in market. Their representative was trying to sell me deal which I actually got cheaper online. Now i'll think twice before making any bookings with them. I really doubt if writing all this would make any difference to their attitude and approach. I think by now they must be used to listening all this and act like deaf.",1
3123,"Make My Trip is good at selling but least bothered about servicing customers. If their is any problem post buying from them, they are least concerned. The service industry is suppose to be very personalized but they are hardly bothered about the inconveniences faced by their customers due to faulty service by their hotels/ flight/bus operators. The rating for hotels on their site is all faulty- in fact most 3 star rated don't qualify for 1 star rating.",1
3124,"I have made multiple bookings using makemytrip.com during the past two years and here is my review. 1) Flights cost more than most of the other website.  You are baited by giving a discount after the the price is increased but even after the discount you pay more than when booked on other website. I have always found some website cheaper than make my trip. 2) Hotels:  Make mytrip.com always increases the hotel rates and then gives a discount which usually comes to nearly same as on other websites . But the hotels which are available on makemytrip.com are bad hotels which cannot sell their rooms because of poor quality and service . Again the worst rooms in those bad hotels are provided to make my trip customers. 3) I have never booked holidays using make my trip but my comparison has shown they are pretty expensive and poor quality compared to the money they charge. I have checked many packages and they seem very expensive and the hotels they provide in the packages are very bad. Now I have decided that I will book the hotels directly or the other option is to stay in a homestay's which give a 5 star kind of facilities for much cheaper price. But there are some disadvantages also. 4) Train booking: I prefer to book train tickets using the make my trip as I hate the Indian Railways website. I pay an extra as an agent fee but it's much easier to manage my trips. May be people who are used IRCTC.in may find it better. This is one experience I had with make my trip when I booked a hotel.( I have booked hotels through make my trip many times) I had made the booking from make my trip by paying full money. The hotel name is Hotel Aston in Kolkota. Just one days before my stay date, the hotel called me saying that they cannot give me the room as make my trip.com had not made the payment. Then I had to call makemytrip.com and they immediately said payment will be arranged. After some time the hotel called back again saying that they have received only the partial payment and they will not be able to give me the room till they receive the full payment. I called makemytrip.com again when they said everything has been settled and the room is confirmed. Reaching the hotel at 11:45pm in the night the hotel asked me to make an extra payment for the room leaving me no option. In conclusion my findings are, there is no advantage booking using makemytrip.com, but you spend extra. Do some reserach and surely you will get atleast 10 -20% cheaper on other websites, the same what you are planning to book from makemytrip. Thanks Manmath",1
3125,"I got three tickets to India and one of the name was misprinted. They charged me extra amount for cancellation and sold back the same ticket for very high price(even though they had tickets in other flights for lesser price-they knew that I can't book the third ticket in another flight as I can't seperate my parents). It costed 1000$ more for me. They charged me the foreign transaction fee on my card. They charged me the amount both times when I used the card even though I had conversation with the customer care for the second time and they promised it will not happened(they charged huge amount). They refunded my foreign transaction fees after 30 days and ticket cancellation amount after 45 days(even though the cancellation form clearly mentions 8-10 business days). And guess what...they refunded me the wrong amount....after several emails and treating them that I will file a case against them, they refunded the remaining amount in 60 days. Finally, if you have patience in dealing with irresponsible customer care service, you can go ahead with them.",1
3126,"I had to change the travel date due to leg injury. When I called to change the reservation, the agent told me I could proceed with the date change and handle penalty waiver independently. He had said I could submit required paperwork via email and they'll appeal to the airline to waive the date change penalty. When I called to submit the docs, a second agent told me it was not possible, contradicting themselves. A supervisor offered to lookup call recording and respond to me within 24 hours. I did not hear back from them and when I called for follow-up, the agent told me they couldn't locate the recording! Most of all, I did not like the service agent's attitude, there was no regret for their mistake. They've lost my business for sure!",1
3127,I was tring to book an flight . During the transaction amount got deducted but their was no confirmation.... After 100 calls for almost 4 weeks ... they keep changing their response everytime I call.... As of today they are saying they have tried to refund but it is not updated in the account.... Bank peoples higher management is willing to help me if they know what is the problem being faced by make my trip...... But this MMT doesn't even give proper status.... few times they just diconnect the call.... Still awaiting for an refund.... I should have first looked at this site before doing an transaction with this MMT (Making money theif)... If I knew the location they pick the customer care calls. I pretty sure I would go their and blown up their heads......,1
3128,"I booked a holiday to himachal pradesh after reading advertisement in leading newspapers and Lonely Planet Magazine. I had also read about the promoter Deep Kalra(ex IIM Ahmedabad) in the book ""Stay hungry Stay foolish""and thought it would be a highly credible business. This business is a disgrace for e-commerce. It puts customers through such distress that it maligns the entire e-commerce industry. This is to caution all my dear country men and women to be wary. It is true these guys hide behind automated lines to escape accountability and responsibility. It is better to pay more and book through local agents whom u can catch and who cannot escape from you when things go wrong.",1

I sincerely suggest not to go with this service and suffer in case if your trip gets cancelled or airlines cancelled the flight. Thanks VS",1
3130,I have been through so much that I just want to let all of you know that it is better to pay more than book through this website. Trust me you would be doing yourself a huge favour.

All they give you is lies and false timelines and now thorugh automation they have made sure you cannot talk to anyone except for the illeterate call centre guys.,1
3131,Make My Trip - which is so called India's No. 1 Company Travel Company just cheats customers. I have had a very bad experience with this company. I had booked a room in a resort through MakeMyTrip website & I got confirmation that room is booked. Later when I went with my family to the resort I was told that the room is not booked at all. Beside loosing huge money to MakeMyTrip - just because I trusted company the entire family was in streets. I suggest all users not to use MakeMyTrip as this company only cheats.,1
3132,"Copy of email I wrote to feedback - let me know if you have any senior managements contact numbers. Name: xxx Booking ID: xxx Email: xxx Phone: xxx Complaint I don't have complaint ID but you would find the note if you look up on your system with booking ID. I have had series of interactions with your customtakeouter service, particularly one agent named VRINDA SIKKA and had horrible post-sale experience with her. I booked my holiday package to Laddakh starting May 15th through her in early March. She was very helpful during booking process and clarified my questions in 2-3 calls. Of total payment of 61, 545/-, I paid first installment of 30, 000/- then. After that my trouble started. That's beginning of ridiculous policy and hassles associated with it. As it will become soon apparent to me, anything to do with my package must be handled by VRINDA directly. And obviously, I have no way to reach her directly. Nor can any of your agents seem capable of transferring call. Further, her work timings were unknown to me or to other agents. In one signature, she sends her direct number. Not sure if it was by mistake but she never did the same again and perhaps changed her signature. Not that it helped because she hardly picks up even after calling multiple times. Coming back to payment, after 2 calls, VRINDA calls me to take payment and sends link to MakeMyTrip's online gateway. That's only email I have from her which gave me her personal email ID and direct phone number so crucial to reach her directly. While I was assured that travel vouchers and ticket would follow, they didn't. After 2-3 calls to agents, I get hotel vouchers from someone other than VRINDA. I still didn't get tickets. Rinse and repeat. Agent 2-3 calls, and finally VRINDA sends me my hotel vouchers(again) and travel tickets. After my trip is concluded, I wanted invoice for LTA purpose. Please note that I still had not received any confirmation or invoice of second installment of payment. Obviously, again only VRINDA can give me invoice and agent says that she has mailed to VRINDA to call me back. After waiting another week and not hearing from her, I call her directly and email her. Only multiple attempts over multiple days she picks up phone, and says that she will send me my invoice. After waiting for few more days, I still don't get anything. Neither does she reply to me nor does she pick up my phone. On 2nd June when she pick up my phone she HUNG UP ON ME after I reminded about the invoice. On next day, I call again and an agent named JAVED informs me that he is sale supervisor and will ensure that I get reply within 24 hours. He also refuses to transfer me to VRINDA or to VRINDA's supervisor. Today is 7th June and obviously I've not heard from anyone. VRINDA has not replied to my emails. JAVED has not kept his promise, she refuse to pick direct calls, other agents cannot help because of your policy and I am stuck here drafting a long mail hoping for some help. Apparently, you don't seem to keen on receiving complaints either. Forms on contact management(https://MakeMyTrip.custhelp.com/app/sharefeedback) and Feedback page(https://MakeMyTrip.custhelp.com/app/customtakeouter_feedback) aren't working and hence I am writing at this email address. My complaints are as follows: I have received very pathetic post-sale support from VRINDA SIKKA and I had to call multiple times to even get basics of my booking. Her support after trip in terms of invoice, not replying and hanging up on me has been horrible. I seek just remedy for my hassles. In all this drama, my basic requirement of an invoice for LTA purpose with breakup of lodging, boarding and travel has been ignored. I seek this invoice immediately. Make My Trip has been website of my choice as you can see history of bookings on my user ID ""talktoashish@gmail.com"". Clearly too large a size and listing in NYSE has pushed customtakeouter service in gutter. I may not go ahead and makeRuinedMyTrip.combut this experience has definitely impacted my future dealings with MMT. Regards, xxx",2
3133,"My opinion; Arrogant customer support. No transparency in the charges;conditions. Best used as a search engine. Find the hotels, read reviews, book with hotel directly! Find the flights, connections and book with the airline directly. Had good experience with flight bookings...probably coz I never had to cancel flights and talk to customer support.... However, things changed when I booked a hotel with them. So in my booking, I did not declare the children below 2 years and saved myself a few 100s ( the hotel was ok when I checked in with the kids). Sad, I was able to see thru this trick! You compare across sites and find the makemytrip offering the cheapest room rate. However, I had pay extra amount for some taxes at the hotel ( at the end it wasnt cheaper). I pay up the extra amount and later call the customer support. Response from Call 1: Sir, with makemytrip you always need to pay the additional taxes at the hotel. My question: Why does the booking confirmation, say all Taxes paid? Response Call 1: Please provide this feedback to us via the website, we cannot help you with that. -I send an email; ( auto email promises response with 24hr);no response for 4 days; Call again; dropped; call again; response: we cant help you with that. and am educated about how the tax is from the central govt. And, yes, apart from ""Welcome to makemytrip"", ""have a good day"", the tone is rude from customer support. Am not buying from Makemytrip anymore.",2

However amount was charged to my credit card account. Upon calling makemytip agent agreed that transaction has been failed and refund id is NF252366099771 which will be processed in 72hrs. 72hrs what as shame. Today is 13th day and Makemytrip is sleeping. I called several times(Booking ID NF252366099771) and sent email too but everytime same recorded message that it will take 72hrs. ha ha ha at this time of competetion they are treating customer like this.

It is very sad as well as surprising to see this company continuing to lure gullible folks into their vice like tentacles and forcing them to cough out huge premiums on air travel both domestic and international.  What to say!  This is Kalyug my friends!",1
3143,"Hi, Can I expect a response from the makemytrip team?  Its really unprofessional. I have got two hotel vouchers from makemytrip and validity of these vouchers were upto 7 June. Out of these two vouchers, one voucher was successfully applied  although second one gave errors. I raised the issue on the 7 th June itself, and there is no response till now. This is terrible and if I don't get a response, I will never come on MMT in the near future. Reference ID 160607-069785",1

3145,"This is with respect to a planned holiday to Jim Corbett on 22nd April 2011, which we (me and my three friends) made the mistake of planning it through “Make My Trip”. The booking was properly confirmed or I say (eagerly done) by the “Make My Trip” Executive. The full amount has been deducted from the Credit card Account instantaneously (18th Apr 2011). We are happy, and thinking to enjoying the holiday period. But on Last day 21st April(around 01:00 PM), I got the call from Ahmadabad Office (Calling Number: +917940278750), stating that the booked rooms are not available and the planned holidays need to be cancelled or need to be redone to a cheaper location. I got shocked and told that lady to check this up with Mohammad Zia as he has confirmed the bookings to me. At the booking time, I have asked Mohammad many times (at least thrice), is Everything OK and how the Hotel will be notified. He confirmed Sir don't worry its 110% confirmed. This has also spoiled our holiday plan. We lost Rs 12000 paid to Tempo Traveler, Jeep & Elephant Safari bookings as advance. It seems they are doing intentionally with all the customers as 1 >> Deducting the Full Amount of the holiday package at the time of booking over the telephone and confirming planned holiday. 2 >> Not Updating the Customer, that the booking is tentative and cancellation can happen. 3 >> No written communication for the cancellation process. No SMS or Email. Two different departments sharing different things to the customer. So please since I faced such shocking incident, making me loose Rs12000 apart from mental harassment would never recommend anyone to take services from them I was earlier notified by one of my team member that a year back he faced same situation I ignored it thinking it may have happened once in blue moon. But now since it can't be a co-incident would like to save you people from doing the mistake I did.",1
3146,"I made a booking throughMs Lakshmi Devi *for my Darjeeling-Kalimpong-Gangtok trip. I had requested to book a3-star category hotel *at all places. I was confirmed the same by the executive. Before leaving, I had asked her about Hotel Seven Seventeen whether its a 3-star or not. She told its a 3-star rated hotel. When I reached there, to my surprise and anguish, I found a useless hotel booked for me. The hotel rooms were very small, with stained, torn bedsheets, uncleaned floor, bathrooms, stinking clothes etc. When I tried calling the executive to check/change my booking, I was asked to wait for some time and she would call back, but never done so. The hotel in Kalimpong was average hotel (Garden Reach) but the service was very poor. We were offered only bread as breakfast one morning and they made us wait for other breakfast for half an hour and nobody turned up after that. Finally, the hotel at Gangtok(Silk Route Residency) was the worst. The rooms were stinking like hell. They had not changed the bed sheets for quite some days, so stained and torn at places. Overall, my trip was spoiled because of poor response from Ms Lakshmi Devi. Whenever I called her, I was given some hypothetical reply, which surely is not practical. She asked me to contact customer care for addressing my grievances and assured that my hotel booking shall be changed. I wonder why should I do so?? Till the time I had not done the transaction of money, I got calls from her, but once I sent money, I didnot get proper response, leave alone getting some positive act. I also told her during my last call that if such is the response from you people, I will assure that I never do a hotel booking through these guys and also ensure that nobody known to me falls in your trap, because all they need is money and not customer satisfaction.",1

On calling Spice Jet they were nice enough to understand the problem and canceled the tickets so I could book earlier flights, and confirmed a refund back to makemytrip since they were the travel agents in between, and asked me to contact makemytrip. On calling makemytrip and waiting for several minutes I was told that out of the 10, 000+ refund that Spicejet had issued to them they would only refund about 8700 out of it.I was dissapointed, however, the situation required me to rush back, hence I said ok and asked them to refund back to the credit card. They confirmed this and mentioned that the amount would be refunded back within 3 business days. This conversation happened on 4th April and today is the 20th and several calls to makemytrip.they just keep putting you on hold and hang up. I called Spicejet once again to confirm, and again they confirmed that the refund has been issued.

After further talking, they also mentioned that makemytrip has done such things several times earlier also and still doing. How Irresponsible is that. It seems that makemytrip use to do such mismanagement regularly. I recommend you NEVER BOOK HOTEL ROOM OR OTHERS WITH MAKEMYTRIP AS ITS RISKY. Its completely a MORONIC SHITTY COMPANY. They ruined our vacation at the first the very first day. When we asked the staff after 4-5 days after checkin date, & they still Not received the same from makemytrip. When contacted makemytrip about this, they said they will investigate & respond back. And even now after 3 weeks, they have Not yet responded back. I think I should contact the bank for receiving the refunds and let makemytrip pay the chargeback fines.

3163,"Guys - Be warned, when you have to cancel / re-schedule a trip check exactly what are the Airline charges and do not pay extra to makemytrip. This is illegal business and hope mine is isolated case, if not legal action has to be taken against makemytrip.com I booked HYD - Del and Del - HYD ticket on Kingfisher airline through Makemytrip.com. Later as my plans got changed, I had to cancel the booking. I called Makemytrip but as no one was picking up the phone, I called Kingfisher directly and got my tickets cancelled. Cancellation charges were Rs.650.00 for outbound and Rs.200.00 for inbound. Later I had to call Makemytrip again for the refund and they told me that the cancellation charges will be as follows: for the outbound flight the airline cancellation fees is Rs.750.00 and Makemytrip cancellation fees will be Rs.250.00 and same for inbound flight. I challenged the person (Hiten) and he said, no this is what it is. I then insisted that Airline cancellation fees is not correct and it's illegal for you to charge me extra in the name of airline cancellation fees. I threatened him that I will take legal action. Then he said, OK he will have to reconfirm with airline. After 10 mins, he came back and said he cannot reach airline. I then said, Kingfisher is good at picking up phone and responding to queries so I don't believe you, either you confirm back in next 5 mins or I want to talk to your senior and I just didn't budge. Then after 10 mins on hold, Hiten confirmed airline cancellation fees will be Rs.650 and Rs.200 and not Rs.750 for each flight.

They have no clue about what their finance deptt is up to, the CSR reps make false promises on refunds and its been 02 months since they have been promising refunds. They owe me over 40K on this failed booking, which too was a result of some glitch in their system (when I hit the payment button, it said page timed out but still charged me). So I think in spite of them having a sizeable market share in terms of this service, their organisation is poor at handling such issues. You try speaking to a manager and there will never be one available. I think other than suing them, there is no way left for me to get my money back.

3172,"I am going through an ordeal with Makemytrip.com. I chose Makemytrip to book a vacation for some friends visiting from outside India thinking that it would be convenient to have one agency responsible for all the hotels and cab, etc. Initially, everything went off well. They were able to find a decent itinerary and a decent price. Disaster stuck a few days later when on checking the hotel and cab vouchers I found that I had been listed as the passenger instead of my friends. I informed Makemytrip about it and for days they claimed that they were working on updating the vouchers. Finally, when it was the day before the trip I frantically called them and they assured me that I would get the revised vouchers that evening. I was relieved when the vouchers arrived with no mistakes in them. However, the next morning I was horrified to find out that the taxi that came to receive them was refusing to take them because the taxi company had not been informed by Makemytrip about the correction in the voucher. It took an hour and calls by me to Makemytrip, the cab driver and the cab company owner to get their journey started. All seemed to be going smoothly until this morning. My friends were trying to check out from their hotel in Thekkady but were not allowed to because the hotel had not yet been paid by Makemytrip. I spent over 2 hours on the phone with both Makemytrip and the hotel to help my friends check out. Makemytrip's representative, Nausheen Mansuri kept making excuses that the payment was made already and that their was some problem with the transfer. I told them that if there was a problem, it should be sorted out between the hotel and Makemytrip. My friends had paid Makemytrip in full and did not deserve the rest of their vacation to be ruined by justing waiting at the reception cluelessly. After so many calls the truth finally emerged. Makemytrip had not made the transfer. Since Makemytrip does not enjoy any credit with the hotel(because of previous payment problems), the hotel staff called Makemytrip to get the transfer done but Makemytrip was lazy, incompetent and uncaring. They actually had the audacity to tell the hotel to keep the guests waiting till the transfer came through and then after that stopped taking calls from the hotel. To me, Makemytrip's representative, Nausheen Mansuri, lied that the problem was at the hotel end. At first I was willing to give Makemytrip the benefit of the doubt until they started cutting my call and refusing to put me in touch with their supervisor. Just heard that Makemytrip has sorted things out with the hotel after keeping my friends waiting for over 3 hours. They still have another 4 days left on their vacation and I shudder to think what else Makemytrip will screw up. Already they have wasted over 3 hours which could have been spent on the houseboat from Alleppey to Kumarakkom. I am expecting that Makemytrip resolves this problem and compensates my friends for their lost time. Watch this space I will let you know how Makemytrip treats my friends and whether they make up for their screw ups.",1

3176,"I am writing this review for 2 purposes: 1) To alert innocent travelers like me to book holiday packages through credit cards on phone by MakeMyTrip. 2) Need advice on what legal action I have now to sue MakeMyTrip. I did a booking on MakeMyTrip on 19-Dec-2010 for a holiday trip to ooty starting from 24th Jan. Booking ID is IN1012B08035 ( Sanjay Bisht - Makemytrip representative who did the booking) . I received booking confirmation mail and it was clearly mentioned in that if cancellation is done 4 weeks to 7 days prior to date of journey then 60% amount will be refunded. Due to personal reasons I had to cancel the booking . I canceled the booking on 12/27/2010. I sent a personal mail to Sanjay Bisht of MakeMyTrip to cancel the booking but did not get any response. After that I called MakeMyTrip no and at that time a lady spoke nicely to me and told around 80-85% amount will be refunded . I was really happy about that. A few days later on 1st Jan 2011 I called them again to check about my refund status then Tapesh from MakeMyTrip picked the call and replied that no cancellation has been done on the booking  and it is clearly written on the voucher that refund will be only 60% and not 85% . I adviced him to cancel the trip immediately and at least give me 60% refund as still there are more than 3  weeks remaining. He told that 60% amount will be definitely refunded to my credit card in 5 working days. After this I had called MakeMyTrip several times( Ranjit - 6th Jan, Justin - 23rd Jan) Everyone is saying amount will be refunded but still after more than a month nothing is being refunded to my account. I called them again on 3rd feb and a lady picked up the call before I could give my complete details the call was cut and then I tried several times and my call is being cut. I am totally stunned and frustrated with the treatment meted out to me from such a reputed firm. Then I read several makemytrip reviews and am wondering how come they are still in business with this fraud. Finally I would like to know if there is any legal action that I can take against makemytrip. I have email proof which I sent to makemytrip regarding cancellation and also the phone call details. Thanks and Regards, Avishek N",1
3177,"I am Manohar reddy from hyd. I booked 4 days package via makemytrip.com to Maldives from dec28th to Jan 1st 2011. we travelled to herathera islands with my parents and 2 young kids and we booked 3 jacuzzi beach villas. We paid full adult price of Rs 53, 999/each so we can get 3 villas with jacuzzi. Just to give you an idea., here are are some highlights. No Servicer: We did not get our e- tickets from makemytrip.com till the last day 28 th dec tuesday. By then we started from hyd to Mumbai and we had to struggle to print them in mumbai. I had to call them so many times and send email on 27 th for tickets and ankit Gupta your rep sends a hotel voucher 27 th night and says wait for e tickets. I am not sure he even bothered to call us inspire of our emails and phone calls( mail box is full to leave messages) we are cheated: We booked for 3 jacuzzi villas and on the boat from gan airport to hear Thera at 4 am makemytrip.com rep viraf informs the group that because Of power outage we need to be accommodated in beach villas not in jacuzzi villas. Though make my trip knows about it by 1 pm on tues day we got to know it once we were there. Our villa nos are 212, 213, 214. We felt cheated as this information was not informed in advance or at the gan airport . Tie up with bad property: We checked into villas that. Have no free access to beach. There are shrubs and trees that cover beach, so really its not beach villas. All our expectations gone down the drain. We can hear the sea, not watch my young kids or my old parents walk by, as they can't access beach from our villas. About herathera stay:  2 of our villas did not have lights at the entrance and in the deck. We had to call the reception several times to get them fixed. There were no DVD players any of the villas as much as they were to be part of facilities. After sustained efforts we get 2 DVD players The service people do not change towels, shampoo, coffee machine items every day. You got to call. We did not carry tooth paste and the property does not have them. We had to wait till 9 am to go to the gift shop and shocked to find it takes one day to get them. The house keeping guys were to replace water bottles every day in villas, when we did not find them and called them, they insisted that they replaced it as per their records and Rudely transferred the phone to a bar where I can order water bottles.  I called 5 times and they did not supply water for 8 hours and every time they sounded I am lying. In essence the staff here has no idea of customer service. They behave as if we are staying here for free and almost make us feel we are at their mercy. Service, staff attitude is PATHETIC FOR LACK OF BETTER WORD. The experiences are endless. I will stop here. Summary: This whole experience has been horrible from the start. I don't think any of your Delhi staff cares for guests or what guests expect in terms of providing tickets . This is same with all guests  in this batch . I had to threaten them to get my refund for the difference of jacuzzi Beach villas vs Beach villas. We feel we have wasted our money and would never want to deal with maekmytrip.com who told us all lies when we booked our vacation. We are being forced to have a vacation at some one else's terms and not at ours. Over all a bad experience.",1
3178,"Extremely bad service. They are not at all flexible, overcharge over internet and direct bookings. You will be surprised at what is stated in their booking and the between the lines interpretation at the time of check in. They just have set up a web page and not taken any pain in building the back end or in ensuring customers get the correct ( forget low rates that are promised) . The customer service is horrible and they just send polite automated replies while you get frustrated dealing with them. I thought I was one of the few who was facing an issue but after seeing the number of complaints. I will be filing a complaint in the consumer court soon against makemytrip and I hope some of you join the same so that such fraudulent companies do not continue to operate on the internet.",1
3179,"Very good customer care & good rates tooI have booked twice through ""Make my Trip"" and have had good experience.  The customer care is really good. Also I get to book at good rates compared to other booking sites.I surely recommend this site to all the travelers travelling to and fro between India and US. Good Service and support.The website loading is good here in US. I dont know about Indian site because I have always booked from US.",4
3180,"The fares on their website keep on increasing during the day, and the next morning you find the fares are back to the lowest. Even though they mention that there are just few seats left, there are ample of seats available on their website the very next day! Also, the lowest fare advertised on their website is never available and you end up paying much higher price! I wanted to book a ticket to China which was showing INR31.5k, when I tried booking it there were no seats available for that amt. Later their customer called saying that the same airline is costing 46k and she is holding 1 seat for me for 34k. Later, when I confirmed for reservation, the cost I paid was INR39.5k! I agreed thinking believing the representative that there is only 1 seat left.... Just to find the next morning that the same airline was again costing 34k on their website! WHAT A WAY TO FOOL PEOPLE! Suggestion: Don't fall prey to their representatives mentioning that there are only few seats left.... always book online & not through representative. You might get better deals on yatra.com",1
3181,"I have booked many trips on MakeMyTrip, sometimes 4-5 a week. I still go back to it because they aggregate prices from all the airlines and it's easy. But their customer service is extremely lacking. One out of every three times I call to make a cancellation they tell me their system is down and to call back in a half hour. If I ask them if they can call me back they say no. In one instance I asked to speak to the manager and was flat-out told ""no"". The representative (by the name of Rohit) then proceeded to hang up on me when I asked for his employee ID number. In another instance my outbound flight was canceled by the airline and so the airline gave me a full refund. I needed to cancel the return flight (since I never made it there in the first place) and in addition to the airline cancellation fees MakeMyTrip insisted I should pay Rs. 250 as their cancellation fee. I explained to them that I was forced to cancel my trip because the outbound airline cancelled my flight and asked them for a courtesy as a frequent customer. I was simply explained the rules and told that I was cancelling by my choice even though I didn't really have a choice since I didn't make it to the city where I was supposed to catch my ""return"" flight from. Here is what I plan on doing in the future. I will use MakeMyTrip to find the cheapest fare and then I will go to the airline's website and buy it directly from them.",1
3182,"I had purchase two tickets for an international travel, one for myself and one for my son.I canceled one for my son yesterday. The charge was different. I called up makemytrip today to know my cancellation charges, I was told the same charges, but when I actually canceled, they charged me double to amount. To verify the charges, I called up airline, during cancellation with another phone, and they suggested  charging half the amount for cancellation of what makemytrip was charging me! I am never coming back to makemytrip again, I will suggest someone to book directly from the airline site instead. NEVER NEVER NEVER AGAIN!",1
3183,"Hi, If its possible I might give them 0 rating. I choose my make my trip first time in my life and face worst experience in my life. They will not update you on any policy during booking even till you pay all the money to them. After that they will start harassing you. Worst thing in my case is even Airlines force them to issue the ticket they didn't do that and I have pay money from my pocket to get it done.",1
3184,"I was going to India for my wedding. I was traveling to Atlanta with my wife few days after our wedding in India. I had booked a return ticket from Bengaluru to Atlanta via Frankfurt for myself and a one-way ticket for my wife who was traveling by air for the first time. Her ticket was booked with Makemytrip.com. During the busy wedding schedules and lack of connectivity I could not do a online check in. I din't know it was going to be my worst nightmare (and nothing can beat this one at that.) After lot of emotion filled good byes we proceeded towards checkin counter and I checked in my self and our luggage was taken in. Then while we were checking in my better half, Lufthansa official told that the ticket issued to her was a false ticket with a PNR number that had expired few months ago. While all this was going on my wife who was already under a great pressure started feeling dizzy. At night neither I can go back because I have checked in my luggage and have been issued a ticket. Then the person in the counter suggested I can buy a ticket for my wife on the spot if at all there is availability. After checking for 15 minutes I was told they can arrange for one ticket but at 1.5 times more price than what I had already paid for makemy trip. I tried calling makemytrip but couldn't reach them at that time. Time was running and I had to count all my resources so that I can get a ticket. Then I used my American debit card and thankfully got a ticket. On my arrival in Atlanta I called Makemytrip number of times and sent them the scanned copies of the tickets to recover only that part of money which they had charged me for the bogus ticket. I have filed a complaint with BBB for rest of the money I paid for the ticket.",1
3185,"We are an American family of four travelling in India and we used MakeMyTrip to book flights and hotels here. Though their website is easy to use, be warned, lease save yourself money and headache and do not use this company. They have the most blatantly ignorant customer service people I have ever had to deal with. They refuse to refund our money from one flight that we cancelled in person at the airport, with the permission of the manager, saying that we were no shows, even though we had actually checked into the flight and our bags had been checked! On another flight we had received our E-ticket with four confirmed names and Airline PNR numbers, only to be told when we checked in that MakeMyTrip had cancelled our daughter tickets without notifying us or issuing a refund. We had to pay for last minute tickets so our daughters would not be stranded in Mumbai. DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY!",1
3186,"We had booked a Hotel at coorg 10 days prior to the departure and full amount was debited from my account towards the confirmation. I get a call the night before the departure day that the hotel has been over booked and then can accommodate us at some other hotel and we need to confirm with in no time, as they were closing there operations for the day. Since we had no option, I called them back to confirm but it took 45 minutes to reach the customer care executive and she disconnects it promptly and again I tried reaching them. Luckily I got through with in 30 minutes this time and I get to hear from them that even this can't be confirmed now, since their operations team is closed for the day... I had to call them next day early morning as our travel was scheduled for that day... And somehow got it confirmed... The disaster begins as we reach the hotel? Home stay called Silver line. it was in the proper Madikere city and it was not worth more than 1k and we had paid 2.5k ( earlier we had booked a estate stay, since we wanted to stay away from city). Make my trip guys had lied to us that this hotel is better than what we booked, but this hotel guys itself confirmed to us that the room which we were staying was 1k per night. There was no T.V and No basic amenities. Our package was including the breakfast but the breakfast was not served. There was no water for both drinking and bathing. 6.Bed was terrible. Not only make trip cheated on us but also they misled us. And there was no feed back form available for the place we stayed (this is another important aspect) Please don't use MAKE MY TRIP ever in your life time! Thanks for your patience.",1
3187,"Had paid Makemytrip for a holiday 2 months in advance for a family trip to Rajasthan in Dec 2010. All the travel and accommodation was booked in advance by them and 100% payment collected. However, this is what happened when we actually went for the holiday: UDAIPUR JODHPUR Our second halt station was Jodhpur , and our stay was scheduled at Fort Khejarla, and being an outsider to Rajasthan we did not know its location. After travelling for about 300 kms from Udaipur to Khejarla we found the place being 85 kms away from Jodhpur and were almost 2 hours drive from main city, resulting we could not see anything in Jodhpur. On reaching the fort after travelling for 8 hours at about 1930 hours, we were offered room at Janana Mahal on two and half floor. The rooms did not have any leg space to move around the beds, with no room service, without basic provision of Electric kettle for making tea coffee etc. And was far away from the dining room at the ground floor. It meant that for all our foods we were to come to dining hall two and half storeys down. The area was giving a deserted feeling. They called them ROYAL CHAMBERS. On my refusal to accept these rooms, the front office staff insisted to give these rooms only as all the Royal Chambers at Ground Floor are occupied. After much deliberations, pursuance and showing annoyance, we were allotted rooms at ground floor(which were already vacant). Room no. 108 allotted to us was: a. Having short curtains on the door, which was overlooking the bed. b. Half Windows without curtains with transparent glass overlooking the bed. c. Gap in window curtains overlooking the bed. d. Washroom without door. e. Broken railing and faulty Jet on WC. I stayed in this room for one night out of my total stay of 2 nights there and next day at noon I was shifted to another room. We wanted to use the massage facility at the Spa, but nobody was there. On enquiry at the reception and after waiting for 2 hour, a fourth class male employee was called for massage of woman guests. We did not accept it and could not avail the facility. You can say the facility was not available there. On checking out at 0800 hours to proceed to Jaipur(our next halt), apart from other food bill(which we consumed during the stay) I was given 2 bills for Milk consumed at the breakfast. Our booking was inclusive of free breakfast, but the Front Office Assistant said milk is not included in free breakfast. We were made to pay for these bills. JAIPUR On the way to Jaipur, I recd a call on my mobile by Mr Himanshu from make my trip that there is a mandatory entry fee of Rs 3500 per guest for Gala new year DINNER at Country Inn hotel, (where our stay was scheduled). As I was on roaming, I postponed the talk and asked him to talk after we check in. This so called mandatory fee was neither mentioned while booking this trip, nor mentioned in the hotel voucher issued to me. It is pertinent to note here that I booked this trip in first week of October 2010, i.e. about 80 days prior to start of trip, but never during this period this MANDATORY sum payable was ever asked or mentioned to me. They kept on insisting and on my refusal to accept this offer, they came down to pay half the sum of it. They kept on calling me on my mobile, knowing very well that I am on roaming and their demand is not genuine. After my strong retaliation they stopped calling me. It spoiled our holiday mood, and our co guests were very uncomfortable and annoyed by the behaviour and services of MAKEMYTRIP. JOURNEY BACK In shivering cold we reached Jaipur airport at 0630 hours, and were informed that this flight had been withdrawn since 2 months. Neither Makemytrip nor Air India informed us about cancellation of this flight and our money was never refunded. Air India officials arranged a taxi for us for our journey from Jaipur to Delhi, in lieu of our flight booking. As our further programme was fixed we had no choice but to accept their arrangement.",1
3188,"Booked 4 tickets Mumbai-Bangkok-Mumbai through MAKE MY TRIP.COM, travel dates 17th and 22nd Dec. One of us had to travel back on the 19th due to an emergency. On 20th early morning, informed MakeMyTrip to cancel 1 ticket, which was acknowledged and done very promptly. However, when processing the refund, no reply from them until a reminder was sent on 4th, to which they replied that no refund could be paid as the ticket was cancelled after the travel date, which is not correct. Pointed out to them the the travel date was the 22nd, and the cancellation was done on the 20th, which was acknowledged by them on the 20th. Yet they now state that they will not pay a refund! DO NOT BOOK ANY TICKETS ON MAKE MY TRIP, unless you are 100% certain that you will not cancel, as they obviously try to avoid paying any refunds. And to think that I always choose to pay a little extra and book refundable tickets! Now I know there is no difference, at least with MakeMyTrip.com.",1
3189,"I had booked a holiday for my family for dates 24th, 25th, 26th on Dec 15 in a resort called Windflower Spa and Resort in Mysore. I immediately got a confirmation email that my booking is confirmed and I need not check with the hotel. When I reached there on 24th (traveled 300 kms), the receptionist told me that there is no booking in my name! I was shocked and felt like an idiot in front of my family. The manager told me that this is the 10th such case in this week. I got so enraged that I have created a separate site documenting my experience (and helping others share theirs) at https://ruinedmytrip.com. I'm going to do all that I can to get this site on the top of search engine results when people search for ""Make My Trip"" This way everybody will know what these crooks are up to. I sincerely request people who have had similar experiences to share their experiences on my site too. They cannot get away by simply saying sorry and giving a refund. Together we can do it!",1
3190,"MakeMyTrip is as useful as a local tout/rikshawala/taxi-wala could be – their modus operendi is same – take a cut (commission) in the hotel rent – show up all the hotels are on their list, have got rooms – even when they have none. It is sheer chance that one can get a hotel through this site – otherwise be prepared for a shock on reaching your destination, for long phone calls, for numerous e-mails and wait for your refund. My misadventure with this tout company started when I had to go to Lucknow with family. I booked a hotel called as “Shimla Palace” from their website for which I paid through my credit-card. After a visibly successful booking, I got confirmation mails and even an assurance cum congratulation call before I reached in that hotel. In “Shimla Palace” a shock was awaiting for me – this hotel told me that they don’t have any ties with MakeMyTrip, so the booking is invalid. And that there was no space available (as shown on MakeMyTrip site), so they can’t accommodate me. I had to call MakeMyTrip. Their teams have idea of whether a space is available in some hotel or not and operate in a manner similar to Local Rikshawalahs – except that fact that these do speak English. Now all the good and smooth talking disappeared. The first lady I talked to – asked me to wait and after holding me for some 10 minutes, disconnected the call. She even told to resolve the matter there itself, to call up MakeMyTrip’s local representative (who told me that no place is available in some other hotel which has got tie-up with MakeMyTrip). I called repeatedly at the number given to me, but its system indicated that all numbers were busy. Meanwhile nobody from this company even bothered to call me up although I had already requested you for help. Later on when I called to cancel the booking and to complaint, the call center executive suggested me to hire an advocate for grievance redressal – told me that he is the senior most authority in “Make My Trip” and he could not do anything. Although he did promise for some compensation above refund, but it has not appeared into the refund mail they have sent. Instead of relaxing with family on holidays, I had to spend first day in finding a place to stay that too with a 2 year kid – it could never had been worse. Due to their cheating – a typical tout like behaviour, I had to travel all over the city to find a hotel. The sole reason I chose to take the services of ""Make my trip"" was to eliminate any kind of uncertainty while traveling with my family – in a same way one buys a railway ticket in advance. I did not want to depend upon the local agents/Autowalahs/touts, wanted to have an assured staying arrangement in Lucknow, wanted to avail the published facility on published rates - for which I did pay in advance to this company - for the sake of peace of mind, so that I could attend to my family. However due to this cheating on their part I was deprived of this. These guys do make tall promises, but, I am sorry to say that, they are good for nothing – I am totally disappointed with MakeMyTrip services, and will advise readers to try their luck with competitors for better service.",1
3191,"Recently went on a holiday to kerla. iteneary was changed over thrice from the main itneary on the website. it was not received by me on time and we left without a final itenary in our hands. The agent assigned for cab services  had probably sub letted it to another agent who again was sub-letting the job to different cab drivers. it was too chaotic with new drivers and new cars and waiting period was beyond our patience level. communication was a huge problem. the india cars were so bad,  was so slow on the hills, already had covered a distance of 1lac 75 thousand kms. on the way to tekkady AC was not working. it was hot after we left Munar. on our way to allepy from tekkady the car again was slow. driver did not have money to fill diesel as the agent had not given him any money nor he knew how many days he was supposed to be with us. we gave him Rs.1000 for food and diesel. the agent returned us the money after our stay at house boat and some 25calls we made to him. in 10 days our cars were changed 8 times with a new driver almost everyday causing immense dalays in sightseeing etc. drivers did not know timings of places of visit and most of them used to be closed when we went their. we were promised 24hrs car as it was a customised tour but our drivers were used in the evenings for some other passenger pick and drop services. we never got out in the evenings for shopping or dinners.everyday we were promised good car and a driver who understood english or hindi and did not get it till the end. complaints made to the website fell on deaf years and their executive never picked up our calls and did not reply to our messages. we received out of office replies from their executives. hotels were not up to the mark. promising 3 star hotels we were left with cheap sub standard hotels at cochin, munnar (hotel had a 9 item handwritten menu on a rough paper), kumarkoam were so cheap that we felt disgusted. their rooms were filthy, their tarrifs were Rs.2500 per night even in the peak season. no 3 star facilities were available. old furniture old tv sets were the highlight of the package. i have mailed them for a compensation and explanation for the poor services provided but again have received out of office replies. below is my complaint to the website and their reply in which they promise to get back to me with the answers but am still waiting. 02/12/2010 04.03 PMi have not received final itenary despite requesting it 100 times. no reply to emails and phone calls . sanjiv mandal send an auto reply after 2 days of me repeatedly emailing him. he has made changes to the itenary that is on your website and we have not yet received it. he was in touch till the time vouchers were sent. he has not been picking up my calls and replying to emails since last 2 days. no one else has responded from his behalf if he was out of office. I request better services from your side. please check me emails to sanjiv mandal (extn 3569) from last 3 days.

3192,This is the first time in my life that I have had such a bad experience while booking online. I tried to book my air ticket thru makemytrip.com . While booking there was a transaction error. In spite of this my Credit Card Account was charged 750 Dollars (Ticket Cost ) . This is insane. I tried following up with Customer Care and they does not seem to Care about this problem with their website and I am still in the process of getting my money back ( God knows when I will get my refund) My Suggestion ->  Stay Away from this site if you don't want to get your money blocked.,1
3193,"I normally use travelguru for my hotel bookings but decided on makemytrip for a change. They booked an expensive hotel for me in Pondicherry and sent a confirmation saying that ""you don;t need to confirm with hotel or us"".  To my surprise, when I drover 300kms to the place with children, I was told that there is no confirmed booking for me. I called makemytrip and initially they said that it is a confirmed booking but later someone called to apologize and said ""these things do happen once in a while !!""  Amazing......... Looks like they never got a confirmation but went ahead and booked form me. They offered to refund the money (and I can drive back) or offer an alternative lousy resort nearby which had bad reviews.   Finally the hotel agreed to accommodate me in a room where AC was not working and we had a bad night - thanks to makemytrip. I have booked more than a dozen times on travelguru and only once there was some minor hitch but they called the hotel and sorted it out.  The makemytrip experience was horrifying and I will not recommend the site to anyone for hotels at least.",1
3194,"This is Sandeep, I would like to share my experience I had with MakeMyTrip.com. I tried booking ticket from bangalore to delhi on 29th nov 2010 through makemytrip.com, which didn't get confirmed due to some technical reasons and my money got debited form the account which was Rs 21000. I received a mail from makemytrip and they promised to return money with in 2 working days. Again on next day I tried booking the same trip and same thing got repeated and again Rs21000 got debited. Again I received a mail from makemytrip saying your money will be refunded back in 2 days. I was in the impression that I will get Rs42000 so I waited for 3 days but still nothing happened . I gave a call to customer care and they logged the complaint and promised me that I will get my money is 7 working days, again I waited for 7 days but nothing happened. This kept going on and I was continuously following it up. I called them 10 times and every time some customer care executive used to pick up the call and say ""sir wait for 7 days"". Even I mailed them that I will log a case in consumer court  but still there was no special attention.After 15 days for one transaction they refunded me partial amount and  again I logged complaint for the remaining. After struggling for 25 days by following up with makemytrip and even bank I got my money back. My experience with makemytrip was so pathetic that I can't even dream of booking the ticket again from makemytrip. So it is my advice that please think twice before booking ticket through makemytrip.",1
3195,"I along with my wife took the exotic Andaman trip from Dec 12to 19th from Bangalore. The trip was good initially, but the organizers at Port blair and Havelock were nuts and were just not able to manage the show. They didn't have a clear plan of what they were doing and they made us wait for at least 20-30 mins before boarding a bus or a ferry. We stayed in Sea shell hotel and I would never stay in this hotel next time. These money suckers are just behind you to make business out of everything. They didn't even allow us to have our own drinks despite being no regulation or law banning to have alcohol. They also didn't allow us to have a group party just because we didn't buy lunch and drinks from them....very cheap on them.",1
3196,"I and my wife had an amazing honeymoon in Mauritius, thanks to MakemyTrip for the arrangements. Right from the point we stepped into the Bangalore airport until the time we landed back in Bangalore, we had absolutely no problems and the arrangements were taken care well by Make my Trip. The beach resort Jalsa Beach was a beautiful place, perfect for a honeymoon and we had timely support from people for the checkin and the tours too. The contact persons from Make My Trip are really very courteous and understanding people, who do not hesitate to help in case any clarifications are required or in case you have any problems. I would any day, without any hesitation book my holidays through Make My Trip to enjoy a worry-free vacation.",4
3197,"I took worst decision in my life to go on holidays to kerala with Make My Trip. The name of the packaged tour was ""Enchanting Kerala"" from 12th Nov to 18th Nov 2010. In website it appears to be professional services but it’s nowhere seen in entire trip. The website provides exciting hotels( 3 Star) with huge disclaimer ""This hotel or similar hotel"". Unfortunately we always got so called ""Similar"" in makemytrip term. It will be joke to call tekkady hotel( Thrisangu haven hotel) a 3-star hotel. Not sure if it can be in any star category as not sure if ""Dharma Shalas"" has any ratings. Cleanliness is at scarcity in this hotel. Not sure why makemytrip provides such hotel to humiliate its customers. Makemytrip provided bus with no pushback and leg space. No space for luggage( Except rooftop). I hope makemytrip understands that people are here to enjoy their vacation and not to trouble themselves. Hotel in kochi(Emerald) has been other nightmare. Run for buckets of hot water, fight for breakfast will be unforgettable events. Hotel is simply understaffed and not fully equipped as on date to service these many people. I am hoping over next few months these problems with kochi hotel shall get resolved. Makemytrip simply outsourced entire trip to local tour operator in Kerala. For every issue, person from local tour operator kept on saying that he got this contract from makemytrip only 20 days back. Although everyone on this tour booked 2 months back.  There has been lot of confusion on accountability of entire mess. The response on phone from makemytrip was also not encouraging. I hope makemytrip takes lessons from this and improve on things and make really good holidays.",1

3200,"I would like to give a very sincere and honest advice to all prospective travelers: please don't ruin your trip with make my trip.com. if u really want to screw yourself , there are better ways of doing it. I was utterly disappointed with the sheer apathy shown by makemy trip.com towards the conduct of the so called 'Enchanting kerala package' from 12 nov to 18 nov 2010. It was a guided tour but without any 'guide' as makemytrip believes in self-guidance.further, hotels mentioned in the itinery as 3-star bore resemblance to 'B - grade dharamshalas'  in actuals. the sight seeing and visits were dull and the entire lot of us were made to pay for each and everything.you won't believe that  we paid Rs 100 each just to see how spices are grown in kerala. I have not exaggerated a bit in this review and my co travelers or shall I call co-sufferers  will agree in to and may add more grievances. Pl don't travel with 'make my trip.com'.",1
3201,"We booked makemytrip vacation package from Banglaore to Portblair (Cost per person is 35000/-INR (nov1- Nov-7th 2010). We faced lot of challenges with the makemytrip and I do not recommend this to others. I sprained my ankle during the trip and MakeMyTrip exhibited very cheap and inhuman behaviour .Pasting snippet from the long description below More details below.. 1) I spoke to MakeMyTrip Executive over phone on OCT-26th to enquire about MakeMyTrip Andaman Package from Bangalore. The Travel specialist hiked the price from 27, 999 INR displayed in the website to 34, 999 INR per person as this is festive season. I booked the tickets and my creditcard was charged 70, 000 INR. I was informed that itenary will be sent shortly. All I know is that departing date is on OCT-31st from Bangalore and no confirmation is received on email / SMS 2) I did not receive the itenary on Wed, OCT-27th. I called up MakeMyTrip 3-4 times for itenary and flight details. Each time I call them, they ask my name, phone number and put me on hold in each dept for 10 min..To reach the right dept , I will have to tell my name and mobile number 4-5 times and wait for 45 min to talk to the right person. After a long wait, I was informed that the person who booked my tickets is on vacation and so is the delay in sending me the tickets/iternary 3) same situation on Thu too. I did not receive booking confirmation. I was concerned that 70, 000/-INR was charged on my card, but no email was received. I called MakeMyTrip folks 3 times and the response was the same ( Concerned person was on vacation) 4) Same response with long wait on Friday too OCT-29 too. 5) On saturday OCT_30th , I did not receive any confirmation/email from MMT. I packed my baggage too, but dont know when to book my cab to airport as I am not aware of the flight details. Was on phone trying to reach MMT customer care for 3-4 hours ..was totally frustated calling them multiple times..All I hear from them is "" pls be on hold, I will transfer the call to concerned dept""... Finally I gaveup and asked my husband to keep calling MMT for itenary details..Finally we got the response that the itenary is sent to my email..I checked my emails with lot of enthu, , but havnt recved the email .Again called-up MMT with another 30 min on hold and this time we asked the MMT guy to be on the call until the email is in the inbox...Atlast we have the itenary on hand... 6) we reached the airport and then at the check-in counter , our names were missing. This is MMT charter (KingFisher RED) from Blore to PortBlair) We were standing at the check-in counter with lot of anxiety and MMT manager finally resolved the issue after 30 min wait at the check-in counter in the Blore airport.. 7) Reached PortBlair..The accomodation/food was decent.. 8) During sight-seeing , I slipped and sprained my ankle..we rushed to the near by hospital and found that it is a sprain..and need to take rest for few days..I was very disappointed with this incident and also was not able to walk/stand with out any support. 9) we spoke to MMT person to update about the sprain and also informed him that we will not be able to join them for Havelock sightseeing for the next 3 days as I was on bedrest. 10) To my surprise, they asked us to vacate the room next morning...shouted at us with inhuman words when we questioned them...I thought they would show lot of concern as we were tourists in Portblair..MMT folks are VERY INHUMAN...THey only mentioend that "" room is blocked until tomorrow morning..If you want to continue your stay ..you negotiate and pay..We are not sure if rooms are available here..We cannot do much.This is your health problem.we are not involved , so you should pay all the extra cost yourself"" I asked him if they are going return the paid money for Havelock 3 days trip and MMT manager said he cannot as it is already paid to the hotel in Havelock. Why should we pay for the existing accomodation in Portblair(becoz we want to extend the stay) and also for the Havelock accomodation too ( becoz we are not joining)? And I was not even in a position to stand..How the hell will I shift the room...I was already in deep pain and all these discussions were more frustating then my pain the in the ankle..MakeMyTrip manager asked us to shift to another hotel on our own..No help was offered..Why do we need such tour operators? The very reason why we book with them is to organize the tour and offer help in case of need. They literally pushed us onto the roads by forcing us to vacate the room..infact MMT did not even try to negotiate with the hotel management if there are any extra rooms available..Fortunately the hotel manager showed some sympathy and gave us a room in the same hotel.As the hotel mangement is same for hotel in portblair and Havelock, he also informed that the room charges werer not paid for us in Havelock..Is MakeMytrip doing business at the cost of my health?.Pathetic behaviour from MMT manager..When I told the MMT manager that I will lodge a complaint, he asked us to goahead and do it..VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING and FRUSTATING 11) I was able to walk in 3 days . MMT cancelled all the localsightseeing due to heavy rains in PortBlair, but they have included all the sightseeing in the package. When the members in the group asked to return the money, MMT manager said that ""it is because of unforeseen weather we cannot take you out for sightseeing and also cannot return the money""..How did the same MMT manager say that ""If is your health problem ..You fell down and sprained your ankle..we cannot do much..you will have to pay at both porblair and Havelock accomodation..is this not unforeseen situation?

3202,"I booked my family tickets from US to India via these guys. I want to use choicest swear words on them but at least my ethics do not allow to use them - why ? they are very deceptive and cheaters. a) they do not honor the price they show on their own website -forget price match guarantee b) I gave details about 4 adults and a child ticket. The buggers charged me an adult ticket for a child ticket without even explicitly telling me that. c) when I realized the mistake and call them, they say they will refund the difference. Does not tell me how much refund I will get on his own. When I press hard for 10 minutes, he comes up with a pittance 7-8% of the adult fare. Every one knows that child fare is 75% of base fare + taxes (that's what they quote on their web site as well). d) when I do not agree and ask for cancellation he says he will charge $50 per ticket; when asked earlier; the avoidance fee was $15-20. e) btwn the two evil choices of $200 down the drain or taking a loss on child fare, I go with them with tickets. He says the pittance refund on child fare will be in account in 15-20 days; more than a month now nothing !! f) when I call them now, they say they have already sent the refund. When I ask for proof (when, how much, some document to establish they refunded) cheater say they cannot that info !!!",1
3203,We recently went on a tour 4days/5night tour to Bangkok and Pattaya. Initially I was bit apprehensive after reading various reviews about MMT. But contrary to by belief the tour was organized very well my MMT. We had a local tour guide and Indian Tour director. They were very helpful. We were promised accommodation in 5 Star hotels and they met it. We were provided Indian food and it was very nice. They showed all the locations as mentioned in the package. We were picked up and dropped back at the Bangkok airport. The overall package cost considering the facilities was very reasonable. The only issue I faced was that the tickets and hotel booking was give to us 2 days before the departure. Overall a good experience and I would use their services again in future and I would recommend MMT to others based on my experience.,4
3204,"Ruined my life. I lost Rs 28, 000 because of their mistake! They booked the wrong ticket for me and to my horror at the airport I was not allowed to board the plane.It was my first time travelling as an international student and they casued me SO MUCH OF grief.Since their ticket could not be used, I HAD TO BUY ANOTHER TICKET of 58, 000 rupees which had a stop over and then I HAD TO BUY A SECOND ticket for 10, 000.totally, i lost Rs. 28, 000(more than what I paid MAKEMYTRIP)because of their mistake.The refunded only part of my original amount.and the new tickets I had to buy at Sahar airport on the spot cost me much more than the original ticket .I reached abroad with only 200 dollars left in my pocket",1
3205,"FOR ALL THAT ARE READING, AND FORWARD THIS TO ALL YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS. MAKE MY TRIP IS A TOTAL AND COMPLETE FRAUD. My entire family and I (48 members) are going to India this December for a large wedding. We made our arrangements in July of this year since Dec is peak traveleing season. Most of us used a local travel agent as we have in the past and made our booking. My daughter was traveling from another state so I went to makemytrip.com THAT IS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE. We booked a flight with Saudi Arabian airlines for a total fare of $1423.00. A couple of months later, my daughter went to the airline website to check on seat arrangements only to find out the flights had been canceled. Immediately, (Sept 20, 2010) we called make my trip and that is when the downhill spiral began. Between Sept 30, 2010 and today Oct 20, 2010, we have made 14 calls to make my trip and have gotten nothing but incredible run around and lies. Every time they tell us they will call us back in 24-48 hours and never once have I received a call. When you ask for a supervisor, the excuses range from there are no supervisors on staff (what am I stupid), or they are on break or can I call back in 5 min, 2 hours, 3 hours. I do call back just to be told that they are not available. On the two rare occassions, I spoke to a supevisor (so they say) named Bhupinder that assured me a return call within 24 hours, 72 hours pass and no call so I called back. I tried again for a supervisor and was given same set of excuses, but this time, I said I would hold the line for however long it too, and magically the supervisor came on the phone 10 minutes later (Vharam), who now promised me a call back within 30 minutes. Folks, its been three days and still no call back. I told makemytrip that they failed to notify us that the flight had been canceled, When we spoke to Saudi Airlines they told us that they informed Makemytrip at the beginning of September. Makemy trip states there were going to call but we beat them to it. I find it hard to believe. I have spoken to other travel agents since then and they are informed immediately of flight changes and they inform their clients right away. Finally today, Makemytrip says they cannot find me any other replacement flight. This I am not surrpised about, that is why I booked in July to begin with. They told me they would now refund the fare after 20 days!!! Our trip is less than two months away and I can't get a booking anymore for my daughter and her roommate, and if I can, the fare is $2500 not the $1423 that I paid for planning ahead. Makemytrip does not stand by its own terms and agreements and also are liars (proven by feedback I received from Saudi Airlines). The customer is the worst I have ever experienced in my life. This is not a theat, Make my trip has messed with the wrong person. I will report them to the better business bureau, take out a full page ad in the Indian newspaper and file a complaint with the NY attorney general's office. They cannot treat people like this and get away with it. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE, YOU WILL BE SORRY IF YOU DO. THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER SITES, DO YOU HOMEWORK AND READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE HAND. IF SOMEONE OUT THERE HAS DEEP KALRA'S EMAIL PLEASE PROVIDE IT AND ALSO IF YOU HAVE REPORTED THIS COMPANY TO ANY OTHER AGENCY I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW. THANKS.",1

3207,"This is my first ever review of such kind and what promoted me to take this step is to help those to fall in the ditch that I just recovered from. I booked a 9nights/10days package in kerala from MakeMyTrip.com (Booking id: INW1009B00058) and the holiday was planned in late september'2010. The hotels mentioned to us were 3stars or similar, but trust me ppl, apart from one in Thekkady, all the hotels were not more than 2 star hotels, not to mention the pathetic and horrifying stay in the JCT houseboat. It was all bullshit that I even wanted to cancel the trip mid-way and I conveyed this to MakeMyTrip.com and as we all know, the first thing they say is there will be no refund of money paid, so had to continue our horrifying experience for few more days. The taxi provided to us was also below standard and driver was not so proficient in communicating in english. after returning from the trip, I even registered a complaint with MakeMyTrip.com and the reference id of the compaint is 100930-038800. But got a reply from them saying they will take care in future. I mean WTF. I would strictly suggest you guys to avoid using packages from such travel agents. although MakeMyTrip.com is old and well known travel advisor, but I would never ever go for any future packages from them. STRICT NO. i would request all dear ones not to take such packages and avoid horrifying experience that somehow I couldn't.

Also to my suprise that even though I was charged there is no booking for my flight and makemy trip claims they will send the booking itenary in 4 hrs but it has not reached me yet. Also been told that will get a call back in 2 hrs but it has been 10 hrs still no call back. All I wanted was to cancel and some one would tell me what is the total refund before cancel, this has turned into a sadistic nightmare with makemy trip being a first experience.

The staff is so un professional, I had spoken to more than 20 people in this bull sh*t company like, jagjit singh, Bala ji Bala, Veerpaul Kaur, Nagesh, Ashish, Anika etc etc, Jagjit singh misbehaved like a junglee. They charged my credit card instantly for a fake booking generated by this makemytrip, com portal and after arguing 20 people of this cheating company, they promised to gave me a refund after 7 business days. I am waiting for the refund and will definitely going to sue this Deepak Kalra so called CEO of this company.",1

They had provided the accommodation in some of the best hotels/resort and the food was great in all the hotels. It was a complete value for money as they also provided childe-free offer (book the package for parents, take one child absolutely free). There were no other hidden costs anywhere and they were very transparent in their dealing. They even considered our request to prepone the trip dates. Overall, it was a memorable trip and we enjoyed every bit of Andaman trip. We are already looking for our next trip with Make-my-trip.",4
3211,"I am writing this review to share my experience about my ongoing harassment with MakeMyTrip refund department. It has now been close to 2 months that I am following up on my refund status through phone (I am in the US) and through email but I have been hearing the same reply that I will be contacted back within 24 hours which has not happened even once. This company is full of crooks who are very quick when you do a booking but they all sleep and are eager to just take your money and don't refund it at the time of cancellation.For your information, my booking ID is NN251931310606 to verify that I am a legitimate sufferer. Below are the experiences in detail: I had booked my tickets through MakeMyTrip from Delhi to Cincinnati and the option I got was via Toronto. I was never told or got any message that I need a transit visa to travel through Canada. I came to know about this when I went to the airport to board my flight. When I called them from the airport they plainly said that they do not share that information. I was with my wife and 9 month old daughter stranded at the airport and 1:00 AM in the night just because MakeMyTrip did not think it was important enough to let the passengers know about these details. Anyways the FUN doesn't end here.... I cancelled the ticket and booked another one. I have been following up with them ever since for the refund but nothing has happened. They said that I will only get the taxes back and the base fare will not be refunded. I had to call up the airlines myself to confirm this and they said that MakeMyTrip did not file for any base fare refund and I am entitled for the base fare refund (which is more than INR 1.5 lakhs). I had to let MakeMyTrip know about the same and they said that they will process that. I called them up after around 2-3 weeks to follow up again and they said that the airlines hasn't processed the refund yet. When I asked the airlines, they said they haven't received any request from MakeMyTrip. I am now overdue to make a payment to my credit card company and I don't know yet when is my refund going to happen (if it happens at all).I just finished another call with a customer representative who had promised me that I will get a reply within 24 hours :)) ... Will keep all of the interested parties posted about the status. PS: Do let me know if anyone has the email ids of Deep Kalra. I got one deep@makemytrip.com and I am forwarding this script to him too.",1
3212,"I booked tickets for my wife and son through make my trip and am going through a living hell for that mistake. When booking ticket the agent indicated that my son will be confirmed a bassinet within 24 hours of ticket confirmation and that I will be sent a e-ticket. Four days later I had to call customer service as there was no sign of e-ticket and they sent me a e-ticket and for bassinet they said I had to call the airline. When I called airline they said their policy only allows bassinet for <10 months and my son is 11 months so they wont give me a bassinet. Being a travel agent who book tickets every minute, I would assume they know the airline policies. They charged me thrice for the ticket and when I call the 1-800 number all they say is we see only one charge. When I ask for refund they make me send the screen shots of the charge. I took the easier route and called the bank and asked them to take care of them for me.My experience with these guys has been worst, and I would ask everyone who plan to book through them to STAY AWAY.",1
3213,"I read many reviews onmouthshut.comfor makemytrip.com. Most of the reviewers did not recommend using makemytrip.com to book flight tickets. Fortunately, I had a good experience dealing with makemytrip.com. I booked a return ticket from the US site for my cousin who visited us last month. They gave me the cheapest available deal  on the internet. It was a British airways flight from New Delhi, India to Washington, USA  via London, UK. The flight hunting process: I browsed through several travel websites to find the best deal and finally zeroed in on makemytrip.com. Searching the flight was quite easy. I just had to enter the origin and destination city. Within seconds I got a list of all flights operating in the Delhi- Washington sector. There were several options to choose from. Some were 1 stop flights while others were 2 stop flights and slightly cheaper. I opted for the one stop flight because it had less lay over time. The booking process: The booking process was hassle free and the user friendliness of the website helped me purchase the ticket in no time. I paid online from my credit card and immediately got a confirmation number on my email. The whole process of paying online was quite convenient. Receiving the electronic ticket: According to the confirmation email, the e-ticket is usually sent on email within 72 hrs after receiving the payment confirmation email. I received my e-ticket after about 48 hrs! The e-ticket had all the information about the time, date, flight no. and Airport terminal details. It also had an online access code that I could enter on makemytrip.com to check, manage and track any changes in my travel itenary. Makemytip.com does charge a cancellation fee and clearly state that during the booking process for our information. Confirming the booking: It is necessary to confirm booking 72 hrs prior to the date of departure. I could not do it online so I called up the customer support toll-free number. It took a while before I could speak to the customer support representative. The representative was quite polite and asked for my booking no. Within a few seconds, I was told that my ticket was already confirmed and everything is well. I also asked if I can book the seats online. She told me that I can go to British Airways website and lock the desired seats by using the same booking number! I was very pleased to receive positive information from the representative. I had emailed my cousin the air ticket and according him he had no problem whatsoever at the airports with regards to the printouts of the e-ticket.  The flight was pleasant and comfortable. Overall, I am quite satisfied with the services offered at makemytrip.com. The only flaw was the regular fluctuation of ticket prices. The customer service was great and so was the booking and confirmation process. I am not by any chance an agent of makemytrip.com and this review was based solely on facts and my personal experience. Please do provide your valuable feedback.",4
3214,"Makemytrip only believes in selling tickets. God forbid there may be a problem with your ticket due to any schedule changes or anything at all, do not expect any help from them. They will tell you that they are working on your issue when really they are doing nothing! It will be you calling them constantly, to hear the same reply over and over again. ""We are working on it and will get back to you within 24 hours"", and they never get back! Any offers and promotions they advertise, they do not believe in fulfilling what they say. I had to threaten them with legal action before they finally responded with the free domestic tickets that I was to receive with my international return ticket.  They will also keep hanging up on you when they can;t resolve your issues. SO, UNLESS YOU ARE SURE SURE SURE that you will not be making changes to your itinerary or your airline will be nice enough to accommodate you elsewhere, DO NOT GO TO MAKEMYTRIP.I will rather pay $100 extra for a ticket elsewhere, then go to MAKEMYTRIP again and be harassed.",1

Make my Trip. com allowed us to view our itinerary and even go ahead and make our payment by credit card and then it said that our payment was charged but the tickets could not be issued. I called the number listed on their website and they agents told me this is very common and I would be refunded my $6700 after 7 business days. This is a BIG SCAM.

3216,"   I did the biggest mistake of my life the day I choose to book my tickets on Make my trip. It started when I decided to make a trip to Goa and wanted to book a return air ticket for 2. When I went on Chat with the executive she promised a call back which never happened. I was in need of the so make the mistake of going again on the Chat and had a chat with a female names Sajeda. She was a sweet tooth. got kept following up with me for 3 days claiming every day that the flights rates have gone up. For continuously 3 days the prices were increasing by around 800 bugs.    So we decided to finally make a call and freeze the same. In between all our calls were attended and all the emails were responded too. So finally my husband and I made up our minds and paid the amount of Rs. 10830/- on IVR and the agent congratulated us for getting the awesome rates. Booking Id - NF25145429115. God struck me with his stick and I immediately went online to check the rates on other site. with the intention of checking out how much money I have saved.    Here to my suprized the same company and timings fligts were charging 1100 less. Within an hour I called up and reported the matter. Got the justification that prices keeps changing. All this while prices were increasing and immediately after I booked it the prices reduced down how suprizising. I really wonder . was the aviation really waiting for me to book the tickets before slashing the prices. I demanded for the balance amt to be refunded to me / cancel the entire transaction and I will book somewhere else. Well the agent agreed for cancellation but informed that there will be 1000 bugs cancellation charges for each ticket. Wht the F**K. first they loot you and then loot you further in the name of cancellation charges. I surely deserve this punishment for selecting this shitty online site.    After wasting half a day on calls+ 4-5 emails. they finally agreed for refunding the amount of Rs. 1000/- verbally. then there was again no communication from their end. again a follow up and got a confirmation from their TL Dhaval on 25th Aug stating that they have processed the refund request and the amt will be refunded in max 8-10 days. After this day whenever I call up Ms. Sajeda is suprizingly not available to attend the call. Mr. Dhaval is busy on the floor. Ms. Badal( receptionist I think) is the one who answers the call and assure you that the amount will be refunded. On each call I get a new reference number, I am amused how they manage to bluf a customer so much.    Again a follow up process is on. In between I went to the trip and even came back from there. When called up their customer support. got a confirmation that the amount is already refunded on 21st September . but they dont know whether the amt is refunded in my card / my bank account. they dont have any system to track the refund. how successfully they manage to grab your money but for reversing it there is lack of systems. Again wasted an entire hour at 12.00 in the night talking to their customer service and finally got a email confirmation stating the amt is refunded but for confirmation I will receive a call in 24 hours. The time of the email is 23/09/2010 12.08 AM.    Its more than 24 hours and I am still waiting for a call. till date there is no courtesy call from their end. they calls I received was to grab the money before purchasing the tickets. the mental trauma and frustration these guyz have given me is far more than the Rs., 1100 which they are yet to refund.they dont care for the customer post the amt is refunded. I wont be suprized if my money is never refunded to me.    The purpose of writing this complaint is to save as many people as possible from a chor company named makemytrip.com. well indeed what a trip and interaction this has become.

3217,"As the title tells a lot about my idea about this website, getting refunds from this private organisation is impossible. Case: Rail ticket partially cancelled( i.e. 1 out of 5 tickets cancelled after reservation.) Cancellation Date: 25.08.2010 Refund expected date: 1.09.2010 Today: 15.09.2010. The amount is INR 323, and for today's case it's termed meager... However, such a case cannot be ignored by a person like me as its not the case of being stingy, but its about how honest the company is to me. Communication: 03.09.2010 : Called makemytrip and was told that it would take 48 hours more. 05.09.2010:  Called again and was told to send my bank statement (i.e. from 25.08.2010-  05.09.2010). Still 48 hours more. 07.09.2010: Called again. Was asked to wait for 48 hours more. Though on website it showed ""refund complete"" dated 6.09.2010. 10.09.2010: Called again. Was told that my case has been forwarded to accounts dept. Would take 48 hours more. Was assured my giving me a ref ID. 13.09.2010: Called again. Was told that it would take 48 hours more. 15.09.2010: Called again today. Was told to send my bank statement again. 48 hours more. This time I asked that whether I would be contacted or I would have to contact again. From the above dated points, I am stressing about the number of calls I have already made to get my 'meagre' amount of  INR 323. Also, everytime I call, I am questioned in every other way possible as if I am calling for the first time. Is the company telling me, silently, to forget my INR 323 ??? The question is not about the amount but the integrity of this company. Is this the way, one has to wait for one's own refund??? I never had such bad, miserable and pathetic customer services offered ever...and would also want people to know about the same. Would really want you all  to contribute by commenting on the same. - Raviraj Suvarna.",1
3218,"I was originally booked with the PNR RQR6N7. The flight IC 180 was 'cancelled' and I was rescheduled to fly on 21st August instead of 20th August. I was not informed. 'Makemytrip' also did not inform me. I found the rescheduling on my own and cancelled the booking. I made a new booking with PNR RAS6I5, this was for 20th August, flight IC 180. Why was I made to cancel and re-book when the flight IC 180 was not cancelled? I am filing complaint with the consumer forum. These Makemytrip were selling the tickets for the flight and at the same time were telling me that it has been cancelled 'sorry sir'. What will I do with their 'sorry'? Did I pay with 'sorry' when I bought the tickets? Will they take their 'sorry' next time I buy ticket with them? Just passing on airline info without any checks on their side. They tell me they have sent sms to my mobile, it is a Netherlands number, not delivered. Do they check? They send me rescheduling mail, repeating same details as original booking, very confusing people. On top of this they cancelled with 200/- service charge, what service I do not know.",1
3219,"I have done atleast 8 bookings through makemytrip - for hotel, flight and rail - what I realize now is that the Process does not end after we make bookings! the REAL PAIN starts in case of any cancellation Few cases I have undergone:1) Rail booking which I cancelled - refund amount (~ Rs 1200): It;s more than a month now, I am still following up with the makemytrip support : NO REFUND received till date2) Hotel cancellation: Close to 25 days now - NO REFUND received till date From these 2 transactions I realize that if we do not follow up - they just SWINDLE the Refund. I am sure that people with busy lifestyle - this just falls through the cracks and we do not notice that the refund is not done. I frankly suggest that people be very aware and careful on any refunds related to bookings done on makemytrip",1
3220,"I bought airline tickets to Cochin India from Orlando, Florida on Makemytrip.com. My itinerary consisted of 3 legs - Orlando to Frankfurt, Frankfurt to Bombay and Bombay to Cochin (and return via the same route). Before I flew out I checked my itinerary on the airline (Lufthansa) website and found that one of my flight legs on the return (Bombay to Frankfurt) was canceled by the airline operating the sector (Air India). Makemytrip had never informed me of this and so I called them to find out why this happened. They asked to take the onward journey to India and to contact them after I complete the journey. They fixed it after I reached India. Also there was a schedule change for the first leg of the return. Kingfisher airlines which was operating the direct flight from Cochin to Bombay canceled this route and re-routed me via Chennai (resulting in an additional 5 hours of airtime). Though this occurred before I started the onward journey Makemytrip never conveyed the information and hence I couldn't the change the ticket. Before my return I called Makemy trip 72 hours before as they had stated to confirm my return. On my return I took the first leg from Cochin to Bombay via Chennai. I tried to check-in for my next leg (from Bombay to Frankfurt) at the Air India counter (operating airline) and they couldn't find the eticket number. The eticket I had from Makemytrip website was invalid and exchanged. I contacted Jet Airways who was the issuer of the ticket and they didn't have the updated eticket number either. Finally I got the new eticket number from Kingfisher but by then the flight had taken off. Makemy trip never updated the new eticket number on the itinerary and the information didn't flow into the other airline systems. I was stuck in Bombay and trying to get the confirmation for the next flight flying out the next day. I contacted MakemyTrip and they never provided any help asking me to deal directly with the airlines. I finally got confirmed seats via Jet Airways. I took a hotel in Bombay and the spend the day there. I boarded the AirIndia flight to Frankfurt the next day. But once I reached Frankfurt Lufthansa didn't have my updated reservation. They did offer to put me in a waiting list for the flight that afternoon. The flight was overbooked and we never got through. One of the Lufthansa ticket agents was an angel in disguise and she sorted the issue and got us confirmed for the flight departing the next day. We ended up spending over a day at Frankfurt airport. In effect we spend two extra days ( 1 in Bombay and 1 in Frankfurt airport). Imagine going through this with two little kids aged 5 and 7. It was nightmare and MakemyTrip never cared to help in anyway. Every time I call it goes to a different guy sitting in a call center and asking me to explain again what went wrong. Several times they said I will get a call back but never got this. Once I spoke to a Manager by the name of Dharam and he seemed genuine assuring me that he will find out what happened and to expect  a call back in a day. I waited for 5 days and called him back. I was put on hold and then they hung up. Amazing; Plain and simple Makemytrip messed up on the reconfirmation and reissuing of the etickets and never owned up to any of it. This is the last time I will ever book anything on this site and I can't wait to spread the word on this terrible company; God Bless Nivi Abraham",1
3221,"No refund on 1+1 free ticketHi All, My name is Sachin. This is to bring to your notice fraud by makemytrip on 1+1 free ticket offer. I booked a ticket on makemytrip after reading their 1+1 free offer for 15th july delhi to guwahati, when I was about to book my free ticket I reconfirmed from the call centre (ref no IN1007R0025220) spoke to agent ravinder on whether I will get a refund of Rs 2800 for flight 6E221. The agent confirmed that I will get refund. After travel, I again called up the call center (ref no IN1007R0043354) with agent Parul. She confirmed that money will be credited to my account within 15 days. It has been over 35 days now that no money has been credited. I made several attempts to get my money with makemytrip via call ref (IN1008R0020861, IN1008R0030451, In1008R0045383). Wanted to warn all members to avoid using makemytirp.

3222,"I booked my tickets from NYC to AMD. They charged me 1300 USD and didn't give me the fug tickets. NOw, I have 1300 balance on my credit card and I am still without tickets!!! Looters...cheaters....never use this website!!!",1
3223,"I used makemytrip.com for my trip from USA to India. My warning is - NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER USE THIS WEBSITE. Reasons. They said free unlimited airtickets in india if you book through make mytrip.com - All you need to do is give itenary and pay taxes! After booking tickets I called. They said I have 24 hours to send my request. I did for 2 destinations. Guess what? They wanted me to buy tickets as per their list price on website. When you inquire, they follow the following procedure a) Keep you on hold for 3 hours b) Standard statement: "" sorry sir our systems are down"" c) Sorry sir that is the price my system is quoting for taxes When you ask why is your website showing taxes as Rs 1200 and you are charging Rs. 4200 for same flight same ticket- they say"" sorry sir our system is down"" Basically drag it out of 24 hour limit they have and say time lapsed.- Its FRAUD in USA Now your ticket!!!! They book through unrelated airlines with no code share or no business deals ( like kingfisher and Lufthansa). Route you through mumbai. Never tell you that domestic and international airport takes 5 hours to complete formalities. They lied saying that both terminals are in same airport and I need just 2 hours to board plane from domestic transfer to international terminal. Trust me, It is a lie. Both are 5 kms apart. My flight was delayed, I was stuck in domestic terminal with no shuttle that came fater 43 minutes I landed. Took 20- 25 minutes to reach international airport. I was late and they refused to check me in. With lot of pleading I did check in and to my horror immigration and security took 2 hours! My experience was Makemytrip is fraud, worst website, with ZERO customer support. if you want to fly from destination A to Destination B and do not care if flight is 3 hours late go ahead. But if you travel international, Makemy trip is not equipped to handle it. They lie, they do not know the rules, their systems is always down( wonder what it even means! for a webiste company) and they use unethical sales/advertising practicies to mislead people. AVOID MAKEMYTRIP.COM LIKE YOU WOULD AVOID the worst company on earth. In my opinion its the WORST OF THE WORST. I would never ever book through it again.",1
3224,"In the month of May 2010 five of us from the family took a makemytrip tour to Darjeeling and Gangtok. The first disturbing experience was at the Mumbai airport itself where the airlines on which we were booked could not find our reservation to Delhieven though we had confirmed tickets. After a delay of about 30 mins we were finally issued boarding passes. However we all had to sit separately sandwiched between the aisle seat and window seat. Since we were forewarned, at Delhi airport we immediately went to the airline counter to get our boarding passes for the Delhi Bagdogra flight. To our dismay we were told that they had no reservation in our names. When we recounted our experience at the Mumbai Airport the man at the airline counter at delhi said that it was our good fortune that seats were available for the Mumbai-Delhi sector and so we were allotted the seats. After another horrendous delay of about 40 mins we were issued the boarding passes and we could reach Bagdogra. We had been informed that a Tavera motor vehicle would take us to Darjeeling. However the vehicle made available was a Sumo and some of us had to really rough it out on the sideways seats. At Darjeeling we were told to wake up next day at 4 am and be ready by 5 am to set out to see the sunrise at the sunrise point. We were ready sharp at 5am but alas the vehicle which was to ferry us to the point just would not arrive. We tried to phone the local man of makemytrip and after much delay the vehicle arrived at 7 am by which time the sun had already risen and people had started making their way back from the sunrise point. Towards the end of the trip we came to know about some disturbance because of the GNLF bandh. However makemytrip people kept reassuring us that everything was under control. The day of the return we were told that we would be ferried by state transport buses and that we should be ready at 5 am sharp. However no buses turned up till much later and after much delay we reached Bagdogra long past our flight time. At the Bagdogra bus stop there was no proper organisation to take the passengers to the Airport. Sporadically some one from makemytrip would appear and in a great rush take any one group to a taxi and then disappear altogether. Finally after a long time we could manage to get transported to the airport. No one from makemytrip was available at the airport to guide us in any manner and we were all left to our own devices. One group who was from gujarat told us that they phoned makemytripwho had arranged for tickets for them on a GoAir flight to Delhi which was soon taking off. We also phoned makemytrip. Howevertheperson who was on the phone said he had no authority and would call back in 10 mins. No phone call came and in desperation we used our credit card and bought the tickets on the Go Air flight and reached Delhi and could also catch the already booked Delhi Mumbai flight and got home. Another group who was stranded at the Bagdogra airport was helped out by us by giving them some spare cash available with us. Later they informed us that aftera longtime somebody from makemytrip arrived and put them up in a hotel in Bagdogra. Next day instead of being flown to Delhi which was their destination they were flown to Kolkata where also they had to spend a day and the third day they were finally put on a flight to Delhi. Now when we are demanding that we be refunded the extra expense which we were put to, makemytrip is wriggling out of their responsibility. Never will we ever again travel with makemytrip.",1
3225,"Please do not really relay on this trip, booking is OK but if you cancel ......you will see god on earth or devel you can see in yourself....... as you will be tired of the followup with the given false dates by the make my tirp team.......... I strongly recommend the organization should change the respective reimbursement department team with dedicated team who can and will understand the commitment of the date and time given........ just cant play with money like this..... here goes the story !!!!!!!!!! We booked the ticks to goa from Bangalore and due to some emergency reasons I cancelled on 22nd of july 2010 & I got the online confirmation saying 29th july 2010 the money will be credited to my debit account which I had booked....... Trust me I had called at least 7 times to customer care and requested to credit the money as I had some emergency reasons to rise the funds .....after all big time struggle they promised please wait till the time you see in website.......at last the time has come and based on the date thinking the money will come in I had issued a cheque to a client on 30th july 2010.........there they failed to credit the money & I did not get it at all..... After a very long and too long discussion the customer care person said ""sorry"" due to some reason its not been credited so just asked me to wait for 3 more days...... I really saw devel in myself and god on earth to rearrange the shortfall in my account.......... BUT THEY HAD NOT FORGET TO COLLECT THE COMMISSION FROM ME :( I STRONGLY RECOMMEND NOT GO DEAL WITH THESE KIIND OF CHEAP OPERATORS WITH BAD MANAGEMENT WHO HAS NO VALUE FOR PUBLIC MONEY............... WITH LOT OF PAIN SHREE Moral of the story - keep your own sense open and dont trust on service providers blindly I want to thanks this guy at MMT whose cooperation got us back in business!!",1
3226,We started from Mumbai for Amazing Ladakh. Surprisingly we had the full frills Jet airways flight from Mumbai to Delhi at 2000 hrs. The connecting flight from Delhi was at 0510. %hrs at Delhi Airport was the only pros of the tour. But that can be given a miss for the price we paid i.e. Rs 27000 for 7N & 8D. The flight from Delhi to Leh was a Kingfisher Charter Filght. We were greeted by makemytrip at Delhi and LEh. At Leh pur cars were ready to take us to the hotel. A qualis with not more than 5 passengers excl driver. The Hotel Leh Chen was good..do not expect 5 star comforts..the food was good and the staff very very friendly.,4
3227,"This is perfect con site, they take your credit card number and overcharge it, if you try to call the customer site they decline to refund and say only way out would be to 'cancel' the ticket and that will cost further cancellation charges, There is no supervisor who can make the call in customer support and people working there have no understanding of airlines or credit card systems. Please avoid this site at any cost if you can. This experience of using this site was a nightmare and I paid dearly, hope I had done some research and read through few reviews, in fact I found a website where some ex employee of this site has claimed about a scam they run there with customer information from web site. I wish some regulators take action before other people get ripped off.",1
3228,There are many serious flaws as I had first hand experience on makeMyTrip car rental service - I booked flight from Bangalore to Delhi and opted for car pickup from home to Airport. I was charged flat 449/- for car pickup in Advance and I paid it. 20th May 2010 early morning - The MakemyTrip Car never showed up. I check with EasyCab(as it showed in car pickup voucher) and they had no clue about this booking. I called your customer care and they had no idea what to do or where to check about it. Finally the guy suggested me to make alternate arrangement for my travel to airport. I had to arrange CAB on urgent basis which costed me much higher as compared to my normal pickup arrangements. Due to MakeMyTrip car pick mess I lost precious 1 hour. Somehow I managed to get to airport just in time to catch the flight. MakeMyTrip customer care did not accept request for refund and asked me to call after completing the journey for the refund. I dont understand what is the point they were trying to make by doing this(may be they like to keep their phones keep ringing). I called on 23rd and registered complaint - IN1005R0059109. Till now there is no acknowledgment or action from their side. I called for followup couple of times. and was told that you will call me within 48 hours. I kept on waiting for these 48 hours to complete. I called several times. was put on HOLD and few times no one even pick p the call. I was feeling like giving up at times. I lost my patience and wrote a strong feedback on their custoemer support site. All I got in return an automated email acknowledge that someone willcontact me in 24 hrs. This time. I was really contacted by a gentlemen Gaurav. He assured me that my refund will be processed within 48 hours all I need to send an scanned copy of the taxi receipt which I had to pay to go to airport. I felt better.(read on.) I sent the receipt promptly(within 30 minutes) and again got an automated acknowledgement. Days passed with no email or call from MakeMyTrip. I called again on 20th June to followup. Customer acre agent asked me to send the scanned copy of receipt again(why?). anyway I did not argue and immediately provided it and even confirmed with her if they have received the scanned copy. Today is 7th and I am still waiting for the refund or any call or email from MakeMyTrip (don't assume it is my full time job to wait .) but literally there should have been some action from them after all every time they gave me clear timeline - 48 hours . . I am still waiting for my REFUND. I have sent an email again. but I have actually lost all hopes. One thing is sure that I will never use their service again as I have already heard of MakeMyTrip sending fraud E-tickets to the customs. At least I did not had to thought that BAD incident. but I have learnt very clearly if a company has SUCH customer service. I can get into worst situation and there will be no need to help me. So why to be I that situation. just avoid MakeMyTrip.,2
3229,"I recently read book on Deep Kalra and was impressed how he started this company and how he struggled and got into a position where the company is right now . some how I was very impressed, there is where I made a mistake - thought a IIM guy would have his guys well trained and would run the organization very professionally . I booked a ticket from JFK to Bangalore .Air India was giving the best deal . I fell for it and spoke to the call center and bought two tickets after confirming that the all my baggages would get cleared in Bangalore, I would just have to change airplanes in New Delhi( never traveled via delhi . and was not aware that it had two airports and they were apart and did not have a train connecting . The Best Part was I was told to do the customs clearance in New Delhi - I was shocked . so I asked the ground staff that would I have to clear the baggages as the Baggage tag said BLR. They said yes .As I normally travel I had 4 huge Bags and 4 hand baggage all within the international norms( me and my daughter were going to BLR) I had to do the custom clearance and then the nightmare started . I had to go to another airport with all these Baggages. some people helped me and was able to reach the domestic airport and there when I went to the counter they demanded extra money for the Baggages as they do not fit in the domestic norms. I tried convincing them but in vain . I had to pay thru my nose for these Baggages and they would not let me speak to their manager even . Some how I managed to get to Bangalore . Next week my Husband is traveling and he also has the same flight tickets and I & him have been trying to get in touch with the MMT call center guys they have been telling me that they would trace the call and give me a call back which never happened . I have tried no. of times but nothing is happening . I am frustrated . any one reading this has Deep Karla's email id or phone #, please forward that to me - I want to tell him that what kind of resources he is housing.",1
3230,"Their online and phone systems seem archaic(they are the origin of my complaint) and customer service is completely un-empowered to solve customer issues.I tried booking a flight Delhi-Bangkok and kept on getting a'timed-out' message on their system. I thought it might be my new credit card but waited 10 minutes before trying another just to make sure I didn't receive a confirmation email saying it went through - before trying another credit card. Then I noticed the fare had disappeared from their site and thought perhaps the fare had expired or had been taken so I tried booking the next fare(same flight - higher fare). Still said'Timed-out'. I had generally had okay experiences with MakeMyTrip prior so I thought I would just call them. The phone call took close to 40 minutes to make a booking as the guy on the other line kept placing me on hold for two minutes - every two minutes. Finally, he noted that I already had three bookings made for the flight just as he was collecting my credit card details. I couldn't believe it! I had received no confirmation from their site - just the'Timed-out' Message and no emails. All of a sudden, as he said this to me, I received three confirmation messages in my email box(hmmm). So I said, ""No worries - just keep the first flight booking I made and cancel the others."" The guy on the other line, Rohit Sharma, started talking about putting me on hold(it was about midnight at this point and had already taken 50 minutes) and cancellation fees! I blew my top! Their system had errors AND they had taken 40 minutes to try to complete a booking and they had the nerve to talk about cancellation charges! Rohit was polite but said he needed to fill out a form to see if they could waive the fees, etc. but needed more information(please hold), etc. It was turning into a nightmare! It still didn't end - this morning I got up and Kanika Talreja informed me they had cancelled my trips - that is - they cancelled all my lower-fare trips on the flight and kept the one that had a higher price! Why would I want to cancel the lower fare to pay more on the same flight? To line their pockets of course. So I wrote a couple emails - no response. I tried calling - I get cut off(three times). I am now waiting for an online chat person as I have no other way to ask them for a resolution! Still waiting. Please wish me luck! At this point, I think I'll just be happy with my money back from them - forget the flight! I thought it was a decent company but I have told all my employees at the company I run to avoid MakeMyTrip. I have also warned my credit card company that these guys are clearly seedy. Was able to get them on the phone through going the new booking route. Spoke to Jagjit Singh(not the singer) who did not get it despite me explaining 4 - 5 times. I tried to break it down and mention there were two issues: 1) the online system saying it'Timed out' and still charging the customer and 2) I had requested and confirmed the cheaper ticket but that was still cancelled and one of the higher price tickets(I had asked to be cancelled and have an email proving so) was instead confirmed. He kept on looping back to the first issue saying nothing else can be done until they do an internal case to see if it was my fault or theirs and then they will charge me accordingly for cancellation fees(gee, I wonder which way their internal investigation will go).",1
3231,"One good thing about the MMT is that they have price advantage. but if u go for cancellations, they will rip u apart and the refund time is minimum 3 weeks.(IRCTC will refund in 3- 4 days), if we call the customer service, they will tell that a customer care agent will contact u within 36-72 hours. Twice it happened to me.Who will have the patience to talk to these call centre ppl . who knows nothing and will keep you on hold for 10 mins(of course free music provided) I think its their agenda to keep our money for 3 weeks and its not a sign of a good, ethical company. My suggestion is that, its better to book through the direct airline website, IF there is any cancellations, atleast you can prepone or postpone with minimum charges",1
3232,"I have used this site in the month of April. I came across the info for this site through the promotional offer given by icici bank on my credit card statement. The offer clearly stated a 30% cash back on online booking in make my trip.com. I have spoken to banking officer at icici, as well make my trip agent regarding any cap or conditions being attached to this scheme and I was informed that all I need to do is use the promo code while booking and no cap on the payback. I went ahead and did bookings for my entire summer holiday trip in the month of April. Till today after following up for 3 months what I got as cash back is 2% of the amount I have spent on booking. This is absolutely misleading and fraudulent practice to lure the customers and should be stopped immediately and should not be repeated",1
3233,"We booked a package tour through the tour operator Make My Trip, magical ladakh on dated 5th June, 10. We faced such a horrible and troublesome experience with you I will never forget. On reaching to Delhi in the midnight no Dinner was offered to us( as it was supposed to give us as mentioned in the tour plan). on the next morning there cab came to pickup us at 6:50am. Our flight was scheduled to depart at 8:10am as par their itenarary . but surprisingly at the airport, Kingfisher staffs told us we cannot board as the boarding is closed at 7:15am and the flight is about to depart at 7:30am. They have no flight schedule at 8:10am to Leh. We just shattered and could not decide what to do at that time. We called their representative number of times.They talked with the kingfisher staffs and we came to know that the changed time has been intimated to their staff Mr. Prem but no intimation was given to us. they ultimately kept us in the hostel day long. Think about the situation , we were six adult and two children. Their reps. could not confirm our tickt day long. even nobody came to meet us. We had to shift to the airport at 2:30am next day for confirmation of tickets.Their reps. was trying to sent us to the airport alone but we compelled them to send one guide to accompany us.Just think of the situation we had two children along with us.On 7th june we reach Leh in the morning. But instead of keeping us at rest for the day to acclimatize at such high altitude we were forced to go out for sightseeing. As a result of that some of our co-passengers fallen ill.My three year old baby had vomiting and fever.As par their schedule staying four night at leh we forced to cut short to three nights at Leh. On the day of departure from Leh they were supposed to give us breakfast but no such arrangement was done. We reached at The Delhi airport at 9:15am on 10th june We had our return flight to Kolkata at 6:10 pm that was also booked by the company. It was very horrible to stay at transit for about nine hours. They could have arranged our return flight earlier as there ware nos. of flights in between.

3234,"For our first family foreign holiday I chose Makemytrip.com (MMT) and feel I should not have. I chose this service provider mainly because of price and convenience of timing of tour. I chose a trip to Singapore & Malaysia which was advertised for Rs. 40 K. After taking my confirmed booking, I was told much later that the choice of dates was not available. However, if I chose, I could take a tour on the same date but for a 30% higher cost!! I had to agree as Iwas constrained by dates. This meant I spent about 30% more than what I planned for. I was assured that this 'upgraded' tour was more relaxing - with direct flights and better hotels etc. However, I discovered later that my return flight was a hopping one - Singapore to Malaysia and onwards to Mumbai as the flights were booked in Malaysian Airlines which transit via Kuala Lumpur (KL) only. Hotels booked were good and we were happy with the same. Except that on the day when we landed in KL at 7 am in the morning, we were told that the hotel check in was only at 2 pm and therefore without a wash, we were taken for sightseeing !! And the hotel check in ran into problems and we could check in only at 4 pm.. By which time we were tired and angry... The sight seeing organised was average.. It was done with a local tour operator and there was no one from MMT to accompany us.. The local tour operators do not care for giving us great service and sometimes can treat Indians as second class citizens (we discovered this to our dismay at Singapore). Also, the local tour operators tend to take us to shopping joints of their choice so that they can get a commission for our purchases. So, instead of sight seeing the new city / country, we end up going to many shopping centers :( When we tried to go for optional tours, we discovered that the costs of doing it ourselves was cheaper by almost 50%.. The local guys charge us a bomb for everything without giving us value for money.. Food was good at certain places but pathetic in a couple of places.. As vegetarians, we had to struggle for our type of food.. Overall, the food experience was average.. My biggest complain about MMT is that they are not fully involved in the trip and are not physically present to ensure the comfort of the customers.. We might as well have gone there on our own..",2
3235,"Make my trip is a popular travel port, though I feel it does not live upto its name even a bit also. The offers look quite attractive on the website, but actually they are not worth the expense. As soon as you make the payment its just a confirmation itinerary which is sent promptly with your hotel vouchers.Then onwards its you who will be the one managing or making your trip. The conveyance they provide will be through a tie up with some travels.They just give you the interface no. and you will have to take care of your trip with that person from then on.They will not even bother to call and check on how the client is being treated whether the customer is safe...nothing!!! Not even a single courtesy call or follow up by them. I had recently been on a Rajastan package for 10 days and had a terrible time with their conveyance agency linked. Overall Issues we faced are as listed below: -The drivers are mostly fakes.Beware and check /get their identity confirmed well in advance. Overall the contact of the person and the taxi details sent by them were different from the person who came to the airport, then the same person told that there are some internal changes and some other driver is going to come.This new fellow was ignorant of the whole stuff and not knowing anything of the places wasted most of our time ...about 2-3 days.The first person even cheated on his name telling he is Arjun singh, then Rajender singh etc....every now and then so that there will not be any complaints. -The hotels booked in Jodhpur and Bikaner were real bad ones.Not upto the mark as per the package.Just garage like rooms. -There was no desert dunes as mentioned in the itinerary sent by them.It is just copy paste itineraries in their website.The accommodation was in the resort and no dunes near by.So the whole objective of going to Jaisalmer of having a camel safari and seeing the dunes is lost.Even if we wanted to go, there were immediate next day bookings to other place which would have been a risk. -The drivers don't want to go to many places in the itinerary suggesting they are far off and they have",1
3236,"I had to fly between delhi and lucknow and booked my tickets via makemytrip (for Indigo). Indigo cancelled the flight and makemytrip didn't inform me for any such cancellations. Being connecting flight, I was unaware about any such cancellation. Makemytrip guys didn't take any responsibility to provide alternative.. I would strongly recommend to book your flights directly via airline websites... This will keep you updated with latest info about your flight. Makemytrip can help only for finding best available combination, but avoid bookings here. Even the price displayed in makemytrip's website is almost equivalent or higher than airline website's price while cancellation price is usually very high. I don't find any reason to take such risks.",1
3237,"I booked 3 tickets to India from Newark, NJ to Ahmedabad, India and return flight for June 26th, 2010. For unavoidable reason I needed to cancel these tickets. I called them to inquire about the fees and I was told $375 which include their $50 cancellation fee plus $325 by AirIndia. This seemed high because I had Refundable tickets so I called AirIndia (gave my PNR) twice and both time different agents told me that the fee is $200 plus the agency cancellation fee listed on my confirmation (which clearly states $50 per passenger). After second call to makemytrip.com at 800-463-4210and questioning why I am asked to pay $175 more then the airline cancellation charge, I was asked to hohd and Anuska (agent) told me that it will be only $325 per passenger. So I asked why it is way higher then it should be and told her that AirIndia agent told me that I should not be charged more then $250 per passenger. So she hanged up on me. I called back and this time I got Rohit on phone to whom I explained the fee overcharge then he said because they are gettinj discount from AirIndia, by cancellating this ticket they will loose it and that is why. I told him that but that does not have to do anything with the cancallation fee I am getting charges. I asked him that makemytrip should charge the actual fees and not inflated fees so that in future the customer comes back to reserve the tickets again. So after making me on hold he says that he talked to somebody whom agreed to forego $50 for each passenger and only you charge me $300 per passenger, I said but last agent told me $325 so $50 minus will be $275, he said no it will be $300 or I need to call AirIndia and ask them to put a note in their system for this PNR that they will charge $200 cancellation charge and he said when I call back they will look it up and charge $250 for each. I called AirIndia and they said they can not leave any note in their system and to ask for that by an agency is absurd as they know it can not be done and a way of overcharging fees to customer. I think this MakeMyTrip.com is unfair in charging excess fees to customer and I ask readers to think twice before booking with such agency. I will caution one more thing that this agency charges your creditcard in India so you will be paying extra 3% to your credit card bank for foreign transaction fees on top of ticket charges. Hope this helps someone.",1
3238,"Recently I had to book a return trip to China. I searched on many travel portals like makemytrip, yatra, expedia, ezeego1, orbitz I was surprised to see that the best fares came from makemytrip.com (Surprised coz I thought expedia is a Microsoft company and they would offer better prices). I was also amazed by one more thing. The same flight, same route, same day flight on ezeego1.com was just double amount quoted by makemytrip.com. I wonder how they are still in business. Yatra.com came worst as it couldn't even find my destination code. Can you believe it? Even my travel agent quoted me a higher price for the same route and in the end he gave up and told u. me to book through makemytrip.com SURPRISED, arent you. EVEN in this competitive market. One more thing I would like to tell you. I had opted for a multi city trip and it was 3 thousand more if you do the booking separately. As in One way to go then one way to other city and one way return. TRY it. You might save few bucks. I did my first booking through the portal and when I tried the second booking, it got declined as my credit card had insufficient balance(just short of 200 rupees). I was worried as if I postponed it a day further then the prices might go up. So I just went for live chat. And a very helpful agent Ms.Sonia listened to my problem. She further gave me a discount of Rs.200 and booked the ticket for me online. Got the details verified on checkmytrip.com and made sure everything is OK. Only then she asked for my credit card details. I was delighted to get such a good response. I also booked a rail ticket from the site. The user interface is so simple to use. And when I booked, it was a Wait list ticket. Got a msg immediately on my mobile. Then after a day I again got a msg giving my new status of the booking. This is really helpful as you dont need to check the status yourself. Quite convinient I must say. So all in all, to sum it up. I have become a fan of this site and whenever I will be traveling, I will surely check the prices first on makemytrip.com",5
3239,Not delivered as promised. Take you for a ride. Bad customer service. Do not go for this for national packages. I was promised by this agent on a few things and after that I was totally surprised to see that it was different from what I was promised. My honeymoon trip was a total mess. I would suggest all to please not go for makemytrip. The local agents in the tourist spot are lot better. I chose a trip for Kullu/ Manali. When I called the customer support it took almost half hour to connect to an agent and after all the wait I was told that they cannot do anything about it since it is not there in the iternary. A lot of things are promised while booking and finally after the cash has been transferred there is nothing worth to the cash paid.,1
3240,"Lots of reviews are negative primarily saying suggested hotels was not nice, extra charges etc. All I request is to do your home work and book the hotels based on reviews etc from other websites. It hardly takes 10 minutes and you can even weed out fake reviews. Yes, Makemytrip is supposed to do that too but I would rather get my own information also rather than depending on a unknown person in the customer support. I searched for hotels in Mysore, read reviews from other sites ( Tripadvisor, even Yatra etc.) and then shopped around for the rates in the internet. Makemytrip had the cheapest rate ( 20% less). Once booked I just called the hotel and told that we have booked and checked if they had the neccessary details ( Date, Rate etc.) and the hotel confirmed. Makemytrip confirmation says that you do not need to call but as said I trust only my own info. Had a great stay in a very nice hotel ( Pai Vista) @ 20% less. Their Breakfast spread is excellent! So please do your own research and book for the cheapest rate - be it Makemytrip, cleartrip or Yatra.",4
3241,"On 22nd of April 2010 I have booked a Railway ticket of 2 Adults from New Delhi toHowrah on Rajdhani which cost me somewhere around 3100+ and due to some technical failure the booking was not done but the money was deducted from my Debit card SBI Account. n ireceived thebooking id RAL60001080470make my trip and after that I recieved a mail from Makemytrip.com that the booking was not confirm and if any money have been deducted from my account will be refund the entire payment within 7 working days but till date 14 June 2010 the Money is not been transfered and few days back I have send a email seeking for my money to Refund but they have replied me back Dear Customer, Greetings from MakeMyTrip! At the outset, we apologize for the inconvenience caused to you. With reference to your email, your booking id RAL60001080470, Sir, we would like to inform you that your transaction is not confirmed and it’s a failure transaction. Hence we would like to inform you that if your amount would be debited then kindly send us your bank statement. So, we can validate the records from our end and we can assist you further. Once again, please accept our sincere apologies for any inconvenience caused. Let me assure you that what happened in your case is not typical of Makemytrip’s level of customer service. We continue to be committed to providing you and all of our customers with the highest standards of service in the industry. How can they expect customer to waste their time for it. I don't have an online account so I cant send them the bank statement I can send them only the hard copy but I don't have enough time. if I would have so much time then I would not have been booked from their website so Friends be careful when u book from Makemytrip.com and if u book read the payment refund policy carefully",1
3242,"Here is my total experience. I have brought a ticket from Atlanta to visakhapatnam and vice versa. Makemytrip has charged more than 300$ than they are supposed to be. To get that amount back I called makemytrip around 12 times and finally got the amount back after almost 1 month. They always try to cheat you. I received an email saying that the amount is deposited. After a week luckily I chekced my bank account and found that only 8$ is deposited. then I called them again and blasted them. As usual an apology is given and no resolution. After 12th call, it got resolved. The worst part is one of my connecting flight ticket got cancelled automatically. AIr India says that makemy trip did not purchase the ticket properly. Only God knows how I reached my home town. Now on the return ticket again the PNR stauts is not viisble on air india flight. Again I need to start 12 calls to makemytrip. This makemytrip does not  have minimum sense that any customer will not bear with this much patience? Its not all about studying in IIMs and IITs and establishing an organization. You should know your customer. Some customer service guy said that he will call me at 10.00 AM IST and update the status and he is no way in picture till now.",1
3243,"An advice to everyone who wants to book plane tickets using this site. Use the airline's site instead. For searching low fares use ixigo.com. It takes you to the airline's site after showing exact fare(without any service fee that is charged by sites like makemytrip). I have been a regular client of makemytrip.com. I have booked many holidays, flight tickets(when the airlines' sites don't have payment options apart from credit cards) and sometimes hotels. I have to admit that most of the times the service has been satisfactory, but the recent experience with the Ladakh trip certainly exposed a lot of holes in their weave. Before getting on with the experience I would like to clarify that I am not complaining against the bad weather, because a natural calamity is not in anyone's control. But the arrangement of alternatives, providing timely and accurate information and serving the travelers are certainly the organiser's duty. If makemytrip continues to be associated with the hotels and agents that were present during our trip, rather absent during most of the time, then it won't be long before they lose credibility. It was a package tour of Ladakh for 4 days, beginning 13th May 2010, ex Delhi, with inclusions of Delhi-Leh and return air tickets, hotel stay at Leh, vehicle for sight seeing & airport transfers and Breakfast and Dinner on all days. we had booked our Mumbai-Delhi & return tickets independently. Everyone faced the following problems. The deficiency of service is quite visible: 1> The food provided by the hotel(Grand Willow) was horrible. 3 people in the group got loose motions on 2nd day. There was no one from makemytrip to listen to our complains. On the last day we raised our voices and we got better food. We could clearly see that the food served to us on the last day was what the hotel used to serve to their customers who weren't the part of the pre-paid package tour and who used to order a-la-carte. All the good quality food was kept away from us and we were served lower quality food on the first 3 days. I am sure that Grand Willow was included only after the demand for Ladakh trip increased(Makemytrip had no tickets available before 13th June during Mid April when we had booked. There were 2-3 makemytrip groups touring parallelly in Leh when we were there, presumable in different hotels). I am not complaining about the standard of the hotel stay here. It was satisfactory. 2> The person, Mr. Sunil, who was supposed to be our trip manager and who was supposed to accompany us on all our excursions was absent on all days after the first day. Upon check in at our hotel, he gave us instructions with a severe attitude. Like we were school children. Then he went missing till things got really messed up on the last day. 3> We couldn't visit Pangong lake and Khardungla because of bad weather on both days. Again, makemytrip is not to be blamed for the bad weather. But for the following: a) There was no alternative arrangement done in case of bad weather. Only on the last day when things got a little out of hand and Mr. Organiser was summoned did he suggest us 2 local places that were not in the itinerary. Since makemytrip was paying our money to the ""Wisdom"" drivers whether we reach an intended place or not, they could have suggested those alternative places anyways. They could have been more proactive on alternatives. b) Speaking to a lot of locals we realised that it is very common for the weather to be rough for this part of the year(Ladakh's winter extends till May, only July-August are hot). I met another group who were independently touring Ladakh(not with makemytrip) and even they couldn't go out on 3 different days because of bad weather. This brings up few important questions: i) If Ladakh's weather is this bad in early May then why organise tours during this part of the year in the first place? Why not warn people in advance about bad weather? ii) If a tour is organised in this season then why is such a tight schedule made? Why not extend the tour from 4 days to 6 days to accomodate for unplanned cancellations? iii) Why not include beautiful local places like Stok palace, Sangam(Nimmu), Hall of Fame(Army museum dedicated to Kargil victory) and the school shown in the movie 3 idiots in the itinerary as alternatives? iv) Why not keep local Monasteries on the last day's itinerary so that even if the weather is bad and the long roads are closed we can cover those monasteries? i.e., If on the first day we are visiting Pangong lake and if due to bad weather it is not possible to cross Chang-la pass, then we can easily cover local monasteries that day. Then we can try for Pangong lake excursion again on the last day. 4> There was a discount of 2000 rs. on offer to anyone who booked the tour before 15th April. Even after satisfying the criterion, we were not given the discount, citing the following reason: The discount scheme was launched after we made the booking, and makemytrip has all the rights to change the terms and conditions. Fine, but if we didn't get the discount, then why did 2 Gentlemen, who were a part of the tour, get the discount? How come terms and conditions apply to us and not to them? One more matter that came up was that the 2000 rs discount mentioned was not clear. Whether the discount is per person or ""per group""? No surprise that they gave a ""per group"" discount to the 2 Gentlemen. Finally, I have no complains against the place and the people of Ladakh. We had a very good experience. But for the money we had shelled out, our experience could have certainly been better had makemytrip done a few things differently. Just to put things into perspective, makemytrip uses group booking 1 year in advance and their total airline cost per person is only rs 850(mum-del-leh-del-mum)+ 450(airport charges)+ 100. Whereas they ask for 18000 to 20000 rs per head for the trip. A special mention for Jet Airways who followed the rules set by Govt and arranged for our accomodation and food well when the Delhi bound flight was cancelled due to bad weather. Our coordinator Mr. Neeraj Sharma came to our hotel and was more proactive in that one day than makemytrip's Mr. Sunil was in those 4 days. He even replied to our phone calls regarding airport transfer properly.",2
3244,"I had booked a flight ticket from patna to bhubaneswar. The flight was  jetlite and kingfisher.   This ""makemytrip"" had cancelled my ticket to kolkatta(reason not given) and there was no way going to bhubaneswar. I called jetlite callcentre and they told me that you will get full refund.   The tickets were cancelled. They are processing my refund swallowing rs.4000/=.out of seven thousand and odd. I had sent many emails to service@makemytrip.com.  None of them answered personally. Computer generated reply only comes.  I am a senior citizen. I cant get their address and toll free no is of no use. I can only say they are parasites living on the blood by not providing proper service. If somebody have got good service it is by the grace of god. Really i am frustrated. Waiting for the refund, of balance, before my death.",1
3245,"Alright so me and my family came across make my trip's ad in the newspaper and we chose ""Charismatic Kashmir"" Package as the executive said its the best and paisa vasool. It includes Srinagar, Pagalgam and Gulmarg (and not Sonamarg) know why?? They want us to go there through our expense by telling the driver that we give you extra money if u take us there as we're curious to know why they've not covered this place. Chaalu people!! 1st Day Srinagar..we roamed around the market with our expense and that was okay..2nd day Gulmarg which included in package went well. 3rd day it was Pahalgam so we thought why to be in Pahalgam for 2 days instead lets go to Sonamarg. The other people in our group agreed to it and we told the driver that we will pay him for that..That day we were supposed to check in a Hotel called Abbshar in Pahalgam somewhere in the Noon but as we headed towards Sonamarg we said we can only make it to Abbshar in the night and that was very well informed to the tour manager. As we went to Sonamarg we reached Pahalgam somewhere around 10 PM and we showed our voucher to the Receptionist and he started taking us to a Hotel called Good Luck infront of Abbshar which looked like a ""khanddar aka bhooth bangla"". And we were taken aback and asked him where we were going, he said ""Sir, this is our Hotel aswell and as Abbshar is full we will give rooms here and we were pretty surprised and it was 10 PM, we were so tired and irritated when he said that. We started arguing that if its mentioned in our make my trip plan that we will be provided rooms in Abbshar why u taking us to that Khandar? He said there are 20 families provided here from make my trip and they're full and we asked him then why you people allotted for 22 families? we 2 families are extra kya? what the hell you people speaking? The Receptionist started saying I was on leave Sir its somebody else's fault. Is it our fault that we approached make my trip people? They kept us waiting in the Reception till 12 AM. We said we're not going anywhere to the khandar, you give us room here or give us a letter that make my trip has a poor management. We somehow managed to get a letter from the tour manager and his signature and they gave us 2 small cottages. They said we will be given our rooms by tomorrow morning. Finally we slept off around 12 30 and we said we're not going anywhere in the morning as we are sleeping late so get us a cab somewhere around 11 00 and we will go for sight seeing. I am damn sure that the rooms which were alloted for us were given to some outsiders who were not from make my trip because they get nice money out of it. The problem with us is we tend to adjust everywhere ""ADJUST KARLENGE NA""<< So if u decide to choose make my trip get ready to sleep in a khandar or in different hotel which isnt alloted to you or drop going to Sonamarg even after going so far and not seeing it and regret later. Our whole mood was spoilt the 3rd day and we just wanted to come back as soon as possible... Courtesy spoilmytrip.com",2
3246,"I am going to write the greatest blunder ""Make my trip"" made and which has affected me in the worst possible way. I booked one flight from Bangalore to Delhi on 29th Apr, 10 around mid night for the next morning.

I was like how is this possible, I have the e-ticket with me and I paid for this. Being stuck in the situation, I called MAKE (RUIN) MY TRIP customer care and all I got was "" sorry for inconvenience "". Hats off to the confidence with which I am getting the reply "" sir your amount will be refunded"". What is matter with these guys , they could not even understand how important can be the travel for someone, what can be the circumstances under which a person is traveling. and just saying sorry n all the blah blah.. its was just adding to my mental trauma. I just could believe when this happened. And adding more to this the guy at customer care said ""its not our fault its a technical fault"". Its their business damn it. right and they are at fault if their system is at fault. After that he said sir but we cant do any thing else. and then while putting the phone down , He said "" thanks for using Make my trip"" OMG they have got balls and they don't care what the hell you say, just you get to hear some recorded lines.",1

When I called makemytrip.com, the customer care guys didn't care about the issue and shamelessly kept on telling me to take whichever seats were available. I was travelling with two small children and these people wanted us to sit at different places. Highly unprofessional.

The details of the same are as follows for you to check: Consignment Number-Z11355558 Courier Company Name-DTDC Website address- http://www.dtdc.in For any queries and questions call on inbound number 011-40785161 Hope to hear from you soon or I will go on to escalate this matter.

3250,"First let me put down the facts. Otherwise it may be termed as allegations. I booked a hotel (hotel Lakeview, Ooty) through makemytrip on March 16th, 2010 through makemytrip. The following is part of the mail that I got(pasted at the end of the review). In short, I paid Rs.7842 that includes Rs.2434 for extra bed for children. But when I landed in the hotel, I was told that the money for extra bed has not been paid to them and they would charge me if I avail that. I was told to contact makemytrip. I made more than 8 calls throughout my stay worrying if I could atleast get my money back. Went through their painful authentication process with some automated advertisement in between. This ad was totally uncalled for when the customer is in distress. Now, even after checking-out, I have not got my money back. The hotel gave me a receipt for only Rs.5900. Customer service simply say that the matter has been escalated( they have repeated this for the fourth day in all the 7/8 calls). I don't know if they know the meaning of escalation when the issue is pending for four days. They also simply say""we apologize for this and that... we understand your condition"". If they have really understood, I would have got the solution in the form of extra bed or refund of money. Neither happened. The excuse is that they are unable to contact the reservation after 6pm. When an issue that is escalated is pending for 4 days, they don't do anything unless I call them.  If you want to differ from me then I would say that you are lucky.  Their customer service is lousy and insensitive. When you beg them to resolve the issue, at the end of the conversation, they would insensitively ask, ""What else I can do for you?"" kind of statement. At that time, you won't know if you have to laugh or cry. Payment Details Room Type Extra Charges Amount Deluxe Cottage Rs. 2, 434( Extra Bed + Extra Child Charges) Rs. 7, 762 Sub Total Rs. 7, 762  Taxes and Service Fees Rs. 80 GRAND TOTAL Rs. 7, 842 Grand Total (in words)Seven Thousand Eight Hundred Forty Two (INR) Thanks, Raja",1
3251,"I went to ICICI Bank net banking. There I saw Makemytrip is offering Rs. 200/- cash back if I do booking using net banking provided there is one code ICICINET to be entered into their promotional code. Hence I did that and did payment using ICICI Net banking. They didnt return Rs. 200/-. When I inquired through their customer support, they simply refused saying I had never entered that promotional code which is ""ICICINET"" . Any Tom, Dick or Harry will also know where and how to enter those promotional codes. This is shows what level of cheaters they are. I searched google with words like travel croos..fraud, and got this link which isMouthshut.comand then I realized this website (travel operator) is blacklisted by most fo the user. Alas I knew about it!!! Never ever to any booking on make my trip. They are cheaters of the first order. I had faced similar situation 2 years back. But I was new to these kind of bookings at that time.",1
3252,"I tried making a rail booking. Money was debited from my account but no booking id or reference generated and neither was provided any reference of the failure of booking on my email id. And there the harassment begins. called there customer support and they asked me for reference no. and then bank statement and they never came back and I have to repeat this story every time I call the help desk as they don't have fund of incidents or service request or complaint but booking ID. So beware, irctc is very good in refunding your money and they are not.",1
3253,"A 1 out of 10 is very high for them.These people suck. They cheat, They are Cheap, They take your money and never book your tickets. They are good in just one thing, deducting money immediately. Customer Service is Sick. They don't know how to speak. They lie about calling you back and you never gets a call back. When you call them back they say that the person you went to talk to is not available, not for a day or two but for a week. Let me explain my story. I took a open return ticket. I have flown one way. When I called to make the tickets they said I have to be 3 days flexible but I am willing to be 10 days flexible to book my return ticket. They say that they don't have tickets and I have to pay fair diff which is equal to double my one way ticket price. Open ticket means they agreed to issue me ticket when ever I need it. But they changed the whole scenario. Why should I pay the fair difference when I paid the total amount in full when I bought the ticket. They are saying that they cant even refund the money so that I can buy it from somewhere else. These guys are Sick. They sell the tickets for the people who pay more and not for the people who paid the full amount in advance. Customer service is so horrible that they don't even know hoe to talk. And what to say about managers. Damn guys.They will loose big time in their future if they do this to the customers. They don't even have guts to talk on phone with a customer, they make their subordinates lie to customers to tell them that they are unavailable. What the heck are they doing in their offices without assisting customers for a week. Stupid acts.These people are good for nothing. I warn all of you. They will rip you off..on't buy from them. I am sure that this company will close in next one or two years. am going to file a complaint against these manner less fools for my refund.ts not less. I paid around 2000$ and flown one way. I am asking them for a return ticket or issue a refund. They are not ready to both. They are willing to give me a ticket before 11/2 month from the date i want to fly.",1
3254,"I selected today(8 Apr 2010) 5 tickets from Chennai to Delhi. The amount was Rs 17760- I was directed to my bank website and the amount was duly debited from my account. I was taken back to their website, where to my dismay, I saw a message that the tickets are not issued due to technical difficulties which would most probably due to non availability of tickets at the time of debit. They have informed that it would take 2 working days to repay the amount. My question is, why don't they first get an Authorization from the bank (that they hold funds) and Airlines (to hold seats) through back-end API calls and then finally debit my account? I am working for MNC online payment processing Company and have some experience here. I tried explaining to Mr Lucky Kaul, but he was totally unreachable. I will never again use this Company and I will also inform all my friends not to use. They don't realize, word of mouth feedback can easily ruin their business",1
3255,"Make my Trip ruined my holiday plans at the last moment>  Wanted to go to Jim Corbett for a nice holiday with my family,  booked my hotel Jim’s Jungle Retreat, Corbett from 2nd to 4th April 2010. Received a confirmation mail from Make My Trip that the room has been booked and the same was followed by a Hotel booking Voucher from MMT, which so ironically said ""Kindly note, your booking is CONFIRMED and you are not required to contact the hotel or MMT to reconfirm the same"". Then to my horror, received a call from Make My Trip in the evening that the booking was not made and it was some stupid error on their part and thankfully they will refund the complete amount and it will be reflected in my credit card statement in the next 7 days. Now here are a few things:- 1) As it was peak season I was not able find any other hotel of my taste in Corbbet, as a result my holiday plans went for a toss. 2) The whole weekend was cursed by my family as they were so excited to go on this holiday. Will never trust Make My Trip again and will prefer to book holidays either directly with the hotel or through a more trusted travel agent .",1
3256,"I was offered a lifetime card by employees of indiatimes, as told by the persons on the telephone. This offered lifetime discounts at certain places, as well as some vouchers for discounted travel by make my trip, in association with shift thoughts.com . On inquiring about the cancellation procedure, without using any of the benefits, i was not clarified as to how i can do it. But with indiatimes and make my trip being involved, i thought there would be no scam. But i was wrong. On receiving the kit i find that they have included only a 1 year validity dining plus card. On complaining at their phone no. I was attended to by a lady named neha. She said she would get back to me within 1 hour, and resolve my problem. This has not happened in the past 4 days also. Now i want to terminate this card/deal/vouchers and receive a full refund immediately. I know these companies like indiatimes.com or makemytrip.com or associated companies, which are all part of this big scam going around, will probably not even listen to me. But i hope to just beware the others to not fall for scams by these or other companies or sites. Hope my problem is resolved. Sandeep garg Ajmer",1
3257,"I am so pissed off with Makemytrip.com guys right now that I wish I met them in person.I called them to make a booking for my minor son travelling all by himself from India. Even before we started off on the dates of travel and all..I had clearly told the customer rep lady that he was a minor and would need airline assistance all the way from India to USA. She kind of acknowledged that she understood and we went ahead and made the reservations concluding with an assurance that I will be receiving an email with details on his assistance. everything went well so far. A week prior to his departure date I called them up to confirm about the airline assistance procedure since I did not receive any kind of email.To my horror the rep asked me to call the airlines and confirm it. I kept my cool and went ahead and called the airlines, Lufthansa and US airways. Lufthansa agreed to assist my son till Frankfurt where he had to change flights and board a US airways flight. Even though I was not happy with the MMT service I was still ok with it so far. I called the US airways and got a heartattack. It seems that they will not provide any assistance if the minors are on a connecting flight, it has to be US airways from Origin to Destination. To make things worse, they will not allow a minor to board the flight if he isnt with a parent/friend/guardian. In one word he will be stranded in Frankfurt. I go back to MMT and ask them what they did with my request they did not have an answer. I had no choice but to cancel the booking and pay a 45% cancellation fee ( which was not told at the beginning) I called Qatar and made a new booking for the same day, with assistance for only a 20 dollars more then what I did for MMT. Worst services is all I can say. It sends shivers down my spine to even think about what would have happened to my son if I hadn't made this call.",1
3258,"I was Cheated into booking tickets to Atlanta, US through Makemytrip.com.  Please be warned that Makemytrip.com will take you for a nasty trip!  They should be called RuinMyTrip.com. I had insisted and got tickets from New York to Atlanta and back at convenient times and without any stops.  These were confirmed tickets. Yet, after a week, I get an e-mail from them that the flight schedule had been changed by the airlines unilaterally and gave me tickets at an awkward time and with one stop each way. On checking with the airline, they informed me that they had not taken any such action, and also that Makemytrip.com had opened my booking three times in the period. They told me that the change was only made by Makemytrip.com. When I again contacted them, they refused to help.  I then spoke to a supervisor called Mandeep who promised to get back within 24 hours. As he did not keep its promise, I tried to get in touch with him at least four times. The assistant would only keep me on hold and Mandeep would be missing.  All the assistants maintained that there was nothing that makemytrip.com could do to correct the schedule. My son, who is in the US, informs me that this would have been done by Makemytrip.com to give me a cheaper ticket at the same original rate, as these tickets at odd times and unnecessary stops would be much cheaper.  He also found out that there was no reservation of seats, though I was given seat numbers by makemytrip.com.  They were just lying to me to get me to book the tickets. I see that many, many customers have had similar nasty experiences with this crooked travel agent in Gurgaon.  Do they enjoy political patronage?  Else why is no action still taken against them?",1
3259,"Had a horrible time with these folks. I had a reservation blocked and was told that I had 24 hours to book. When I call them the next day, they say that fares have changed. While I was holding the request, they did not bother to inform me that fares could change. Very unprofessional. Added another $200 to my itinerary. The funny part was their fares changed in a span of half hour and they were promising me that the fares would not change for a few days. Bottomline is either pay when you book or risk it..they are not going to help you there.",1
3260,"I warn you to be careful while using service from makemytrip.com. I had a bad experience with these cheating company. they have messed up my reservation and trying to charge penalty to me for their mistake. It's a messed up organization, always miscommunication to customers, when I called up for clarification, didn't get any convincing answers, always I was told that the complaint was escalated and I will get a call in next 15-20 minutes and never got a call from them. And also they add lot of hidden charges during cancellation etc. I recommend yatra.com or Goibibo for flight and hotel reservations, NEVER USE makemytrip website. I am regretting for using makemytrip.com for my flight booking. Regards, Dinesh",1
3261,"I booked hotel in Aurangabad through makemytrip.com for two nights for two people on 9th January, 2010. I had to extend my stay and hence I called their helpline (one for airtel customers) and requested them to book me for one extra day. They obliged. I received the confirmatory mail and then the real game started. In the conversation I kept referring to my earlier booking of 2 nights and that I needed to extend it for one extra day and was suggested that I make a fresh booking. I was asked in whose name would the booking be done and I replied in my name. Result: the booking was made for only one person (no reason offered as to why the booking was made for only one person when I did not specifically asked for one person and kept referring to the earlier bookings). When I went back to them asking them whether this booking can be converted to a double room, I was told that I had to book a fresh room (why would that be, I still don't understand) Thirdly the booking was made non refundable whereas this information was neither shared with me nor was it negotiated with me. I was told by the makemytrip operator that the seller (in this case the earlier operator) had done it and that he was not available. I then asked to speak to their supervisor, the answer was they were busy and can not come now, and that he did not know when they could come and attend to this call. I was also told that they needed to listen to the phone conversation to verify the truth of the situation and that it would take 48 hours to do so and I simply had to wait. Just to add a little thrill to this, my name was indicated as MR despite my correcting the previous operator and his making a note of it. I have been quite regular with makemytrip but I pledge here that I shall never ever go back and make any bookings through them ever again.",1
3262,"I would like to change my review from dissatisfied to satisfied. The make my trip payment page had debited the ticket charges from my bank account but had not issued me a ticket due to a glitch in the software. I am happy to report that the charges have been reversed and I have got the full refund within 5 working days. I will not be using makemytrip to book future tickets since they seem to have a software problem. Have found another travel website. Makemytrip has a good business model and it has worked for me for the past 3 years. Only in the past month have I faced this problem. But then as they say, once bitten twice shy. The organisers at makemytrip could have tried to win back my business by offering me free tickets or discounts. Sadly, their customer service department lacks the training and skills on how to win back lost customers.",1
3263,"I have made couple of bookings for Flight and Hotel in November 2009 for a Family Trip to Mumbai to Goa. Since inception I was getting troubled due to one or the other reason. First Hotel booking date were change. This was their website issue. I can say this confidently as by profession I am a Software Engineer and know it in and out. When I called them they have started countering that its not their mistake. Finally I got away with the same by taking higher category room in the same hotel for the period I required. Unfortunately, The flight became non operational. It was 17th Nov 2009. Since then I am following up for the refund and till the date I have not got full refund. Every time I call up they are making commitment of refunding it withing next 4-5 days but that days never come. Finally I got 2 Partial Refunds after 11 Jan 2010. Lastly I am still expacting refund of 2022 Rs which they have charged as cancellation Fees which is not applicable in my case as Flight got non operational . Their Presales is Pathtic. Actually company like this fooling people on the name of good service. I suggest every reader to go to a local agent rather going along with MMT.",1
3264,"I booked a ticket from Coimbatore to Kolkatta. It was a hopping flight via Mumbai. The reference was FLT 00008870216. I was charged for the full route but later I was informed that the booking was not confirm from Coimbatore to Mumbai and their representative is going to contact me within 6 hrs and incase booking could not be confirmed I will be refunded full amount for the unconfirmed ticket. But what about booking from Mumbai to Kolkatta. If cannot reach Mumbai, how can I catch Mumbai flight to Kolkatta. SURPRISING!!! While  booking ticket they showed availability and had also charged the full amount. Later they apologized for the mistake but if the mistake is theirs why should I be penalised. It is extremely unpleasant experience and I had to cancel my booking and I was charged the cancellation amount of Rs 2000. So for their mistake I paid a fine of Rs 2000. It is recommended that everyone should be careful while dealing with them. Preferably don't deal with them as there are already so many complaints against them in this forum itself. I missed the reviews against them in this forum and paid the price.",1
3265,"When you cancel booking, they would never refund you in full unless you see and find yourself. They would keep your money and when you ask them the reason, they would investigate and come back with no answer. Moreover, their cancellation charge are exhorbitant. I made a booking for Delhi-Jorhat and back. Since there isn't a direct flight, I was booked into 2 flights on onward and 2 for backward journey. Unfortunately, I had to cancel the booking. They charged me a cancellation fee on each sector/passenger. I didn't mind paying the airline cancellation fee as they are different bookings for them but makemytrip should have charged a cancellation fee on the booking and not on each flight. They processed a partial refund unless I found out myself that I have been refunded much lesser than what was to be refunded. They didn't have an answer and asked for another 72 hours to process refund. Why would someone appreciate this timeline when a company is holding back on your money unethically. I shall choose to buy tickets direct from an airlines website rather than makemytrip.",1
3266,"Hi All & C.E.O of Make MY Trip. I am Ventapathy from Tokyo, Japan. Here is my second worst encounter with Make my trip. I am using makemy trip since 2010 . Since 2013 I believe I am making almost 1.5 to 2 Lakhs INR Transactions with Make my trip. May be its time to change.  Dear reviewers suggest me some alternatives.

Again same error occurred in makemytrip.com during payment. Immediately I received call from India Agent. They made booking for me in phone and asked me to pay through website. I made the payment 876 USD  for booking IN1511B6S189720 . I checked my card statement on 20-NOV-2015.I surprised to see that, first two transaction(on 16-NOV-2015) which was ended up in error was also deducted from my card. that is 134638 JPY / around 73000 INR  without any Booking reference. 16-NOV-2015 112031 JPY  - NO BOOKING REFERENCE 16-NOV-2015 22607 JPY  - NO BOOKING REFERENCE 20-NOV-2015 876 USD IN1511B6S189720 - No problem in this as Have purchased my Ticket.

3267,"To tell in one line the worst customer service I have ever seen in my life is Makemytrip.com   The incident was I was trying to book a flight ticket in Paramount Airways on Jan First week. In the final process the website went down due to technical errors. The money has been taken from ICICI Account.  I called the customer care that night for more than 10 times but no one was giving a proper reply what happened to my money?. Every time they were telling different answers. Finally next day one customer care person told makemytrip.com received my money and will book the tickets and sent a confirmation mails for the same. But again after 2 hours I got call from another customer care person it was wrong message and you will receive your money back within 72 Hours. So in this mean time I was happy that I booked my tickets but finally it didn't happen. But when I called the customer care after 2 days the person was saying it will take another 7 business days, I was totally frustrated about the time I spent on makemytrip.com and the insecurity of my money for the same.I told him the experience and frustration I had with makemytrip.com for the whole incident and asked to connect the call to manager when I asked to connect to the manager, but this guy being a brilliant customer executive he put the call on hold for more than 10 minutes so that I will get farustrated and leave the Call.Great Thinking buddy . That time I made sure that I will never open Makemytrip.com in my life. I told all my friends, colleagues in my MNC company, relative please don't use makemytrip.com for any reason anymore. I also read very negative and fradulant actvities about makemytrip.com atleast I was lucky that I got my money back.",1
3268,"I don't earn a lot to fiddle with all payment options. But the one time I had to pay through the net banking facility listed in their website, it failed. Not only did it fail, but also did it take off all the money. Which means I couldn't attempt again. With flight rates soaring high as the days near the departure date, they said I HAVE NO OPTION but to wait for 3 to 5 business days. And my flight was supposed to be in 3 days. If they have an error prone payment gateway, they should have stopped that service. And their sorry's don't help. { Reply for the comment on this post by'ask'} It is too late now for help. But here is the order number: FLT00009057898 And the email from makemytrip.com also said this : ""In the rare event that the amount is charged or blocked in your account we shall coordinate with the bank and have the money reversed ASAP.The money should reflect in your account within 2 business days."" While, as I mentioned before, cc Avenue, the payment gateway for this company promised the refund in 3 to 5 business days, the 2 days mentioned here is just ""rhetoric"". It has been more than 3 business days already. The company does not understand the importance of time and money for a customer and they are in the flying business!",1
3269,"I booked a hotel in Karwar (Lotus Resorts) via makemytrip for 31st Dec 2009 weekend. They recommended the hotel heavily (I was on phone with makemytrip), and said the hotel was a 3 star, with a pool, 50 mts from the beach, had a gym, 3-4 multicuisine and specialist restaurants, gym, minibar, and great ambience. I reached the hotel after paying them 21, 001 and a tiring 12 hour drive from Bangalore. Here's the conditions: The hotel was half done, woodwork in the lobby was on with deafening noise, same condition in the adjacent room alloted to me. There was no swimming pool, no liquer license hence no drinks, no gym and the beach was 4 kms away! What we finally got was a half finished hotel and not a place anyone would want to spend their 31st night in. We asked for a refund and they promised a callback and resolution within 2 hours.24 hours has passed since. This experience has taught me the lesson of not trusting makemytrip.com for anything in future and I would recommend anyone to really think again before booking in this site. I do plan to place a complaint against the owners of the site makemytrip.com upon my return to Bangalore.",1
3270,"Beware of the cancellation policy. They will ask you to contact airline directly if you are cancelling within 6 hours. However if you contact airline directly, the airline customer care will say that they can't do anything and you should contact makemytrip directly. Another thing is it's also impossible to reach makemytrip customer care on the tollfree nos they publish. First of all the voice menu options doesn't have anything about speaking to an executive directly and you have to be smart enough to figure out a way to reach them. Even after you reach them, you'll be put on hold for more than 15 mins. After trying for 3 days and spending 3 hours, I could reach them only once and half through conversation I was cut-off as I started asking them some inconvenient questions. If you don't care much about after sales service then you can go for makemytrip otherwise stay away from them.",1
3271,"Hello All, I am surprised to see so many people criticizing MMT .I have booked with make my trip many times & never had any problems.I find MMT prices lower than any other site including  the  airlines itself  ( exept ibibo for airlines..). I am surprised how they offer lower prices  than the airlines  itself. I had once booked  few air tickets with MMT for which they gave a discount coupon of 500 for hotel bookings. Later I happen to make a hotel booking & thought of trying to  use the coupon &  was very happy to get the discount of 500 rs . I always use mmt for the first search and it always the best search specially for hotels . once in an e ticket they gave incorrect PNR ( I came to know when I checked the pnr with he airline site ) but on request they corrected it , however I think airlines only check the name( & valid I card ) since they know these site make such mistakes. any way I am happy with MMT & always use MMT as my first search, and I m surprised  to see so many people critising MMT , are these marketing people of other sites??",4
3272,"I am writing this mail as a pained customer of makemytrip and before mentioning what has happened I want to suggest some good ways of doing business which is completely lacking in this site: 1)- Very poor customer  care service.** Customer calls are put on hold for like hrs and with a simple word "" I apologize"" by the call center executives- makemytrip expects customers to bear all the pains and long call holds. 2)- Completely no ownership for customers. If I take a connecting flight package from makemytrip and miss one flight of the package due to airline delay. Nobody takes the ownership. Only the customer is made of bear the grudge (Eg. I miss one Go air flight on this package:FLT00008177766**, because of Air india delay and strangely noone took the ownership. I had to loose a lot of money and rebook the tickets with lot of pains) If you cant take ownership of such packages- why to offer them at first place???? Airlines told me that it is the problem of the travel portals who are fooling the customers with such packages. Completly pass the buck game as you can see and only the customer looses without any fault. 3)- No care for customers problems: My flight was cancelled **FLT00006589280and I got the intimation from Kingfigher that too by a sms only a week before. Again had to suffer a huge loss of re-booking at much higher prices. Sadly makemytrip people were even not aware. 4)-No care for customer losses: I am still awaiting refund for this order:FLT00008337898.  I got only the partial refund and makemytrip is again not aware of this till the time I have to call 10 times over 15 days with like 30 mins waiting in each call. God saves the customer!!!! The above are some of the examples mentioned above which shows how poorly this business is currently run with no care /concern for customers and their losses. Also we get feedback mails- god knows who you guys do with those feedbacks (trash??)",1
3273," This is to bring to your notice that, we had a bad experience by opting for Make my Trip as our travel agent. The problem started at the booking stage itself. We had booked for your package tour to Kerala (Hills and backwater). After we made the payment, our vouchers came in batches and that too after several calls and reminders. Calling your customer care is a pain as we need to repeat the same things to different persons. The person booking did not take any responsibility or follow up. The problem doesn’t end here it just gets better. When we arrive at Cochin station, there is no pickup for us. When we contacted the customer care, we got the response - “Our Hotel booking reps only come by 9 AM, so we can’t help”. The land line no. given of the taxi vendor was of no use, as no one picked up the phone. After several calls we managed to speak to one Mr. Ravinder Kumar who claimed to be a supervisor. All this while I and my wife were waiting outside Ernakulum (Cochin) station waiting for our transport to the hotel. Finally one cab came and we thought we were on our way, but no such luck. The driver said the car has a flat tire and needs to be changed. We finally started at 11 AM instead of 7 AM from Cochin to Munnar. As a result we lost valuable holiday time. On reaching Igloo Nature Resort another disappointment awaited us. While booking for the trip Ms. Rajneet Sohal had insisted upon taking the Igloo resort claiming it to be far superior to the Misty mountain property. I had seen both the websites and was very much interested in Misty Mountain. She claimed that Igloo had a better location and view; also the rooms were better in Igloo. I took her word for it and ended up with further disappointment. The hotel is good 10 km before Munnar. It is not even on the route to Munnar and is actually a big de-tour. The resort is in a secluded village way below the Munnar hills. It has no tea plantations around it. While misty mountain has a much better location and a definite better choice. I felt cheated by Make my trip. I have a strong suspicion that Igloo resort is giving a bigger incentive or discount to ‘Make my trip’ to book people at this place. This resort claims a rack rate of 4000 rupees, which is a joke considering its location and lousy food. I am also surprised that no representative, manager, Ranjeet or Ravinder bothered to check back with us, about our trip. I myself am from hospitality industry and my wife is veteran of customer care, we understand that problems happen and complaints are a part of our work, but utter lack of commitment and apathy is uncalled for. Probably, I wouldn’t have had to write this mail if anyone would have checked back on my trip. Well I for one would not be booking with ‘make my trip’ again and would advice others to follow suit.  Also must mention Ms. Manjeet was the only person in your customer care who was a little helpful when we wanted to change the travel plan for the last day. It was too little and too late.

3274,"I booked a 2 return trip tickets from Ahmedabad to Mumbai on Make my trip, Made the payment & got a confirmation of the reciept of the same on mail mentioning that the tickets would be sent in half an hour. Within minutes I realised that the bookings need to be re done & contacted the customer support for the same & I wish no body has an experience like the one I had. Upon informing the customer service representative of the faux pas who was not interested in hearing me out but more interested in telling me that there would be penalty charges & cancellation charges ( I had not even recieved my tickets nor a confirmation of the bookings)... She ensured that I hold for eternity (20 mins approx) & when I lost my patience holding on I asked to put on to the Supervisor who is non existent or sits next to the PMO's office in Z plus category security where access is denied - I was never put through to him/her & this so called customer care (harrasment ) representative in the meanwhile ensured that the bookings were confirmed & sent me a mail of the same !!!!!!! Make my trip makes a neat Rs 250 per domestic ticket that is booked through their website & could not possibly lose out on Rs. 1000 while fully relishing the prospect of making another I was ultimately hung up upon & without giving up called them back this time too without any access to the supervisor through a different CC representative. As my schedules had changed I had no other alternative but to cancel the tickets which cost me a total of  Rs 4000  (Make My Trip in the entire game made money as service charges @250 each booking & each cancellation too) I would not have lost the monies in the first place  had their customer care representatives been so insensitive about the customer issue. Writing to them is yet to draw a response after 5 days !!!!!! I atleast can expect this after making them richer by 2k TO ALL YOU GUYS OUT THERE MY RECOMMENDATION IS DO NOT BOOK YOUR TICKETS THROUGH THIS SITE AS THESE GUYS ARE OUT TO FLEECE YOU & DO NOT BE ENTICED INTO THEIR TRAP OF PROVIDING CHEAP TICKETS - THEY ARE JUST MARKETING GIMMICS !!! In fact the Makemytrip philosophy is Make Money at all costs & should be renamed as conmytrip.com or makemoniesatanycost.com",1
3275,Please never ever book flights through makemytrip...... They are best cheaters in this universe.....I booked ticket for my wife to india and got a very good price. But after that I faced the music. I never got it confirmed for 2 months and ALWAYS MAKEMYTRIP REPLIE THAT IT IS A CONFIRMED TICKET..they never return calls... Finally I have to book another ticket by myself from clt to jfk for another $104 from orbits.com. I would have probably given them '0' if that option would have there... finally I wasted $1200 in this trip...Beware of there customer care... they talk very nicely... but full of shameless guys and frauds....

3276,"Wanted to book international ticket. Was on 1800INDIA10 number for 2 hours and was transeferred to railways resevation then hotel reservations.and domestic Air.and so on. By the time someone came on phone from international ticket, seats got sold out and they begged from me 10, 000 more to continue.it was really begging, Basically the real story was- they knew that I needed tickets.so they increased the fare purposefully.and system is not transparent because of following reasons. Their ticket  fares don't match airlines's prices. Their cancellation policies are worst than airline's policy. They dont know how to get u right seat.call airline direcly and they help you out more professonally. I needed travel urgently.So I had to buy it. But I think, I never use them again in future and advise everyone around me the same. WORST Experience. I wish, I could record my phone conversation and attach it here.",1
3277,"Hi I booked a Hotel thru the makemytrip.com website on 17th Nov 2009. Voucher no HTL 3000467582). This was a stay at Hotel Clifftop in auli from 26th dec for 4 nights. The website promply charged my card for 30k & sent a confirmed hotel stay voucher for 4 nights. I was thrilled & soon after, made Flight ticket bookings from Mumbai-del- Mumbai & made road travel & other bookings from Delhi & back.(costing appr 50k) After few days, I get a call from their office saying that my hotel room is not confirmed as yet. I told him that I hv already recd hotel confirmed voucher & my card has been debited. After this, I called numerous times, sent numerous emails. However all I recd was that they will get back soon. I simply asked that how come you issue a CONFIRMED hotel stay voucher & debit customer credit card without even checking with the hotel concerned. finally after days, I managed to reach a senior manager Called Aarti. she promised to close the matter next day. However that never happened despite calling her. They refused to allow me totalk to a Senoir or General manager. All they offered was a refund. I asked that who will bear the costs of the airline cancellation, road travel cancellation ans ofcourse my family is going to be left without a holiday this christmas & now we will end up incurring much higher reservation costs if at all we do go. I would like to appeal to their founders - Deep Kalra & Mr. Joshi to relook at how their orgn is treating customers with utter disdain & unprofessional attitute. I am furious & till date, I am yet to hear anything from makemytrip.com. All they have done is spoilmytrip. disgusted & furious. Chetan Shah.",1
3278,Confirmed booking issued by MMT with 100% advance payment was disowned by hotel. MMT failed to do anything. They promised 4K in damages on email and cancelled the booking. Later they went back on the damages also. This was just a ploy to cancel the booking. We are left with having to cancel other bookings that we made on basis of this confirmed booking and also make alt arrangements at our own cost and time. No damages or compensation for harassment whatsoever. No follow up from support even after escalating. No resolution yet as of 1 June 2018.,1
3279,"I recently booked ticket from Ahmedabad to Bangalore for two tickets and everything went well. Airline Inigo. I did receive confirmation email and the history also shows up confirmation. To make sure my tickets are booked properly, I have visited Indigo website and verified the confirmation. I am kind of surprised to see that the price quoted in the Indigo website is about 3% higher than what I paid in MMT. With the confidence again I tried to book a ticket from Coimbatore to Mumbai. By the time I paid with credit card, the response I got is due to communication error the ticket was not booked and I will receive the refund within 5 days. After 5 days I received the cancellation information along with refund authorisation number. However, the mail said that it may take up to 30 days for the credit card company to process the refund and for any clarification contact the bank and NOT them. What I fail to understand is, goverment entity like IRCTC can refund the money within 3 business days to the credit card but MMT takes 30 days is puzzling. Many a times the prices are cached from previous search(to improve performance?) but when you try to make the purchase, you are presented with a message that the price is no longer available is really annoying. I think Indian online booking is long way to go when compared to developed world and only pray we would catch up soon with better integration and customer service.",3
3280,"I have been booking my tickets through makemytrip for some years now. I would like to tell you about a recent goofup that they did and are unwilling to budge from the fact that they are responsible for it. This is the second time this is happening and after thinking that it was my fault the first time this happened I made sure that the second time I do not make any mistake, I booked 2 tickets from Bangalore to delhi 1 month in advance to the flight date. half way to the month I had to cancel one of the tickets. Now I called MAKEMYTRIP call center and informed then that I need to cancel only one of the ticket from the existing booking. I explained to them multiple times that please cancel only one ticket and the second ticket should be the way it is. They assured me and they would do the needful. On the flight date my dad was in the airport ans he was informed by GOAIR that both the tickets have been canceled. When I called MAKEMYTRIP call center they gave 4 to 5 ways of how the ticket got canceled. All ways was intended to pass the buck to the airlines or customer mistake. I called airlines and they said the ticket were canceled by Makemytrip . This is happening to me the second time. When I called my close friend he said that this usually happens with these intermediate travel agent who get a single PNR when then book 2 tickets and canceling one of the tickets frequently cancels both the tickets. If that is the case why don't they tell the customer about it. Currently MAKEMYTRIP is saying that it is GOAIR who goofed up and GOAIR is saying MAKEMYTIP goofed up. what shall I do ? Currently I am filing a case with consumer court to take it up with the management of makemytrip.",1

3283,"I needed to go to Pune from Bangalore on some URGENT work and NEEDED to be there before 9 am. There was only one flight Kingfisher Red for that time and so booked that flight and a return on the next day. I had booked a ticket to Pune on the 2nd of December and return on the 3rd. On completion of the booking got a message: ""Your payment has been processed. However, due to a communication error, the system was unable to confirm your reservation. Our customer care executive will call you within six hours on the phone number provided by you at the time of booking. "" So called up the customer service and they informed me that there was a technical problem and they couldn't book the Bangalore to Pune ticket. So told them to cancel the entire ticket since if I reached after 9am it was no use going. But they informed me that only the Bangalore to Pune will be cancelled but NOT the return. Isn't it COMMON SENSE that first the departure should be confirmed and only then the return. I'm not denying that there could be computer problems. But if there is a problem shouldn't they be willing to cancel both the departure and return. If they had a technical problem why should I be made to pay for it. When my ticket to Pune is not booked what sense does it make to book my return. from Pune. Had to pay the cancellation charges for a journey which anyone with common sense will realize is MakeMyTrip's fault. Usually book my tickets using CLEARTRIP but first time used MakeMyTrip since the ticket was around Rs. 700 cheaper. Well thats why the quote ""PENNY WISE POUND FOOLISH'. These people are just outright CHEATS",1

After our vacation when I checked my account there was no cash back and these people say that they didnt promise as well. The employees at Make my trip are not at all trustworthy...please dont use make my trip........instead Travel guru is better they gave us all the cash backs they had promised.",1
3285,"I booked airline tickets over the phone with an agent the middle of October 2009 using a credit card. They said they were having issues with their automated credit card charging system and hence coaxed me to provide the CC details over the phone. Which is not an unusual request considering that its a reputable company like MakeMyTrip it didnt arouse any suspicions. I gave the card details over the phone to a Himanshu Handa and Seema Chaudhry who ultimately booked the ticket. (I don't know if its a real name or a fake alias.) The amount for the tickets I ordered were billed immediately on my card. However, next day I found out that there were 2 more fraudulent charges on my card on behalf of makemytrip for $411.73 and $269.24 respectively. I immediately reverted back to MakeMyTrip in India and called them several times giving them proofs including credit card statements about the other charges not being authorized but, I have not received any feedback. They have been just dilly-dallying and ultimately I had to file a charge back with my bank resulting in cancellation of the credit card. I am complaining about theft of credit card numbers by the employees of makemytrip and reluctance by the staff over there to take any action. On top of that their customer service is very poor. They didnt even book the tickets properly, I mean when a couple i.e. my parents who are both senior citizens why would I want 2 separate seats in 2 separate rows. Secondly, my mother needed wheelchair assistance and that wasn't informed to the airline either. I had to call the airline directly and sort out the matter with them. I hope people who chance across this review avoid MTM like the plague and never ever give out your CC numbers to even an employee of MakeMyTrip. Thanks, Anish",1
3286,"I had a very bad experience with makemytrip.. I wish I had come here earlier to discover how bad they are... they confirmed my hotel booking and even sent me a confrimation voucher by email and sms. 10 days after that , they send me an email saying that the hotel is not available!! when I spoke to the customer service executive, he was almost half asleep and incoherent... when I asked for the manager, he was outright rude and flatly stated that makemytrip could not help what happened! i had chosen to go to mcleodganj ONLY because of the boutique hotel - Chonor House - and they completely spoiled my holiday by this unprofessional act... these guys just project an image of being a professional outfit - actually they are really very bad, as bad as any lala company... pls stay away from them... i believe cleartrip is much better or even ixigo.com thanks PS: After several emails and calls, they responsed and this time I must say were warm and helpful. Was glad to see that they actually have a ""customer delight"" department. I guess they must sort out their technology issues which reflected an inaccurate picture of availability in my case for them to really be useful... unless they sort this out site usability, support (though late) being good wont help. All the best to them. Since they at least responsed, I will give them abother chance...",1
3287,"Recently we had been to Mauritius through make my trip . After coming back I would not suggest MMT to any of my friends and would like to alert others also.I've already read about many bad experiences about others but what happend with us was different. Everything was ok aft reaching but on one of the sight seeing dates they did take us to pamplemousse botanical garden but did not allow us inside saying our tour operator (MMT) didn't ask us to .And if we are interested , we should go in at our own cost. And when I showed the lady guide the itinerary print out, she simply called her Mauritius tour manager and the other lady also told that they were not informed by mmt . This way we missed going inside the garden.They were rude by asking us to call MMT at our own cost.So when we returned we told the agent in bangalore and she said she'll talk with the higher ups and let us know. As expected they will say some reason(told us that it was an old itinerary on the website) and escape but will not refund your money. Its more than a month, we have not yet received our imint points too and the agent says she'll get in touch with imint and let us know.dunno how many months/yrs they'll take. They dont take you everywhere as mentioned in the itinerary.If race course is mentioned, they show you that from far.Thats all.Its covered as promised by them :-) My kind advice, plz dont go through MMT .",1
3288,"Hi All, I did a ticket booking wth Make My Trip, This is my ref # US0909B00715. The cost of the tickets in this booking was$ 1170.00 After booking this ticket the very next day I found a quote from'Yatra' for$ 1120.00, I forwarded the same email to the customer care team asking them to refund the balance, They did not get back for one month.After which when I called them back they said that they needed a screenshot and not a mail forward. So I sent them a screenshot, then after a week I again follow up, At which point they say that my refund was not approved because I did not send the email within 7 days, Their online ad FARE CHALLENGE reads After booking the airfare, if you find a lower airfare elsewhere within one week from the date of booking, you are required to obtain a printed confirmation of such airfare quote with airfare price, booking conditions, travel dates, number of passengers, airline and date of quote clearly mentioned. Call a MakeMyTrip travel consultant on Toll Free 1-800-INDIA-10 and provide the printed confirmation of the airfare quote for verification. Email requests cannot be accepted unless following a phone enquiry. MakeMyTrip.com will verify the quote for availability and booking conditions. If the airfare is available as per the itinerary quoted, MakeMyTrip.com will refund the difference or adjust the amount against the ticket price. When I asked them why they did not get back immediately they justified saying that they sent an email which was unfortunately was sitting in my SPAM folder( Thanks to Yahoo), If they had to collect some pending money from me would they not have called me? because they will have to pay they didnt bother. Am I wrong in asking them?",2
3289,"Had read mixed reviews about make my trip out here and other websites. Wanted to go to Thailand and was quite skeptical about whether to take the MMT package or not. After a lot of hard selling by the marketing agent who gave me a package and affirmation that ""you will have a pleasant experience and be quite satisfied"" did I shell out my money. However, it was what I had feared. not a pleasant experience at all. the itinerary promises a lot of things and by looking at it you are taken in by their promises but beware friends. what you read isn't what you get. they try and pack a lot of things in the 4 day Thailand Magic package but half the time you end up wasting your tour due toinefficient time managementby the tour guide. the guide assigned to us was so very immature. He didn't have any control on the group and was so inefficient and unorganised that it led to a lot of time wastage on the tour. While taking the package I was informed by the MMT lady Ms. Anshuman that the tour would be within set timings and if there is any delay on our part of more than 10 minutes, we would be left behind and would have to arrange reaching the destination by ourselves. However it looks as if our tour guide wasn't informed of these standards and he was so lazy and relaxed that there was no time parameters for him. On Day 3 of our tour we were to leave from Pattaya to Bangkok at 9 am. However, looks like 9 am means 11-20 am in our guide's watch! After that we went to the Gems factory which was a short distance of 15 minutes away and were told that we had around 40-45 minutes out there to tour around the factory and do shopping. But alas, 45 minutes is again equivalent to 2.5 hours in Mr. guide's watch! He was so inefficient and lazy and didn't bother to take the trouble to ensure that the people boarded the coach on time. In spite of repeated requests made to him by us and other members of our group, he would just stroll around locate 2-3 other group people and then go and sit and wait in a corner. wow what a lovely way of ensuring timeliness. As a result we left for Bangkok after 2 pm. Due to the double delay(leaving hotel late and delay at Gems factory) we were given our lunch at around 3-40 pm. After that as per the itinerary we were supposed to have a half day city tour of Bangkok. But since everything was getting delayed it was a quick tour. **now if you call looking out of the bus window and seeing various temples from the window equivalent to a city tour then I don't know what to say. *the only place we were taken to was the reclining Buddha temple where we were supposed to halt for 30 minutes but again it was equivalent to almost 1.5 hours due to our GREAT GUIDE. Due to all this, we were stuck in bad traffic and checked in to our hotel only around 7-30 pm. WOW if you call a visit to the GEMS factory and reclining Buddha a day well spent in a foreign country then great. as per the itinerary we were supposed to have half day of today free to do what we want. if you call checking in at around 7-30 pm and then settling down and having half day free. can someone please tell me where does the half day start? *THE MEALS INCLUDED IN THE PACKAGE *beware of the ALL INCLUSIVE MEALS PACKAGE. they will say that all meals are included but dont take that and say you want to do only the breakfast at the hotel where you are staying(since that is any which ways included). They will try and tell all meals are included and thats why the package costs a little more and blah blah blah. their idea of a meal is equivalent to a Langar service outside a gurudwara. they will state in your package ""indian meals at indian restaurant"". However go with the notion that these restaurant are like big halls where buffet meals of sub-average quality is kept and wherein you will meet all the possible indians who have come to tour Thailand. It is as if free meal is being distributed and there is os much of pushing and shoving there as if the people have not seen food for days. Its a pitiful sight and if you want to go for a foreign trip and fight for sub standard food and waste your time then feel welcome to take the all inclusive package. *UNORGANISED *we had taken an extra night apart from the package 4 nights and again you can see how well organised the MMT management is. on reaching the hotel we were handed a voucher of 2 nights like the rest of the group members and on saying that we had got an extra night paid for, the hotel said that they were not informed of it. So after reaching the hotel at around 8 pm after a tiring wasted day from the Gems factory and reclining buddha, we had to run around and make calls to the MMT people to ensure that our extra day was taken care of. It was done after some time but what a wastage of time and effort and then again make calls to ensure that our airport transfer was also taken care of. If all this was to be done by ourselves why should we pay MMT in the first place? All in all I would recommend please think 3-4 times again before shelling out your money for MMT. They may offer attractive packages at good prices and all but only when you open the package do you know what lies inside. If they cannot hire proper trained guides for the tours, then they shouldn't conduct the tour. Also no medical aid is kept by these people(since my husband was badly injured during parasailing and had to wait for 4 hours till we got back to the hotel for dettol, cotton and band aid). The MMT people will talk to you very sweetly to trap you in their deal but once things are done and money is paid tey will not even acknowledge emails sent by you and if you call them will very convenoently say ""i didn't receive your mail"" How come they receive the payment emails immediately and not the other emails? Oh yes, also had forgotten to add that the itinerary very nicely describes trip to coral island in pattaya wherein you can see lovely coral formations through glass bottomed boat. But no, we were not given the pleasure of viewing the lovely formations and on asking the guide about the glass bottom boat he said ""its not so good so we don't do it anymore now!"" Wow, why mention it on your website and itinerary if most of the things we have to skip? The coral island tour only includes transfer by speed boat to the island and everything else you have to pay for. He only includes extra things where he gets a cut or commission from. for example on the 1st day of the tour he said ""we will go to cable car ride and to ripley's believe it or not museum"" All this was not included in the itinerary and the smart guide says ""extra bonus we are doing for you"" But on going there you realise that you have to pay for everything- cable car and the museum ticket! So whats the special extra in this? If you have to pay for everything why not go and explore and spend time and money on what you want to do rather than tag along and waste your time. would recommend that if you make the mistake of taking their package its better to spend time on your own rather than be tied down with their timing and itinerary. Just use the transport for getting to and from the airport and from BKK to PTYA and back. Meals can be very easily skipped as they are a sheer wastage of your limited time and not worth eating! You would be happier eating a burger!",1

I called up again after 8 hours, same reply. I thought, they will send the ticket, not an issue. Suddenly after 24 hours they called me and told that I will have to give more money if I want to book the ticket. I got shocked, as after 24 hours, Makemytrip realized that I should pay more. Is’it a bad way of handling people, first take money from people(a whopping 30 thousand for 3 people in my case) and later tell them that only one way of journey is confirmed and departure journey is declined by airline(Kingfisher). I got so upset that I asked them to cancel whole my booking, I realized that may be one day before journey, they may come back and tall that there is not seta available for me. Please give second thought before you use Makemytrip, its my personal advise.",1

3295,"I booked international tickets from Makemytrip, everything was fine till I booked the ticket. After that for some reason I had to cancell my tickets and then the main ordeal started. Makemytrip is very good at booking tickets on behalf of the airlines but for refund situation is much more worse than Indian Railways tickets counter. For cancellation of ticktets and refund amount. I had to call airline directly and then wait for endless days as there is no coordination between makemytrip and airline. To my dismay I found out that airlines has already refunded my amount to Makemytrip but they have their internal accounts issue because of which I should wait for a call back from makemytrip. I have waited for more than 3 months and endless calls to their customer care centre but no response. Every time they say our seniors are looking into it but no call back. Its a funny situation that when internet is moving in new Web3.0 such sort of online mediums are doing bogus business. I would strongly advice to never use makemytrip for any online travel purpose.

3296,They are liars and use pressure tactics to force you to book your reservation. If you have to use them check 10 times before you book. They charge your credit card even if the booking online does not go through. Fares published online are not really available they are just to bait you in. I booked a fare online and they sent me an email that it failed but went ahead and charged my credit card for it. Now I am having to work with my bank to stop the payment. I then called them and they lied to me that the other lower fare was not available and that I should book a higher fare as there were only 3 last seats left. Come to find out that it was all a lie. I amm now stuck with a higher fare ticket with 450$ cancellation fee per ticket. Caution!!!!,1

The pillow covers were torn and the Bed sheets were not washed. The break fast provided was only two Toasts and two cup of Tea .If that is the breakfast provided by your group. Then God may save customers. Its really shameful on the part of Management of Makemytrip.com that they charge high rates from the customers by giving Four star rating to their hotel & house boats. But the services r absolutely below standard even of one star category hotels. I contacted the management but they never bothered to reply. Any how I request Customers to give a second thought before booking with Make my Trip.com Portal.

3298,"AVOID these people at all cost. They booked my flight to India, gave me a confirmation number, and even charged my credit card. Then they later tell me that nothing was booked but my credit card was still charged. Now I am stuck having to pay a higher price (from another website) because it too close to the travel date. They have horrible customer service. After being on hold for a total of 2 hours they literally hung up on me. Didn’t say bye or or sorry just hung up on me.DO NOT USE THESE PEOPLE.FYI: I am not the only one this has happened to you. Search the internet and you will find other people with similar complaints. All these people want is your money and who knows what they are doing with your credit card info. If you look at there disclaimers on their websites they say that if you want to take any legal action upon them then you have to do it in India. That is a total joke. The legal system in India is so corrupt that nothing will ever get done and this company knows that. Even though they have an office in New York they are considered an international company.So be very cautious. They will take your money and give you nothing but a headache in return. Do not be taken by these people!!!",1

3300,Most incompetent and untrustworthy reservation web portal They display the fares which are not available with airlines directly Charge customer without confirming the reservation. Custome care executives are reluctant to refund your amount. Never call you back in time. You have to fight your own money. You call back and they always give you assurance to get the same tickets which everyone knows in India is impossible as apex fares are available for limied time. On escalation assure you of bearing self loss and getting the same reservations for customer. As the day of travel reaches nearer they will apologize and either give you a option which is not acceptable to you or take refund. Refund time is 10 days. Indian Railways is much more efficient than them. You receive alerts(email/sms) for the same reservations for which you have confirmed refund. I request Govt of India and AITA to take strcit actions against them. They are really violating credit card usage policies.,1
3301,I would request goverment to ban this organization from doing any business they do not have manners to talk or deal with customers. Specifically mr abhishek he should be thrown out of the organization. When you tell them that they have a huge rate difference they say bad words. What a organization. When you try to explain them that there is difference in the price and guide them to check they start blaming customers and abusing the customers and recommend them to visit other sites. This is the worst experience I had with this site. Earlier they used to care about the customers but now I think as if the organization is out of control and no one cares about the customers. I think they have forgot how to deal with customers. I am sure soon this organization will be closing down better visit other sites who atleast care about the customers and have courtesy of talking to customers properly.,1
3302,"I made SUCCESSFUL bookings for 2 nights (19th and 20th Sept) at Corbett Hide Away through “make my trip”. We started our journey from Delhi in the morning and when we were just about to reach our destination we got a call from Corbett Hide Away stating that there was NO room available and we should speak with makemytrip regarding this. They also gave us an option of making reservations at their sister property called “River View Retreat”.We tried explaining to them that our booking was confirmed (our confidence was backed by the printouts of the “confirmed booking” from makemytrip site) which was denied vehemently by the hotel corporate office. We were asked to contact makemytrip to resolve the matter. All this while we kept standing on the roadside in vain trying to grasp the initial shock. In that shocked state, stranded on the road we dialled the Make My Trip call center number After a hold of around 20 minutes; we finally did get a response from the executive (probably his name was Sushil) and this is what we get to hear: “I CAN REFUND ALL YOUR MONEY RIGHTAWAY” Having driven 5.5 hours from Delhi to our supposed holiday destination this is one response we definitely did not expect. Astound, we attempted explaining it to the executive that we have no place to go and we are actually helpless and in despair but he did not relent, his explanation: ""This is all I can do"". To our third shock and dismay the line was disconnected. We tried gathering ourselves and made a brave attempt. In anticipation of speaking to another courteous executive we again called the Make My Trip call center. After waiting for 15 minutes we were told that our request has been logged and we will hear from makmytrip in an hour or so. Having no choice we kept waiting on the road contemplating our alternatives. Finally we did get a call from a lady called Ms. Garima, who offered us a solution: Spend one night in “River View Retreat” and then shift to Hide Away the next day; she also mentioned reimbursing the balance amount since the costs were different in both properties; with NO other option & having been waiting on the road for an hour we decided to go with this. She said she will send out a mail confirming all of this which obviously never came. Differences between packages (2N/3D) offered by these 2 properties: Deluxe room at River view retreat: 7999 + taxes (all meals) Deluxe room at Hide Away: 9650 CP plan (only Break Fast) Little did we know that the ordeal wasn’t over yet, there was more in store. While checking out of the hotel we were presented a bill for all the meals in riverview (our first day stay). We were also not reimbursed any balance amount. All our arguments were met with: “Please speak to makemytrip regarding this”. However they were courteous enough to give us a 30% discount on the meals bill. We still kept our patience and on our way back encouraged ourselves to go through the rigorous process of approaching make trip.We spoke to a lady called Nandita. She promised she will get back to us in a few hours and she did.This time the response was different: “No reimbursements shall be made as the price in both properties is the same”- another shocker ! As you would probably imagine at about this point, frustration overtakes patience. Here I will cut short all the arguments I gave to Ms. Nandita in my defense and what followed after. I was finally put through to Ms. Arti who post her investigation (a hold time of 15 minutes again) had to politely tell me this: “Ms. Garima never communicated/committed that the difference will be reimbursed” “Anyways no reimbursements shall be made as the price in both properties is the same”- Realizing there was no point repeating my facts and arguing over the harassment we went through and we were being put through. BTW: But I did check with the hotel and they confirmed the difference in prices My entire trip of 5.5 hours was dedicated to making calls to makemytrip. I would also like to mention here that we were not in it alone. We happened to meet another poor fellow with family at the reception of River View Retreat trying to settle a similar GOOF UP by MakeMyTrip. Also after speaking to the hotel staff (the manager) at the reception we realized that “Hide Away” for 19th Sept’ was sold out much in advance, another shocker! And we grappled with the question in our minds: if that was the case how could MakeMyTrip confirm the rooms to us when they were not available in the first place? I am not sure if this is a “technical problem” as MakeMyTrip had to explain; but there is definitely something wrong somewhere in this specific case (still considering this as a SPECIFIC case). We do not expect money here but a customer friendly approach and better treatment.",1
3303,"I had booked my trip to India through MakeMyTrip.com. While booking my trip, I had provided my credit card Info in their website, and the entire charge was made to my credit card account. A day later I chatted online with the MakeMyTrip.com to make sure everything was Ok. I was told all reservations are confirmed and I am scheduled for the travel. On the day of travel, when I was about to check in, the airline informed me that my booking was cancelled, because the travel agent did not ticket my reservation. I called Makemytrip.com, and was on the phone for over 1 hour (luckily my phone had the charge). After 1 hour, they managed to ticket my one way reservation, but told me that the return journey had to be re-routed, that meant 3 connections for the return. It was a horrible experience dealing with them and all the time, it would take 20-30 minutes of hold time before I can get a representative online. They generally transfer calls to other personal and a call usually lasts more than an hour. Also, if you are in India, there is no hold facility, they just tell a message that all lines are busy, please call back later. It is a very frustating experience. If you can book a reservation through anyone else, please do so.",1

They ensured I would be receiving my E-ticket 3 business days after the payment cleared. The payment went through on the 21st and 3 business days later I did not recieve my E-ticket. As the day of my flight slowly approached (the 28th) and I received nothing except rude emails from MMT denying that my payment had gone through and insisting I contact my bank (which I did multiple times). My bank insisted the merchant (MMT) accepted the payment on the 21st. I don't know why MMT denied recieving the payment but it is either total incompetence or the work of a scam artist. Either way, Their company is horrible. Don't use them.",1

Being based in Mumbai, there would be too much of time & money to visit their office in Delhi avoid dealing with this agencyas after reading all the reviews, I think that they are trying to do business on our money.I also wish some consumer activist takes them on with RBI & IATA since both get involved due to the nature of online payment for air tickets",1

3308,"Add me to the long-list of the miserables who've used a Credit Card on MakeMyTrip.com & paid twice. On 16th June, I tried booking a ticket on Mumbai-Riyadh-Mumbai sector on makemytrip.com for 18th travel date. I was happy at the fares shown on makemytrip.com website as they were the cheapest. I was using a friend's (Mr Virendra K.)credit card trying to complete the booking. However, the site wouldn't take my booking citing problems with the credit card. Naturally, I gave up, But, soon as I received a call from their call centre (they must've gotten my details from the form I filled on their page). One Mr Avi Jain asked me why I abandoned purchase of the ticket & offered help. When I complained that the site was turning down the credit card, he asked us to try again. When that failed, I requested him to send me the ticket offline; I was willing to pay cash. He blocked the ticket & I was directed to their MIDC, Andheri office to pay in cash & collect the ticket the next day. I repeatedly enquired whether they'd still charged the Credit Card & he denied saying the transaction has not gone through. Since the fare was cheap, I dashed to their Andheri office the next day morning. I met one Ms Sangeeta Jadhav who completed the transaction & gave me my ticket for 18th June. Their booking ID is IN0906B04541 I was so enamored that I offered to send them a complimentary email for their good service, which I did.But, little did I know that my nightmare had just begun. When I came back from Riyadh, my friend called me to inform that makemytrip.com still charged the Credit Card with the full ticket amount. I was aghast. When I called Ms Sangeeta Jadhav in their Andheri office, she pointed out that this was routine system error & all I needed to do was send them a fax of the statement to reverse the charges. And then makemytrip.com's true colours started unfolding.I must've send 10 faxes, but on every call after that they claimed that no fax was received, inspite of we having a Fax sent confirmation. Then we sent the scan of the Credit Card statement. Again, none was received & whenever they received it, it was not opening. After too much pestering, their Gurgoan call centre asked to send the details now to their Gurgaon office. Again all the faxes sent were not received & their telephones just kept ringing away. I kept blasting away emails threatening to complain to consumer forums but nothing worked. All I kept getting was canned service emails repeatedly asking to send the statement scans again. Just on curiosity, I googled Makemytrip.com for consumer complaints & what do I find? They are notorious for this double-charging, snagging credit card details, cheating on refunds & what not! No wonder the consumer forum complaint threat did not work on them; this is their business model - double charge & loot whichever unsuspecting guy happens to give them their Credit Card details. Honestly, I don't know if I'll ever get back my money. The next credit card statement has come in with interest levied on their previous amount. I hope to get justice & money back. Also, I want to know if there is a way to punish & shut down fraud companies like MakeMyTrip.com.",1
3309,"I made a booking based on misleading reviews and 4.3 star ""user"" rating for a Hotel in Chennai. The glowing reviews for the hotel on makemytrip are fraudulent, and seem to have been written by makemytrip or hotel employees. The hotel was in a dirty neighborhood.

There is no apparent method to submit a review on this hotel in the makemytrip website.

Booked ticket and paid through debit card. Got many confirmation emails and sms on my mobile no, regarding tickets, receipt of payments etc. My mobile number was continuosly being updated regarding changes in flight timings / other updates through sms, which is an added benefit.

3313,"It was our Wedding Anniversary, therefore we decided to treat ourselves to a stay away from home. Unfortunately, it did not turn out to be quite as memorable as we had hoped! I had been intending to book directly with the Cidade de Goa, however, another hotel on MakeMyTrip's website seemed a better choice on the basis of the list of inclusions being apparently offered, only to find that the hotel would not accept them. In fact, our first shock was to find the hotel has no on-site parking. Their only parking is an empty lot outside the hotel grounds, which in the rains is mud filled and probably underwater when it rains(as it does at the moment). Our second(bigger) shock when we checked in was to discover that none of the inclusions mentioned by MakeMyTrip would be given as it was not the hotel policy! They told us to contact the Agent with whom we had made the booking. On calling MakeMyTrip, the toll free number would not work, we kept getting a ""call failed"" notice. We called their local Goa office but were told they could not deal with the issue and were given the mobile number of someone else who was responsible for online hotel bookings. We called this person, but while he promised to look into the matter and get back to me on my mobile or at the hotel, he never called us back! Email's to them since our stay have been ignored. The service we received was non-existent from MakeMyTrip and for them to advertise inclusions on a package which are not offered by the hotel is tantamount to fraud, especially when they charge you a Booking Fee to use their service!

Makemytrip charged my credit card INR 49 000. never refunded but stated by a company senior manager- ""you might be able to us the funds in the future if you take the same flight and book through Makemytrip then"" .WHAT! 3) Makemytrip booked outgoing flight on the 19th and return the 18th(Delhi-Mumbai-Delhi) . when I called and pointed out THEIR error they changed the return to right day but asked for cancelation charges and charged evein though I said NO. even though they admitted error was theirs. after taking actions the charge was paid back 4) Booked package for Kashmir . Makemytrip promised a lot - when confirmation came very very very less was confirmed . now only applying delaying tacktics to avoid to correct the problem .sales to management.sales guy run away . company not taking responsibility, . yes we are idiots who gave them so many opportunities to show good . now we take it to court . . now came back from Kashmir . well do you think we got what we were promised . NO .but thanks to great driver we got good holiday even if we ad to pay for what Makemy trip refused to pay to local rep in Kashmir what we paid to Makemytrip . so not only customers are cheated .also suppliers .fantastic .NO Get them out of business!

3315,"Make my trip sucks. Attractive prices offered, but in reality they charge you much more than other agents. This is my personal experience!! I traveled for more than $200-400 than my fellow passengers in similar situation!! So, these guys are not going to save you money, instead loot you. Beware!!! For example, I traveled for ~1400, and the others were traveling for ~1000 - ~1120, they also bought the tickets on the same date as that of mine. So, you can judge for yourself who is expensive and ""offering the deals""- infact these are cheating deals. Just to attract and get more customers. I won't use them to make another single trip to anywhere! It sucks, and they are also greedy people. It takes about 1-11/2 hours to book a trip over the phone. And that too, they have problems with the type of credit cards. My recommendation is always try for a good agent (local or a city), get these info from your friends and buy it from them. The message is - DO NOT USE makemytrip. Beware of these cheaters. They really SUCK - BIG TIME!!!!!",1

Then I checked online on the airline site and I found that the ticket is available at Rs 500 lesser there. When I called up the makemytrip person once more, he said he can't do anything. Then I told him that I would never do any booking with makemytrip again, he said he will check what he can do. He kept me on hold on the phone and didn't attend the call again. When the call reached some other agent, he transferred me to the same person, but he didn't pick up the call. Again it went to some other person and he told me that the person I was talking to has left for the day. I couldn't do anything and got charged Rs 1000 more for 2 tickets I had booked.

3317,"Like everyone, to save $50 or $100 bucks I used makemytrip and it was the worst experience. Prior to ticketing, I got an email from makemytrip outlining the terms. Couple of elements of the terms are a) date change penalty - $150 b) partially utilized ticket is non-refundable After ticketing, the email states the following terms for those two elements a) Date change penalty - $375 b) ticket is non-refundable I called makemytrip about the change of dates and they voided the terms prior to the ticketing and stuck to the terms after the tickets are confirmed. Upon pushing this furthrer, they asked me contact JetAirways and they pointed me to contact the travel agent. I called many times but the customer services is very poor where they really make it a worst experience.. by not returning phone call, email, don't provide the ability to talk with management (I tried few times but I was promised a call back but no call)... Few friends suggested that I disputet the transaction with my credit card and teh credit card company suggested me not to use this service while in dispute. Finally, I heard back my credit card company can't help me due makemytrip cancellation policy.. Now, I lost my tickets (9th June travel) and lost $1714 for an adult (two way ticket) and a child (one way ticket)..

3318,"Hi, we booked the ticket using one the Travel agent of MMT, around four months back. We got the confirm email and amount was charged on Credit card ( around US $ 2100 ). A day before the travel date , we got a phone call saying flight is not confirmed and they try to make us go using another date . That was so ridiculous. We had a plans for the trip and because of their mistake, we have to change the plan. This happen to me first time . I travelled more than 8-9 times ( India-USA ) We ignored silently their mistake for the first time. While coming back , my daughter was sick so we need to change the date. We paid extra $300 and got again confirmations from MMT. This was last week, Having all the confirm documents and reservation number , my wife and daughter went to Airport At that time they have been told that there is no reservations made for that date. After arguing , contacting MMT we have been told another stupid reason that credit card charge has been denied. I asked the bank and they say.. MMT does not submit proper information while charging to the bank. This is a well known bank ( CITI, Chase..)Again MMT told that us they will confirm the flight with in 2-3 days..I feel this is total rip off and fraud. I am going to consumer court and also filing lawsuit again this site . I have all the emails and names of the people from MakeMyTrip.com. We spent more than 12 hrs on phone while talking to Airlines and MMT. My recommendation is NEVER use this site for booking your tickets. Initially you may feel that its $50-$100 cheap, but in the end u will be rip off by their fraud charges and worst customer service",1
3319,"Ok I admit! it was the second time for me with make my trip. The first trip to Mauritius was pretty good! it was a gift to a very close couple! They loved it. So emboldened by this experience! I went for the biggest mistake of my life - booked a tour for my parents in law - called the Oriental Escape to Singapore and Malaysia in 2009. The costliest one on their menu! A nightmare thru and thru - the visa, ticket and the works arrive 2 days before departure! Because they want this trip to be a true Nightmare, and they dont want to ruin the Surprise! That was just the start, we truly understand the meaning of ""being taken for a ride"". Instead of the Malaysian Airlines, they chose Jet Airways - because they were trying to cut corners and save some dough.So instead of 5 hours trip to KL, the travel time including layover in Chennai was 12 GRUELLING HOURS! The trip was a connecting flight Chennai(did I mention my folks were going from Delhi). My Mom in Law hates flying.connecting flight means YOU CHANGE THE FLIGHT! in Chennai and do the immigration clearance in CHENNAI! As if it was not enough! every location they went to(KL, Genting, Singapore) they reached well before the ""check in"" time.(about 3-4 hours earlier). They were made to wait around by pointless sight seeing.instead of check in to save cost on the room rate! Now ideally Singapore should have been a flight trip from KL, instead another con job was a road trip of 5 hours in a BUS! Finally the nightmare was ending.atleast that is what we thought! THANKS TO THE CONNECTING FLIGHT FIASCO from Chennai! My folks arrived after losing their baggage and bore the hightened Customer UNService from Jet Airways! Who wanted them to report lost of baggage in a stamp paper of Rs. 20 in the Airport(if this were not my story, I would be on the floor laughing out Loud!, but be my guest and laught it up!) So in brief, RUN MILES AWAY but dont make a trip to Singapore Malaysia through make my trip.com. And whichever other provider you use, just verify the above issues dont crop up in your case.!

When I said the same to customer service he said some times website display fake availability and if I try to purchase my transaction would not be complete. I try to purchase the ticket online I got the confirmation number. after 15min, I received an email informing that they can not book the ticket due to communication failure. I spoke again with rep that I have received failure email he said it is because of not availability of the seats. after that I purchased ticket from some other agency. The second day I received e-ticket confirmation from makemytrip.com informing that my ticket is confirmed and they cut the money from my bank account. when I approach them they are saying that they are going to charge me for the cancellation. after sending the failure email I received they said they wont charge but the money will be refunded in 2months. I wasted so much time on phone with these people...they just want to take the money immediately and when it is return they are asking 2months that too they did the mistake...just think if you do the mistake what you have to suffer... I strongly suggest you think before you buy from these A..holes...",1
3322,"I got 2 tickets and wanted to change dates, I have already spent few hours. I reached a point when I said... here is how it works. it will take 20 min for someone to come on the phone. you give your info then wait for 2 to5 mins, answer few questions wait for 2 to 5 min.. Once you get mad waiting and getting frustrated. I asked them to refund my money and they say it takes 8 weeks for the money to come back to my account. (meanwhile, if you card is stollen or lost, then you can consider that money gone). I settled to get another ticket and then was told that the airline may not like the deal, so we wave to check with them... and I am still waiting.... I hope I get something out of this. With all this experience I think it is not working trying to save $100. it it better you go the airline site and buy your own ticket.",1
3323,"I had booked tickets for my family to travel to India in mid-Feb 2009, since one of passengers was an infant, she had to get paper tickets. The paper tickets was never dispatched to me inspite of faxing all the details to their NY # (I do have copies of fax and timings) and then a last minute mail request that came from them to send my address to dispatch the paper tickets. Till the day of our travel the customer support kept assuring me that the tickets have been dispatched , but on the day of travel when no ticket reached me, the customer service contact updated me that the tickets were never dispatched from their office and asked me to buy a infant ticket at the counter and promised that the entire ticket cost will be refunded by them. I paid close to $500+ to buy the ticket at the counter and faxed the copy of the ticket to them the very next day. Its now been 2.5 months and I have not received any refund yet. I have been calling them multiple number of times and all I hear is that their accounting dept is still working on the refund and they will send an update within 2 days. Now after 2.5 months of this pain they have the audacity to say that they will refund only $236 instead of the $500+ that I had paid for the ticket. I do not understand why they are not refunding me the entire amount when their team did not dispatch the ticket and fault was on their end. Even today (April30) when I called them they kept giving me the same update stating airlines need to confirm, accounting dept needs to update. Its been really very frustrating dealing with their customer service, they never give any info, do not keep to their promise on getting back with an update and their supervisor is never around when I wanted to escalate my issue. Have seen some comments here that refund was accelerated when there was a complaint in this forum, my reservation # is FUSINT20001020075 , I hope mine gets addressed as well.",2
3324,"Here's my story about MMT. i've done bookings with MMT and no issues. This thime however, after my experience have decided not to conduct any more business with MMT.com I was trying to do an International booking and the Credit card transaction did not go through. Boom...Immediately there was a call from MMT and the guy said he would process the payment and do the booking as they knew the transaction failed. Prompt enough to make the booking and said my credit card would be charged for X amount. While I questioned him to verify the exact dollar amount. he was promt enough to assure me that he would immediately send me a receipt (which I've never received untill today) 3 days later I found that my CC was charged 50 dollars more than the MMT personnel had told me. I sent them and email with the proof of my CC statement and detailing everything. NO Response. Then I tried calling them after a week and after 4 days I was finally able to speak to someone from the ""Service"" department and I repeated the whole story and he said he'll get back to me in 48 hours. This was about 3 weeks back. last week I called them and once again caught hold of one floor manager(that's what he claimed he was) and he assured me that he will get back to me in 72 hours. 4 days have past and still i've not yet heard from them. These guys are prompt enough to call us when the businees needs to be done and when it comes to customer service and that too the CC was over-charged and these guys dont even pick up calls or they get FRUSTRATED at us for calling them. There was one lady from MMT who directed me to the SERVICE department giving the usual 1800-INDIA-10 number to report this compliant. With such an attitude they are running this organisation. But one thing needs to be appreciated..they are very good in giving fake assurances that they'll get back to us in matter of hours....It's a matter of laughter...They need to be ashamed of such an attitude. I hope some body from MMT will read this posting..or may be someone forwards it to their founder & CEO Mr Deep Kalra. Let him know how his team is performing.Now that you've gone through my experience, Make your own judgement before you make a booking with MMT.com",1

3326,I recently took a Singapore trip from makemytrip and guess what I was told that I would get stay in 4 star plus hotel in Singapore i.e Barjaya. I had checked there review on mouthshout and called makemytrip twice and was told that it is wrong information on mouthshout and it is the best hotel in Singapore and on my arrival to Singapore to my horror it was the worst hotel in Singapore and above all it was in redlight district of Singapore. And best part is that I was charged much more then a normal 4 start hotel in Singapore would cost. That was not the end of the story we had even booked for cruise from them and onboard we came to know that the price charged by them for our cabin class is minimum two times higher. So pls don’t ever book from makemytrip they are the biggest cheat ever.,1

3329,I have had the worst experience with imint and makemytrip - I booked a hotel package early Dec 2008 through makemytrip - the package value was substantial. So I gave my imint number at the time of booking since then I have called them once and sent emails to them but they have still not reverted!! the last email they sent me was on Jan 7 asking for more information which I provided them. Subsequent follow-ups have gone unanswered - INEFFICIENT AND DISCOURTEOUS!! requests to provide the email id of their CEO have gone ignored - the call center refused to allow me to escalate the matter saying that they are not authorised to reveal any senior officials email ID which is shocking considering the front line does not solve problems and the senior management refuses to be bothered with customers!!! mails to makemytrip have also gone unacknoewledged. Completely ignored amazing how inefficient imint and makemytrip is - when I first sent them imint a mail there was no response for the mail - when I called them I was informed that they do not receive all mails sent since they have changed their server!! fair enough technical difficulties can happen - for subsequent emails I have a tracking id from them indicating that they have received the email but there is still no revert!!!! I refuse to call imint again - the one phone call I made lasted more than 20 minutes and was transferred from person to person absolutely disgusted with makemytrip - stay away from them - use services which offer real rewards (yatra.com’s rewards points and not cheats like makemytrip) and after everything I receive a call from makemytrip asking why I have sent them a mail stating I will never book thru makemytrip again..... a week after the call and despite repeating my story for the nth time my reward points are not yet credited.... makemytrip wants my imint number and imint wants my booking details - both are repeatedly mentioned in my emails to them - are u so uneducated that u cannot read a simple mail? funnily I receive an email from imint saying that the merchant (makemytrip) is not responsible since 60 days have lapsed since purchase - well u morons.... I have been following up with both prior to this golden 60 days and neither one of you morons were responsible then.... will someone senior from makemytrip or imint read this and wake up to the customer dissatisfaction that is being caused? or is ur business to cheat customers irrespective of the fact that they will never use you again? shockingly I get a call today asking for more details - despite repeatedly sending them details and following up some illiterate called tushar called up today saying he is there to help - I really cannot believe imints behaviour and of course makemytrip no longer bothers even responding - guess one customer less doesnt matter - nothing fazes them - customer support and service is not a word they understand - they continuously refuse to provide a senior's email ID - I guess imint management doesnt care for customers either - just like makemytrp doesnt - I look forward to the day both imint and makemytrip owners shut down - they deserve to be on the road with begging bowls given the customer support they provide,1
3330,"Ok, this is my story. I got this sms and mail talking of a discount on makemytrip. It said ""Return ticket at the cost of One-Way: Book an IndiGo Return ticket at the cost of a One-Way ticket*, only on MakeMyTip.com"". Since I travel very often on IndiGo wanted to check what the offer was all about. First, the language in the deal is extremely misleading. The actual deal is this- If you book a round trip of GoIndigo on makemytrip you will receive the lower of the two base fares only as a cashback 7-10 days after booking. Example (fictional):Hyd-Kol: Base Fare- Rs. 99. Taxes- Rs. 2600. Kol- Hyd: Base Fare- Rs.198. Taxes- Rs. 2500. Total cost: Rs. 5397. The offer means, you will need to pay the entire amount of Rs. 5397. Rs. 99 (which is the cheaper of the two base fares) will be refunded to your card as a cashback on a later date. This is bulland a case of gross bad messaging. Two, the offer terms and conditions were mentioned in the T&C page (which is on a different page outside of step 3-5) but throughout the 3-5 step online transaction while processing a ticket under the offer, they never mention the amount you ACTUALLY need to pay net (or the amount you will save/be discounted under the offer).An alert said the actual amount will be reflected in the payment confirmation page. While I tried to get to that page to understand the offer. I was asked to insert all my information- name, billing address, credit card information etc. Once that was done, not only was I taken to no credit-card-has-been-approved and/or xyz-amount-will-be-deducted-from-card-number-abc and/or confirmation page but was instead taken to a blank page with an error message saying""Connection stopped"" and almost immediately sent an SMS that said ""your booking has been confirmed"". Note, not once was there any confirmation required before they processed the transaction and billed it to my card. From my 3-4 years of regular online dealings be it wrt tomovie/airline/railway/online marketing purchases I have never come across such a fraudulent transaction ever. I tried to reason with officials at makemytrip on phone but not only was I kept on hold for20-22 mins each time on end but my appeal was completely disregarded.Customer care officer Saba Siddiqui (or she she said her name was) was downright impolite and unhelpful. The cancellation charges for a ticket I never booked is Rs. 2000. I give makemytrip a big thumbs down for deceptive messaging, poor site quality and poor customer service. I will never return to that portal and recommend that no one else does so too. I will blog and tweet @shaonrc about my poor experience and am happy to share my story with whoever else is interested. P.S:Price of tickets are always higher on makemytrip than on other portals as travelguru or cleartrip from my experience till date. They keep at least a 200-250 rupees commission per ticket. So if you book a round trip you pay at least 400-500 rupees extra.",1
3331,"Avoid makeMyTrip, Period. Why, you ask? Ok, I booked my travel with makeMyTrip and paid thru mycard. Near the completion of my stay at Cidade de Goa, it was by chancethat I saw their Jan-Mar offer. At their reception I simply computed myhotel charges only to find I was overcharged by at least Rs. 13, 000. Right there and then I spoke to the manager, he confirmed that mycalculation was correct. I also spoke with their agents in Delhi andthey too confirmed the amount. Then I asked the person in makeMyTrip. I wrote to her giving the entirecalculation. After few calls and few reminders, she acknowledged thatit was a ""mistake"" !! And reverted that amount!!! If I hadn't checked by chance, I would have never known about the overcharging of 13000/- What a way to cheat!!!I had then asked for flight charges details and the lady repeatedlytold me there is no problem there in flight charges. Only when I firmlysaid I was not asking for unnecessary information, she sent me theflight details. I have not yet been able to compute the fare. Avoid makeMyTrip.",1

3333,"I booked 2 international tickets through make my trip and for some reasons had to cancel them. While booking the ticket they told me the cancellation penalty is $300 per ticket, but when I actually cancelled the ticket, they told me that the penalty is $350 per ticket. After much fight when I understood that they will not help me, I accepted it and told them to at least REFUND the remaining amount after the penalty, Its been 3 months since and I have not received a single $ as refund. I have talked to Dhroov Pratap, Piyali Das, Maneesha & many more in their Customer Service and each person just tells me that your refund is on the WAY. Finally I asked my Credit card to dispute the charge. I am done with Make my Trip. Please be very cautious. Make My Trip is FRAUD.If you have been troubled by them in a similar way, just call up your Credit Card company and ask them to raise a dispute. They issue a credit immediately, plus they will black list this merchant in their database forever",1
3334,"I booked a ticket from Bangalore to Auckland via Hong Kong on Make my Trip on 5th Feb, 2009, for travel on 15th Feb 2009, and my credit card was charged for the full amount. Make my Trip sent a confirmation eMail with my itenary, also saying I would receive an e-ticket in 3 business days. 5 business days later, on 12th Feb, I called the customer service number because I was yet to receive the ticket. When I finally got through to an agent, I was informed that the ticket cannot be booked because that fare is no longer available. When I asked why we were not informed via email or phone, I was told that I had called in on the 6th of Feb and given this information, which is completely untrue. I have been on the phone from 1730 on 12th till 0152 on 13th, when I write this. I have spoken to 2 supervisors and 4 agents. I have been promised 2 callbacks, none of which I have received. My questions for Make my Trip: If I had called and was informed of ticket unavailability, why was the refund process not started? If the money on a card is blocked off before a ticket is confirmed, why does a refund process take 14 days as the supervisor Prasad told me? Why are there no supervisors on the call centre floor at 0156 in the morning as an agent informed me? It is only after the beginning of this ordeal that I googled this company, and find there are MANY similar stories, some at the link below. Use their services at your own risk! https://consumercomplaints.in/bycompany/make-my-trip-a15477.html",1
3335,"I am writing a very detailed, lengthy description so that people may understand what they should not do or what they should look out for. Apologies in advance! I recently booked tickets for Mumbai to Hyderabad using this makemytrip portal. At first I tried to book using an SBI debit card for Mumbai-Hyderabad, 5th Februray 2009 by Indigo airlines. After submitting all the details, the browser page came up with ""Internet explorer cannot find the page"". The refresh button resulted in the “webpage expired” message. I went back and tried to do the same transaction again and I kept on getting the message that ""Transaction failed"" everytime I clicked on ""continue with payment"" after selecting SBI debit card. I was puzzled (and the notification in red simply said ""Transaction failed"") and chose credit card (visa) and completed the transaction with Andhra Bank visa card. When I finished the transaction and chose to print the ticket, I found two bookings (identical) with same passenger names and same flightand two PNRs. In effect, what happened is that the debit card transaction that I tried first time apparently went through but I was not notified. Note this: On thesame flight,between thesame airports,on thesame date and time,two sets of **identical names with same address. *Incidentally, I have four mails sitting in my mailbox telling me that the transaction has failed and asking me to use a credit card or some other debit card. There is nothing about “you just used this card for a similar transaction.” So I immediately sent an email to their service centre, called up the service centre, and spoke to one Ms. Kanika. I told her about what happened. What followed is ridiculous. The reply I have been getting for the past six days has been this (at the call centre): We have received your mail. We at the call centre cannot do anything. Our technical team is working on it. Although we cannot help you, we can cancel one of the PNRs, and levy the cancellation penalty on you. If our technical team eventually finds that you are not lying, then we will refund the cancellation amount to you.  Here are the questions I have for the portal managers and also some observations: Would anyone, unless clinically insance, intentionally book two tickets on the same flight, between the same airports, on the same date and time, with identical names and address? I do not know of any bank that offers credit and debit cards to such people. How long does it take this so called technical team to see through such a small issue when it is apparent? They havenoteven replied asking a few questions if need be and verify any matters if they have any doubts. **Nothing at all. Does it really take six days to quickly look through and make a few quick verifications (if needed), and make a decision? One has to be really incompetent, disorganized or both to be so slow in an online business. *3. My own experience a year ago shows that they behave in a less-than-trustworthy manner when refunding the amount. Last year, my Air Deccan flight (booked through this portal) got cancelled by the airline, and the airline told me that makemytrip will refund my money since I booked through them. It took threee months for the refund to come through. I did not make a fuss at that time but this time I am fed up. I am of the firm view that this is a less than trustworthy operation, taking too long to refund money, and trying to keep some money by way of cancellation and future refund, citing the technical team. This is what we call managers hiding behind the skirts of the hapless call centre operators who, in the , have to deal with angry customers. My peeve is not about their mistake. Mistakes can happen on either side. What infuriates me is their obstinacy and unwillingness to be responsive, and I have no other conclusion than to agree with some of the observations on this site that they want to keep your money for sometime, or forever, if you give them a chance. For what it is worth, one piece of advice: Be extremely careful while using this portal. It may not always be a bad experience but if you make one innocuous mistake, they take you for a ride as if they have just been waiting for you to do that. They are not customer oriented, and they do not know what service is. I shall appreciate it if anyone here can advise me on (a) any governmental agency/ body with which I can formally lodge a complaint on such matters, and (b) any other action I can take.It is not the money now but just to make sure that people know about it and can avoid feeling miserable when dealing with such an unresponsive organization.",1

3337,"Hi, I recently booked a bus ticket from Delhi to Haridwar using makemytrip (PNR no: BUS50009110605754) for myself and my father (who is a senior citizen). I was shown the bus layout on the site and alloted seat nos 21 and 22 in a 2-by-2 bus being operated by Cityheart travels. I was hoping to have a comfortable journey by using the services of a reputed company. However, my experience turned out to be my worst nightmare. To begin with, the bus which was scheduled to leave at 11:00 AM actually started at 12:00 PM. To add insult to injury, the bus provided was no where close to what was shown on their website. The bus actually provided was an extended version of a mini-bus. There were no seat numbers, so much for the seat numbers allotted at the website. The leg space was shorter than perhaps even a low cost airline. And to top it all, the seats were non reclining. This was in total contrast to what I was made to believe at the website and I must say that I felt bitterly cheated. I used your site expecting a good service and comfortable journey for me and my father, but it was the worst journey I have even had. I understand that makemytrip may not have much control on how its partners deliver service and have also put a legal disclaimer in the ticket to that effect. But they cannot eschew the responsibility of the inconvenience caused to their customers as it is they who have chosen to partner with these vendors. Ultimately, after all its their brand image which gets severely impacted by every such incidence for which they spend crores and crores of rupees every year on advertising. I wonder if I will ever get to see a ethical company in India with genuine sensitivity towards the customer !! makemytrip is certainly miles away from being one.",1
3338,"I came across a lot of negative reviews for makemytrip on this website. But I had a fab experience with them. In fact, I am so happy with their timely response that I have spreading a good word about them to my friends. I had booked 3 rooms in a hotel in Hassan, Karnataka thru makemytrip online. The customer service agent(Ms.Garima Dhawan) called up within a couple of hours of my booking to confirm the same. After a few days, I called the hotel to check if they had received my booking. The hotel staff who received my call was not sure of it. So I wrote back to MMT asking for another confirmation. This time another agent called me back within an hour and gave me details of the manager of the hotel whom she spoke to and also consoled me that the booking was all taken care of. When I called the hotel back, they immediately replied in the positive. The hotel also was pretty decent with standard amenities and also value for money. All my family members were happy to stay at the hotel and I would recommed Hotel Sri Krishna to anybody who's looking for a budget as well as decent place to stay. Moreover, I got a sms from MMT the day I checked-out from the hotel inquiring about my stay and also to call them back if I had any concerns. It was an extremely caring gesture. I also got my hotel booking ID and voucher within the stipulated time. There was no delay in any follow up or communication whatsoever. I had booked a hotel thru MMT earlier too and I had no problem even then. My advice to all travellers booking hotels thru any travel portal would be to double check with the hotel before you start the journey. This way you will avoid rude shocks related to your booking later on. Cheers! Maya",4
3339,"I was to marry in a month’s time and needed an urgent honeymoon package. Since this was December, the whole world was booked for flights and accommodation. Also, prices for immediate booking was triple the normal rate. However, I saw a Kerela honeymoon package which promised a Suite at PAGODA RESORTS with a view of the famous alleppey backwaters, Kerala. We booked the package online and were refused any details in writing of the package as was discussed. When we reached there we were shown a 2 bedroom flat on the second floor of a building that overlooked some huts and a religious place of worship where prayers were blaring on loudspeakers. After losing one night and day begging non co-operative staff at MAKEMYTRIP and PAGODA RESORTS to put us into single occupant cottages below, they agreed. However they charged us for a day extra in the suite even though we checked out in time from the suite. The food at the resort was horrific and the backwaters were far, far away. The next few days were lost in pleading with MAKEMYTRIP and PAGODA RESORTS to refund us the right amount of money which they never did. Through this ordeal PAGODA RESORTS employees remained amused at our discomfort and it seemed like we were providing them with much needed entertainment. They also pretended not to understand English at specific times and also refused to listen to any request from us. They only did things as was told to them by MAKEMYTRIP. We finally left when I suffered from gastro and flew back to Bombay. Now I want to go for a real honeymoon with my wife.",1

3342,"I am a Sr Mgr with a leading IT company in India and had planned a vacation to Jaipur-Jodhpur-Jaisalmer via MMT.com and suffered badly. Here are my observations: I had booked a hotel - Laxmi Niwas in Jaipur via makemytrip. Hotel was rated 2. It was nothing more than a 1hotel and our 1 night stay there was pathetic. Such hotels are available in Jaipur for less than 1000 rs/room but makemytrip charged us 1500 for the room. I had booked a hotel for 2 nights for jodhpur and makemytrip provided me confirmed booking. Based on that, I made the travel arrangements. However, when I called the hotel to confirm, they denied any booking and also said that makemytrip did not provide them any intimation. I contacted makemytrip and then makemytrip cancelled the booking. Thus I I suffered a loss as I had already spent large amount on travel bookings. Apart from that, my travel plans were in jeopardy. For my final leg, I had booked a hotel - Classic Holidays in jaipur and again makemytrip passed off a 1* overpriced bad hotel as 3*. Hotel charged us 400 rs for a child and there were no additional service for the child, Hotel was so bad that they provided 1 paratha and 1 cup of tea in breakfast and when we asked for a refill, they refused. There was another group of guest to whom the hotel refused to give breakfast. I posted my feedback on makemytrip but they have suppressed my feedback. The classic holidays hotel appears as a 3.9* hotel to unsuspecting customers. I needed a date change to a hotel and spoke to the hotel, Hotel had rooms available and then I spoke to makemytrip. MMT asked me to send an email, which I did. However, no action was taken by mmt and when I again called them, they advised that I should have called instead of sending emails! However, the customer rep was good and after spending 45 mins on phone, she resolved the issue. I used a HSBC discount code and as per terms and conditions, mmt would credit back 7% of the amount in 5 business days. No amount has been credited and I am following up with makemytrip to get this completed. But overall., I would say that its best to stay away from them.",1
3343,"I recently booked hotels in manali and shimla based on the user feedback on the site makemytrip. But when I reached shimla, I found the hotel is worst. I submitted my feedback to makemytrip, but they never posted it online. I complaint to the customer care also about it, but they also never cared, as they get huge commissions from that hotel, so they deliberated changed the rating and generated ficious reviews about that hotel. Never use this website to do any hotel booking. Also I found that the nearby hotels are charging half the price for the same service.Also they keep spamming the mailbox, out of office mails. Why do I bother they are in office or not, I didn't emailed them. I filled the webform which is being emailed to n number of peoples, all worst and do nothing about it.Also I submitted the review for the hotel in Manali, they never published it also.",1
3344,"Makemytrip.com has been advertising in US on Indian channels and I thought of giving it a try as their fares to India looked good to me. I decided to go online and book the tickets. After giving the credit card number, I realized that the site gave me tickets for wrong dates then I had asked for. Within minutes, I called the tollfree number in US and asked them to cancel the ticket right away. When I did so, I came to know the call was going to India and the person on the phone told me that my credit card was not charged and a request was sent on the system for a cancellation which apparantly needed an approval from higher up and promised it would be done by Monday as the office was closed for the day. Not sure of their promise, I notified the credit card company almost at the same time and indicated that the situation does not look good. They took and note and asked me to wait until and if the the charges came through on the credit card. After several calls and conversation with Makemytrip.com through the weekend, I failed to get a confirmation e-mail of cancellation. On Monday I was told, the ticket is bought and can not be changed without a fine of$600 each. Eventually when charges came through, I filed a dispute claim with credit card company that refunded me all the money right away. However during the time of dispute, I felt like I am being manipulated and cheated by makemytrip.com. I have been in US for 20 years and had never experienced any customer service like this. Never again Makemytrip.com! Thanks to my credit card company for taking care of this dispute!Please be very careful, and wanred specially for anyone going to this site from within US.",1
3345,"These guys are cheats /fraudsters to the core their main aim is to cheat consumers by offerring travel / stay vouchers which anyway cannot be fully utilized because of the hidden clauses and terms / conditions. Boycott the website for any travel bookings and avoid getting a free / paid travel vouchers from the website. I had rs 30k vouchers wasted because of their utter lack of consumer service. Try to book tickets using them its a herculean task. Firstly, you cannot book online, secondly even if you are ready to use the call-in service, not only do they charge you rs 250 for lousy service (which they don't mention in the face of the voucher, effectively reducing overall value of the voucher by 2.5%) but the main aim is to make only the least amount booking against the voucher. As even if the airline tickets are refundable. They don't revalidate the vouchers. Buyer beware, don't ever dare to buy travel vouchers from make my trip for any of your travel requirements. Am also filing a separate consumer complaint against the website for false assurances and hidden agreements.",1
3346,"We had gone to Udaipur with family (Me, my wife, my in laws & my bother in law with his familiy. We had booked the hotel for 3 day and two nights. and was told that the charges MMT takes is marginal i.e. Rs 250 only. Which turned out to be Rs 250 per head per day..! The hotel which we booked was rated 3 star by make my trip. It was for sure was not a 3 star hotel but was an ordinary hotel. The hotel worked fine for reason being Udaipur a tourist place. Other wise the reviews that make my trip gives are absolutely worth less. Never trust them for this. I will recommend that one should get the reservations done from the website of Hotels. Review hotels from  and book from their websites or desk. Do not use mmt or yatra or cleartrip.",1
3347,"I too would like to share my worst experiences with this makemytrip.com. I think no one should ever try and do any business with them. Let me narrate my three unpleasant experiences with them. I booked a flight ticket from Mumbai to Hyderabad one month in advance. When I selected my fllight and was taken to the payment gateway ccavenues.com. I paid the required amount through my net banking website. After that nothing happened, and site page went blank. I sent them a mail explaining the problem. After three days, they came back saying that there was a techhical error and all my booking details have been lost. They advised me to give all details of booking so that they will book again. Again it took almost a week for them to come back and send me a ticket. Meanwhile, I was restless without any proper response from them having paid for the ticket. They said, by using this ticket booking reference, I can avail a discount of Rs. 1000/- if I make a hotel booking through their website. I was going to Shirdi so I made a booking for a hotel in Shirdi, Hotel Saish. Everything about the hotel on their website was great. To my horror, when I reached this hotel, I found it is very dirty and poorly maintained. The bath room was dirty, the room was dirty and the sheets were so dirty and had lots of stains on them. The air conditioner had seen better days. It is not certainly worhy of Rs. 2000/- daily charge for the room. We couldnt just sleep on those beds. I wrote a strong letter of protest and all they said was that they will convey this to the hotel concerned instead of straightaway removing that hotel from their website. Again on the third time, I booked a hotel in Mumbai through their website. The same drama went again. AFter making payment through my net banking site, the page went blank. This time, I didnt have enough time also. I frantically sent them mails saying that payment is already debited to my bank account and their collecting website (ccavenues.com) have sent me a mail confirming receipt of payment. They replied after three days, that there was a technical error and they couldnt trace any details. I sent them mails sent to me from ccavenues.com and also the mail sent to me by my bank debiting my acccount. There was no reply and time was running out. I called them on their toll free line and was online for one hour and some customer service manager says, he will work on it and would come back to me. After several mails and messages, finally I got a mail from them (I was to travel next day, no hotel booking confirmed) saying that they cannot do anytihng about this and that they will refund my money in 7 days. It is already more than 7 days and I havent received any payment. All this after a lot of harassment and frantic phone calls. They had the temerity to suggest that I should make another booking through their website and pay again!!1 All the above three experiences have really rattled me and I recommend to everyone never to deal with this makemytrip.com and get into trouble. I was dealing with one Mr. Gur Simran who promises everything but does nothing.",1
3348,"I had booked to Alleppey Beach Resort on 20th by Aman at https://makemytrip.com thru my Citibank Credit card for 27th to 29th noon. On being told that the resort is good, I booked for an additional day the same eveing and extended my stay to 30th thru Parvesh and my credit card was charged Rs.2329/-(voucher no - IN0812B04364) I am now at the resort where the hotel staff say that they havent recd the booking amount for 29th to 30th and dont have any rooms available When I called your customer care at makemytrip, there is no proper communication and I am asked to wait for another 24 hours since the concerned peole are not there. They neither want to refund of my last booking amount since the room is unavailable or confirm the same booking as they have already charged With such a harrowing experience, this is a such a miserable trip. I dont think I will use thier service or recommend anyone to book in future",1
3349,"Customer service is pathetic. I have listen about this website so I thought that I must try it but when I tried it and I found that there is no customer service. They doesn't provide any service. Yesterday I was trying to book the tickets. Loading time of website was gud but due to some technical error it doesn't go through. They called me up after 20 min. At that time I was busy talking to my mom on other phone so I told them to call me after 10 min but till next 24 hrs there was no call from there side. So I booked my tkts from elsewhere.... Frankly speaking the service that they are providing is very bad. Atleast they must have called me up ... In future, I will never book my tickets from make my trip. Now I am expecting that they must call me up next year.",1
3350,"Don't book your hotels through make my trip otherwise your trip will get spoilt. Recently we went to munnar and unfortunately booked our hotel through makemytrip.com. Pictures of hotels and facilities available on this site are fake and reality is no where near to what is described in hotel description. And ratings given to the hotel are nonsense. In fact hotel person can fight with you or disconnect your phone if you keep calling for service. And don't think its cheap its not at all cheap. No services in hotel no standard room. Infact by booking your hotel through makemytrip you get badly trapped with a worst kind of hotel, and your visit will become torturous. Its better to keep list of hotels with you and phone booking than to book through makemytrip otherwise your trip will be spoilt. I am sharing my personal and honest experience so that nobody else's trip (who come across with the review) get spoilt.",1
3351,"I had worked in MakeMyTrip for 2 years and I feel that its a good organization to work. As every company has few positive points and few negative points. Here are the positive points which I feel and should be in every organization: Good Infrastructure facilities except good lunch. They increase your efficiency through regular trainings. Hats off to training team. I learned alot. All work is divided and everyone knows who is responsible for what. Flexi working hours. Every festival is celebrated with full spirit. 1 team lunch every month. Free Offsite once in a year. All CXOs are highly experienced and down to earth, they keep on motivating employees and regularly talk to employees. even they eat there lunch with staff. Here are few negative issues in the company which I feel should be solved: Flow of work from 1 team to another is too slow. Lots of politics is played inside the organization. There are more team leader and less team members. In technology team there are 5-6 AVPs, 6-7 Managers, 9-10 are of AM level and team members are around 15-20 only. Current Location of corporate office is not at all a good location for the staff. There you hardly get something to eat. And lunch provided in the company is totally of inconsistant quality(sometimes too good and sometimes too bad). In all its a good organization is a good place to work and even to grow your career. Everyday you are going to learn something new. Well I leave MakeMyTrip for my personal problems. If again I got the chance to serve my services to MakeMyTrip then I will not think twice.",3
3352,"This is the worst service I ever received. They booked my ticket from NYC to HYD and charged my credit card but never issued the tickets. After calling them I came to know one of my sectors is not confirmed and thats the reason they are not issuing my ticket. I waited for a month and they couldn't confirm my reservation. Everytime I call them they say they are working on it, but nothing happens. I am within 2 weeks of my travel, so I got frustrated and cancelled my tickets and bought them with priceline for$400 more. Never ever book your flight with these people if you want to have confirmed tickets and peace of mind. They are just Aole's who do anything for money and play with customers. Also try getting to speak with a manager or supervisor, you can never get them. What can you do if they say there are no tickets available on your date of travel inthe last minute, all your travel plans are scrd up. So never trust them with your travel needs.",1
3353,"I booked an international ticket to India from USA on October 28th 2008 and immediately got a confirmation email within 24 hrs timeframe. However, it too several repeated phone calls, emails and online chats and was then only able to get the actual E-ticket numbers on Nov 8th 2008. If you have a confirmed reservation with booking number or PNR number that's still not considered reserved until you have the E-Ticket number.... MakeMyTrip customer service needs to be improved and customer response time should not be more than couple of hours or at a day at the maximum. Most often, when I call, I was told we'll get back to you within 24 hrs and nothing happens and then you make a call and then additional time is needed. MakeMyTrip did not make any effort to call me or email to let me know that my Itinerary has been confirmed but it has not yet been ticketed.... After you book tickets with MakeMyTrip, please make sure you have E-Ticket numbers with you......",2
3354,"MMT is very very good. Recently I had to cancel my Flight and Hotel bookings due to change in trip plans. I canceled flight online and called MMT for Hotel Cancellation. They took the request and called me next day for clarification and they told amount will be refunded in next 10 days. I got refund for Flight in 6 days and for Hotel I had to call for just 3 times since I did not get the confirmation mail from them. I got the refund in 8 days after the cancellation. Customer service is very good via phone but email they should improve since no one seems to reading the mails. Anyway, I like the service and one my colleague booked hotel and he is happy with the service! I want to use MMT for all my future plans. I read most of the reviews and found that none of them have recommended. It seems they improved the service and they are doing well now. Thanks, Manjunath",5
3355,"On 4th Sept 2008, I was trying to book an air-ticket from my friend's credit card belonging to Tarun Mahajan) but https://makemytrip.com website did not accept this card. Hence, I got the ticket booked from my credit card belonging to Munish Mittal) on the same day i.e. 4th Sept 2008. The details of the ticket booked are given below: FLTAFF000522463190 Indigo #334 Now what has happened is that the ticket amount of Rs. 9850.00 has been debited from my account as well as Mr. Tarun Mahajan's account. I came to know about the double debit around a week ago when Tarun and I received our credit card statements. After that I spoke to one of the customer care executives (i guess name was Manisha) and expalined her everything. she asked me to route the complaint through service@makemytrip.com . since then I have been following with Mr. Sindhu (Sr. Executive) at https://makemytrip.com but have not got any positive response. I have also emailed the credit card statements of both Tarun Mahajan and mine but still haven't got any response. There is not even a single option to escalate the complaint, you have to bang your head through the same route i.e. through email id service@makemytrip.com If in case any Make My Trip official reads this review, please check so that I can get the refund of Rs. 9850.00 which have been charged extra to me.",1
3356,"The conservative Sajith  I am an orthodox guy who always prefer to go to airport, stand in the que and purchase ticket from the counter. I was very happy but I was viewed with suspicion by many - yeah - peer pressure - ""You never attempted online booking???? "" ""You are living in this century but acting as a morbid man"", ""Why so conservative?"" Fine - enough is enough. I thought of trying make my trip. Twice I travelled with out much trouble even if I have to remind them twice for the tickets to be sent to my email address so that I can claim reimbursement. But some thing happened during the olympic day was beyond my imagination! I have to travel to Trivandrum from Mumbai on the magic date 8/8/2008 as I have to attend a function. At any cost, I cannot afford to cancel the trip. I thought of trying Makemytrip as I was looking for some discount. Sajith with out Surname  3/8/2008 I dialled their office by arounf 3.30 AM and Ms. Poonam Chaudhari attended the call. After initial ice breaking dialogues, I have chosen Jetairways and she started with the booking prcocees. Poonam : ""Please telle me your name"" Sajith : ""Sajith S"" Poonam : ""What is your surname?""( God - this is the question I am always afaid of - as I dont have a surname but only an initial which is the ""style"" of Keralites. Some history for the sake of all non keralites who wonder why we dont have surnames. Yeah - we have proper father and mother. According to the old caste system prevailing in kerala, only upper cast people used to have surname and lower cast people where not having any surname. And after the social revolution, progressive upper cast people also started denouncing their surname so that with the name, no one shall be categorised as upper caste or lower caste. Well, my father was also one progressive person who benovolently decided that the beautiful surnameNairshall not be included as part of my name. Hence, I am Sajith S means, Sajith Sasidharan Nair. And in Pune, none of the local software accepted the odd name with out surname. So friends - next time please excuse a mallu with out surname - he represent a great legacy) Sajith - Sorry Madam. No surname, but you can use ""S"" as my surname as it is the shortform of my fathers name ( No point in educating her on the social system in Kerala) She tried for some time and said ""Sorry, the software do not accept the booking with a single alphabet surname. So, please find one more alphabet along with this"" I never faced such a situation beforr with makemytrip. To find a new surname will amount to change my dad!!! Crazy. I told her ""Madam, sorry - I have one father, one surname. And all these days I lived with this. Even makekytrip booked me tickets before with this name. What is your problem?"" She was a bit annoyed and after some time she told me - ok, I will put a dot after S and solve the problem. Vowww - she is so innovative.And I have to tell her my credit card number 5 times as she made mistake while noting it down. I was frustrated and told her ""Madam, you have problem with my name, my surname, my credit card and everything related to mine. So, how can I be sure that you booked tickets for me"" She kept me in waiting for solid 13 minutes and I cannot even disconnect the phone as I have give my card details. Finally, she confirmed ticket is booked and I will get the ticket through mail next day. She gave me a booking id. God, I am relieved. My adventures with Makemytrip After two days, I casually remembered that I didnot get my tickets. But my friends who always gave me confidence that if booking id is given then I dont have to worry had gone to my mind and I never gave a second thought. But on 6th morning also when I didnot get my ticket, I thought of  enquiring Jet Airways Office and was shocked to note that my tickets were blocked but payment was not released and hence the ticket was not issued. I lost my cool and ringed them again. Ms. Nancy Bedi attended the call this time. She gave me the most fantastic information""Sir, your tickets are not booked. This id you are giving states that it is kept pending. So, if you wish, I can book the tickets"" I feel like dropping a nuclear bomb to her head and told ""You dont do anything. Just cancel my tickets"" Nancy ""Ok but you will lose Rs.1000/- towards cancellation"" Sajith : ""Why should I pay money for a ticket which is never booked?"" Nancy: ""It is not booked but it is bloced"" - ME BEING AN ORDINARY PERSON DIDNOT UNDERSTAND HEAD AND TAIL OF THIS. SHE KEPT ME ON HOLD FOR 20 MINUTES ------ AND IN THE MEAN TIME USING ANOTHER PHONE I BOOKED TICKET THORUGH JET AIRWAYS AS ONLY THREE MORE TICKETS WERE AVAILABLE. I CANNOT AFFORD TO CANCLE THE TRIP. Some thing quite amazing happened and the lady on the other side came back on the line after 20 minutes and told me ""Mr. Sajith, I am sorry your tickets were booked already but due to some system issue here, we could not forward the request to jet airways. We just cleared the same and your ticket is booked. Your invoice number is IN0808B00368"" What the hell is this? Who on earth gave them confirmation to book tickets? I asked them to cancel only. As I cannot trust them, I have booked ticket when these idiots kept me on que for long hours. CUSTOMER IS BEGGAR NOW - HE ENDS UP WITH TWO TICKETS AND THEY WILL CANCEL THE SAME ONLY IF I PAY THE CANCELLATION FEE. TO RECITE THE ENTIRE STORY TO HER DOES NOT MADE ANY DIFFERENCE Later -- The summary of events I spoke to the old Poonam but she told me that Ms. Nancy gave me wrong information. She cannot do anything but I have to pay money She refuesed to escalate the matter I spoke to Mr.Sunny Gulati another executive who was a bit sensible and took my request to cancel the ticket and not to charge me any single penny as it was their fault I wrote a detailed mail to him stating this On 7th night I got a mail stating that my tickets are cancelled and they have not charged any money from my side and their apology for inconvenicne Lesson - Never go for a mode where in you have to discolsoe your credit card number and cvv number over phone. Go for booking either through online transaction or through the direct booking facility of the offices of the operators Make it sure that you always track your trasactions on a routine basis If you dont have ticket in your hand - never ever hesitate to get the same becuase otherwise you will land up in trouble Make it a habit to write email to the service providers which will help you ( I have done this and hence could give details of all transactions) Thanks for your time.",1

I can give the booking id which I have done with makemytrip.com if anybody think this is a fake. My Booking Id is HTL160190. I am very frustrated because of this if anyone knows how to file the case in consumer court regarding this fraud help me out.",1
3359,"I am vimal jain from visakhapatnam, I have recently come across the unusal happening and MAKEMYTRIP.com, where they claim that ISSE SASTA AUR KAHI NAHI. I have tried making an air ticket with the site, and I have paid 5224 towards the airticket booking from Vizag to Bangalore for 17 sep, and on confirmation I have got the PNR for my Paramount Airlines, when I have visited that site to take my ticket print out, if found that the amount in total is showing as 4924, so there is a difference of 300 Rs. And when I called up MMT, they said that these are some charges which they collect but not the airline, but my question is here when the agency is issuing a ticket so he will add the charges on the ticket, why it is not done, and when the agency has charged some amount, that same amount should be with the airline too, why there I a difference, And while talking they are rudly behaving over this and telling me that I am free to complain where ever I need to. So here I would like to say that what is the point in saying that ISSE SASTA AUR KAHI NAHI. when the same is getting for less in the airlines.",2
3360,"Don't go for MakeMytrip. Rest are at least a little better Latest Experience with them: I made a booking last month on Makemytrip. It was areturn ticket from Delhi to Kathmandu(6th June going and 8th junereturn). I got to know from someone that the flight for 8th of June hasbeen cancelled and when I enquired from makemytrip's customer care on phonethey infromed me that my ticket has been shifted to 9th of June. They didn't even bothered to call me and inform me about change in the travel date.Then I asked that person to cancel my travel as this new option is not acceptable to me and refund me my whole money.He said he doesn't know the rules of the airline and will update me in24 hours. I asked him to give me some query or complaint number so thatnext tie again I don't have to tell all the things again. He told methat he has already updated all the details with my booking ID so thereis no need for any complaint number. I didn't got any response and then I called their customer care again and they said they do not have any informationwith them for my query. Then I told my story again and again it was asame response that they don't know the cancellation rules of RoyalNepal Airlines so will be able to provide details to me only after 2-3 days.When I asked her to register my complaint she again told me the samething that I have put everything in your booking ID so no need for anycomplaint number. When I insisted on it for long then she agreed to itand povided me the query number. Now I am waiting for there reply which I am sure will never come. After every 30 seconds they will put you on hold for 4-5 minutes and even then they will not come with any concrete data due to which they will again put you on hold and it continues and in the last they will tell we don't and will update you in next 24 hours and will never revert. Last Experience with MakeMyTrip: 14th of august I made hotel bookings on make my trip. It was a booking on request and I was informed that with in 3 business hours I will get the status update and if they fail to do so they will provide me 1000 Rs off on my next booking through them. They didn't reverted back till evening I called them and got response they are looking into the request, waiting for a positive request I booked a cab also. In the evening when again I called them and they told that booking was not done. I had to pay my cab driver 800 Rs without even using it. Then I tried contacting makemytrip for there promise which they made(Rs 1000 off on next booking if they fail to update the status in 3 business hours) but no one replied to my mails. I called customer care then they informed we need to look into the matter and will call you back. Till today I have made more than 6 calls and sent atleast 8 mails to them and haven't got any proper response. I will recommend not to go by there words and promises. Book from them only in the cases when you do not have any other good option. In any case if it is must to book from them then book only if the booking is direct and confirmed. In short and simple words AVOID makemytrip.",1

3363,"Beware while booking hotels from makeMyTrip. Their ""recommended"" hotels are recommended based on god -knows-what(perhaps on the commissions they get from the hotel). I asked for hotels in Shimla and 4-star lists Shilon Resort, Shimla is listed as 4-star. Only catch is that makeMyTrip site does not list that Shilon resort is not in Shimla town but it is 27 kms away beyond Kufri ! And boy, what a catch it is. Because if you are going to Shimla, you want to ""see"" shimla, not ""drive by Shimla"" and more so, because, unlike kalka-shimla road, the chail-kufri road is very narrow and quite risky for a first timer. A drive on that kind of road for 27 kms would easily be like driving 90 kms on plains, only with more huge risk. On top of this, when I called up to book the lady on phone also never told me that it is so far off. She happily booked it. On reaching Shimla and finding the scary road and scarier distance far far away from Shimla to Shilon Resort, when I asked makeMyTrip to cancel my booking, predictably, their reply was ""it cannot be canceled now"". The lady on phone kept lying that she had told me it is 27 kms away. Am I a nerd to go to Shimla for seeing Shimla but stay 27 kms beyond it! Obviously they had got their commission, their remote hotel was happy with the money so it was not possible for them to cancel.  Luckily for me, I did not get stranded because Cecil Oberoi came to rescue and gave me a room for my vacation. Well, I will never ever book any trips thru makeMyTrip. It must be renamed as ""screwMyTrip"".",1
3364,"I would like to inform the users reading my review of one thing: After posting this, I managed to get past the customer care (some how found some one who knew some one in MMT), the issues was promptly resolved and I was issued new (and CHEAPER !! and BETTER !!) tickets in the next two days. So I would still say that MMT has the worst call center operatons ever (but I have not liked call center guys any ways, they do not know any thing and can never help you), I would retract from the over all image of mine that MMT-Is-All-Bad. But, they can be better !! Read the incident now. (updated 12th Aug-2008)  (the incident part was written below on 30th July 2008) The site is the worst ever. I thought that they would be good, because they seem to be having some what better (and more updated) fares than other travel sites ... orbitz for example. But when I ended up booking the tickets it was a disaster. Recently I booked a ticket on MMT. My Issue has been that they charged me money for a itinerary from BOM-HKG (17th Aug night) and HKG-JKF(21st Aug 08). But, the site said invalid booking umber. For the past 8 days I have been calling them and everytime I get the same ""We will call back within 2 hours"". Never got a true call back, taht resoved anything... All the callbacks (more than 15 already) started with me re-iterating my problem and then ended with a) there is some operational error. Wee will call back b) the ticket has not been confirmed by the airline. We will call back c) There is a problem with teh accounts. We will call back. d) The ticket has been cancelled (:-o .. this was a strange one)... when I said it is not possible, he immidiately stepped back and said  We will call back e) Once, one of the call center guys sent me a mail that had BOM-HKG(17th Aug morning) and no flight HKG - JFK. Now how can you change the flight... so they said it is probably a tech error, we will call back. f) After the above scene, I really frantic, so I did get a call back, immidiately, when they said "" we will some how get you tickets. do not worry sir. we will get back in a couple of hours"" g) Sir, we are from the mumbai office. All major issues are handled by teh delhi office. I will make sire they call you by evening tonight. So. I think all MMT does is cal back to make anotehr promise of a call back. No One actually has any idea about the problem of the person who booked the tickets, all they are worried is how to arrange for more call backs so the call center guys are kept busy... STRANGE !! Regards, Pranshu Sharma",2
3365,"Should have read all the reviews here before making my booking my trip with makemytrip.com. I made a hotel booking and everything was OK till I received my credit card statement. I was charged three times for the same transaction. Repeated mails and calls resulted in one transaction being reversed. I am still struggling after months to reverse the third transaction. Mails go unanswered, phone calls are kept on hold for 15 - 20 minutes and then disconnected. If you happen to reach somebody, a call back is promised and then nothing happens. I get absolutely no feedback. Dont know if atleast they are working on this. From the other reviews that I have read, seems like I will have to wait for atleast a few more months calling and following up! So that was the last time I am going to do anything with makemytrip.com. Not worth all the time and effort which will take away anything that one may have gained out a holiday",2
3366,"This is in reference with our conversation regarding a little trouble that I am facing with Make My Trip. This is in reference with my booking ID: IN0804B04207. I had booked two return tickets on Deccan Airways for Delhi to Leh (2 May) and From Leh to Delhi in Deccan Airways (5th May) through makemytrip. Our return flight got cancelled and hence I had to cancel my ticket. I was informed at the Airport that makemytrip would be refunding the cancellation money to me. After I returned, on 6th May, I spoke to makemytrip representative Swati Babbar, who gave me a landline number, to put in my request for refund. I tried that number for one week but no one answered the call, I believe that is number which is given to the customer just to fool around. On 10th May, I traveled all the way to their Gurgaon office where the receptionist introduced to an executive Gayatri, who again had no answer for me and I was returned saying someone would get in touch with me in next one hour. Infact when I told the receptionist that nobody was taking call on that number given to me, she was not shocked, it seemed that she was aware that no body answers that number. Till 16th May, nobody from Make My Trip contacted me for the same, I then tried calling the number through which you can book ticket with Makemytrip where I explained my problem to one of their executive and he then informed that our refund would reach us in next 10 days. Its more than 15 days now and we have not yet received any communication from their end to inform what the update on the same is. With this experience, I have realized that makemytrip.com do not have a strong process in place for refunds and they have no resource for consumer redressal, I think they need to take a stalk of the things immediately and work accordingly to improve the process. I would like to request if you could help me out as I have failed to get any answer from them, .",2
3367,"This is regarding my refund for the Paramount flight which I booked through MakeMy Trip. Its been more than 2 months now & I still do not have my refund for the cancelled flight! I must applaud MakemyTrip & Paramount for their BAD service! Each do not feel the responsibility to return their customer's own money! The Paramount Flight was cancelled at the last moment due to which I faced enough problems trying to book another flight. Anyways, Paramount took 1 month(after repeated reminders, through phone & emails) to refund my money for the cancelled flight to MakeMy Trip & MakeMyTrip doesnt even feel the need to return that money to my credit card! Its been more than 2 months now! Pathetic combination of travel - is all that I have to say! Calling up MakeMytrip puts the customer on hold forever, why is there even a number for customer care? The customer care service for Makemytrip is the worst Ive ever seen & I'll make sure I, my family, my friends & my colleagues will never repeat this mistake by booking through makemytrip. Finally, this comes to ask Makemy Trip customer care - Do you even intend to return my money or not? Or is ths how MakeMyTrip earns extra money - by never refunding the customer's money?",1
3368,"Makemytripseems to have deployed a policy of not refunding cancellation dues or to deliberately delay payments for months. The cancellation is not considered unless customer makes repeated calls.  It all seems to be done to earn illegitimate interest on Crores they are supposed to return to lakhs of such cases. Someone out there from regulators and Govt. must proceed with criminal actions on these websites. I am personally referring to cancellation of my tickets which was booked on February 25th 2008(**FLT 1278895**). I had immediately got done that cancelled thru Jet Airlines directly and then thru makemytrip also. On enquiry, I was promised that refund would be reaching me in 10 days. It is three months now and I am awaiting any thing from them. When I spoke to them on phone they have no answer to the delay and have only promise that it would be done soon. My request is to avoid this website for bookings in future.",1
3369,"I booked a trip to Australia with Austravel August 2007.  Leaving Ireland our visas weren't on our passports!!  Only I had a receipt to say I paid them we were in trouble!! It was Austravels job to make sure these visas were on our passports. We landed in Sydney after a stop over in Abu Dhabi, got married in Sydney, stayed 3 night in a hotel in Sydney, flew to Cairns and hired a campervan to travel back to Sydney and stay one night in Sydney hotel. Austravel were to org everything except the flight to sydney return.  They booked everything wrong! I asked them to see if we had accommodation with our airline in Abu Dhabi, they never checked for me so we paid extra for taxis and a hotel even though our airline was providing all this free.  They booked the hotel in Abu Dhabi for the wrong night.  Luckily they werent booked up. There was no bed in the hotel room in Sydney for our son.  We got married in the botanic gardens and the expensive photographer was awful, our pictures are terrible!! even the aud$500 we paid for the wedding album was a rip off because it is falling apart!! We went to get our flight to Cairns and was told we weren't booked on it.  Austravel had booked it for the same day the wedding was on!!!  We had to pay aud$900 for a flight we were lucky to get seats on! We arrived in Cairns to collect our campervan and was told it was for collection in Brisbane!!  Luckily after waiting for 2 hours the kind assistant sourced a different type of campervan for us (Austravel also ordered the wrong type of camper for us!!) and told us we had to pay aud$5000 for a deposit.  We were not aware of this!!  We got back our deposit but lost money due to the exchange rate!!  We got reimbursed for some things in the form of a cheque posted to me with a slip of paper saying ""cheque attached"".  No apology or regrets.  I have never heard from them since.  They will be hearing from me though!!",1

3371,"This is the first time I booked my tickets via Makemytrip.com and it has become the worst experience of all the air travel I had made. I had booked tickets on the 24th March 2008, for my family to travel from Bangalore to Bhuvaneshwar for the 1st of May 2008 on DN 766 [AirDeccan flight].The flight schedule as per MakeMyTrip.com website was 1700 hrs.Today when we reached the airport we were shocked to know that this flight was rescheduled to 1030 hrs the same day and we were marked as  ""No show"" passengers by the Air Deccan crew. When we approached Air Deccan authorities they said that ""Makemytrip did not provide any contact information of the passenger and hence we were unable to inform the passenger in advance on the flight reschedule"". I tried contacting the customer care centre of MakeMyTrip.com and the person who responded to me was very confident of the booking and had zilch information on the flight reschedule. This is a vacation I had planned a month ago and all my family members and I are disappointed with this incident. This shows how MakeMytrip has a very bad information exchange with its flight partners. Unfortunately I am not the only person affected by this, I have my neighbor who was also travelling in the same flight as mine , stuck in the same situation. Historically speaking this has also happened before , see this link,https://mouthshut.com/review/MakeMyTrip.com-141627-1.htmland its makes me wonder if MakemyTrip has lost its capacity to learn from its mistake.

3372,"Here is my review of makemytrip.com I and my wife recently went to a 13 day holiday to Paris, Switzerland and Italy. We used Makemytrip as our tour manager. It was an individually customized tour package.Their job was to suggest and finalize our itinerary, book the tickets and hotels, do the visa processing and suggest and book the local tours. My experience with Makemytrip was HORRIBLE to say the least. Here is why After a few rounds of discussion, We agreed on tour itinerary and the total cost. Then they booked my flight tickets but did not know that no visa dates were available till the flight dates. They made me pay a heavy sum'in black' above the agreed cost of tour to get visa interview date before the flight date.The tour cost included the train reservations as per the agreement. However, they made me pay 10, 000 Rs. more for one reservation which was already a part of agreed tour itinerary and reservations. They demanded the sum 6 hours before my departure and witheld the ticket until I paid the sum. I had no chance to make any alternate booking and had to pay up.One of the local tours that they offered included a guided tour alongwith a to and fro journey. The actual voucher was good only for the journey and was not a guided tour.They haven't yet given me a receipt for the payment which I have made 21 days ago even after a consistent follow-up for the same.During my entire interaction, I had to follow-up with them repeatedly for various tasks to ensure that they are done before the delay could impact the tour itinerary and cost. They also did not respond to ANY of my emails. By the end, I had no trust left in them, was terribly pained by their loose operations and unprofessional conduct. A very strong recommendation to avoid them at any cost. I have also used other tour operators in the past. They are much more transparent, professional, operationally perfect, customer service oriented tour operators. I registered on mouthshut specifically to write this review on makemytrip.",1
3373,"I have booked 7 tickets(5 adult+ 2 children) for my family from Chennai to Delhi and return throught makemytrip.com(FLT 1574259 & FLT 1574444 respectively) on 8th April 2008 Because of the change in our schedule I had to postpone our onward journey and cancel the return journey & rebook it.  When I called MMT's toll free number(on 11th april), the executive who spoke to me suggested I call call up the airline and do the same as it would avoid MMT's service charge of Rs. 250/ticket apart from the airline charges.  Also she gave me the PNR nos. of the tickets with which I can cancel the tickets. As per the advice I had called up Indigo & Go air to reschedule/cancel the tickets on 12th april.  When I asked the go air executive about the refund of the money she advised me to get in touch with MMT and inform the cancellation to get the refund to my credit card. On the same day(12th) I called up MMT and informed the cancellation and I was told that the refund will happen within 7 - 10 days.  But on 22nd when I checked with by credit card bank, they said the refund has not happened. So I called up MMT and asked the status of the transfer, they told me that I have not informed them after cancelling the tickets thru the airline and hence the request for refund was not initiated.  When I told them that I had done that, he took a'call trace' request. He said after going through the transcrpit of my call they will refund the money & also waive Rs.250/ ticket if the same was informed by their customer care executive. Again on 24th when I called they said they couldnt trace the call because of some techinical issues and the person who spoke said she can take a request for refund and the refund will happen only after 7-10 days.  I astonished to hear that after 12 days of the ticket cancellation. As I had to travel this week & I needed the credit back in my card, I insisted that I wanted to talk to her superior so that I can put across my point. finally after lot of insistence she gave the line to one Mr. Sumith( her boss) who assured me that everything will be sorted out. He said he will personally advice the accounts dept. to effect the refund on the same day so that it will be credited in 3-4 days. Also he assured that their reference no. of the transaction will be passed on to me. After several calls I am still to get the reference no. as well as my refund.  With my first experience being bad I strongly recommend not to use their services. Today when I called them back, the person informs me that it will take another few days to get the credit. He also said the refund was done from their side on 27th(Mr. Sujith promised on 24th) and it will take fews days to reflect in my credit card. However when asked for the transaction ID so that I can follow with the Bank, he said there was nobody in their accounts dept. today(?) and he cannot give the ID today.  I am sure they dont take any action unless you keep following up. I am not sure what is going to happen after few days if I call them they are going to come up with someother story for not refunding the money.",1

Just before 5 days my Uncle expired in Mumbai at 2:30 PM I have to reach on the same day, since I was in chennai so I did have no other option except flying, I have to book 5 tickets for my family from chennai to mumbai, having no idea went through the following. 1)I called up chennai airport and queried for tickets tickets were available only in KF at a cost of 6750 (after discount) / ticket, which was way expensive to my pocket. 2)Called my friend who was a consistent flyer he asked me to checkout with Travel guru website, but it was veryyyyyyy slow and ticket was available in indian airlines costed 4380 /ticket and was forcing me to register which took ever rather me having 2MBPS cable connection and mozilla browser 3)Parallely while I was waiting for this website I was checking my mail in rediff and saw an AD for makemytrip, being a consistent member of mouthshut I always remember this one was rated very low, i was bit reluctant to go to that web. 4)but since it was an emergency and having my financial commitments, i thought of giving it a try and logged into the site, to my surprise tickets were available in, airdeccan (2030 incl of taxes), go Air(2500 incl of taxes), spice jet (3500 incl of taxes) And followed by all expensive airlines, airdeccan was already filled I got ticket with go air and the bookings went on fine, i did not believe untill the flight took off that I got the ticket that cheap that too for the same day. And since I got a HDFC gold card I got a cash back of 5% on my total cost of 12650/5 tickets Overall I am completely satisfied with the website, fare and usability I am sure I will be a consistent flyer if I can get the rates this cheap, as my friends pay 2500 for chennai to Bangalore. To my eye this looks to be a good one and I definitely recommend this web to everyone. The sad part was my mom has never flied before and was unable to enjoy the experience since it was not for good one.For me inspite of my uncle's death killing me there was a small consolidation that I was able to save my purse to a good extent BR.

3381,"I had booked my tickets for my trip to Mumbai to Baghdogra(2 ways) from Makemytrip.com For some reason, I had to reschedule my return tickets. I was asked to re-book my Indian Airlines ticket(Baghdogra to Delhi) as according to information provided by customer support, Indian Airlines did not have reschedule option. And my Go Air ticket(New Delhi to Mumbai) was rescheduled after paying the sum of Rs. 5, 700. I had then booked another ticket from Baghdogra to New Delhi. Now, due to some delay in flight, my Indian Airlines flight got delayed and because of that I had to reschedule my GoAir flight again and over the phone I was told that I would get refund of around Rs. 1150. After coming back, when I contacted customer support guys, they told me, I had never rescheduled my GoAir ticket and asked me to email proof of rescheduled tickets so that they can investigate further. The same was sent to them on Feb 3, I got reply from Kanika Sharma from Customer Support department saying she would call me back to discuss the stuff. She had even called me somewhere in mid of Feb but after that she just disappeared. I did not try to contact her again as my work did not allow me to but I think customer support should be mature enough to keep track of the issues which are pending. Ok, let's forget this issue for sometime. There is one more issue. This one is regarding the Indian Airlines tickets(Baghdogra to Delhi) which I had to reschedule. After reaching Mumbai, I called up Customer Support and they told me I can cancel my old Indian Airlines ticket and will get refund too. I was kind of happy then and asked them to cancel those tickets. They happily did that too. I got SMS from them saying, I will get refund of Rs. 3975. But when I checked my credit card statement, I found that I had got refund of only Rs. 2524 which is around Rs. 1500 less than what was promised. Now this was the 2nd time when I had bad experience with customer support. Especially 2nd time was bad as I was promised that I would get refund of Rs. 3900 and got only Rs. 2400. I would strongly suggest everyone to think twice before booking anything from this website. For makemytrip guys(if they are reading this), my booking ID is: FLT571356 Cheers Deep UPDATE: I just got a call from Makemytrip customer support representative regarding this issue. The SMS mentioning the amount Rs. 3975 was sent due to some technical error, the actual amount was around Rs. 2200 which I have already got and Goair refund was of Rs. 160 not Rs. 1150. I was in impression that it was Rs. 1150 but it was not. In short, the issue is resolved. I have got the correct refunds. But I must suggest one thing, they should seriouly think about notifying the customer with correct information and by various ways(emil, sms etc.), specially in cases like this. If there was a technical error, the CS guys should have called up at the time of refunding the amount not when a customer writes a bad reviews on 3rd party site. Just my 2 cents though.",3
3382,"Makemytrip is a disgusting site. I really wonder why I even decided to go this site when I had the option of going to airlines' site and booking the ticket directly.   This was Friday and I had to go to Delhi on an urgent trip. My first instinct was to go to GoAir's website(I usually fly by GoAir). God knows what made me got to Makemytrip. The site was so damn slow. The search took forever to give the results and once that happened, booking the tickets was a task by itself. The transaction would just not take place.  I was 30 minutes into my visit and nothing was happening. I thought the site may have been slow. My net connection was fine. Not willing to give up, I called them up and was put on hold. Gosh, god knows what was happening. Another 10-12 minutes went by and finally when the operator came she irritated me by getting my name wrong. I had run out of fuel and decided to hang up.   Boss, Makemytrip sucks.",1
3383,"I saw a full page ad by Makemytrip in todays Times Of India giving the address of their new office in lucknow.I decided to go there and book a flight ticket.Before going there , I also checked on their website and found the address of their new office under flight booking. Now here the story starts.When I reached the office I was told that they don't have the software installed for flight booking so they can't book any flight tickets?? (Before issuing that ad the company should have at least bothered to check whether their office has the basic software to conduct any business or not). Better still, I was told by the guy there that I can book a ticket on their toll free number and pay the ticket amount into MAKEMYTRIP account at any ICICI bank.When I called up their toll free number and asked to book a ticket through this mode , I was curtly told by the guy that the only mode of booking is through credit card and there is no other mode of booking available? Wonder how this company functions when their employees aren't sure about what their company offers and what it doesn't.",1
3384,"I recently booked a return trip to makemytrip. When I went to the airport, I was informed that the going ticket had not been booked. I looked at the printout closely. The printout said that your ticket has been booked. On looking further, there was an interesting point - for the id next to the onward journey, the word FAILED had appeared. for the return journey, the normal id was present. hence, though the ticket for onward had failed, I had still got a ""Successful booking"" printout, possibly because the return had been booked. So anyone booking on makemytrip - please check if the word FAILED has appeared anywhere on the booking.This was the negative part. however, I was pleasantly surprised by the following: I called makemytrip from the airport - they informed me that the website had failed and asked me to book another flight immediately. I booked it on the same day. and they reimbursed the expenses later as well.very good response and customer service. tho there was a problem, they did try their best to rectify it.",4
3385,"Let me elaborate this pathetic customer experience I had with MMT Bangalore. After investigating on my own for a trip to Thailand, I on advice from one of my friend(who had a good experience) decided to book the trip through make my trip. I was quoted a price of 45 thousand for a trip to Thailand, the price was actually per person, but I thought its for couple and gave a go ahead. The tickets were blocked(Not booked) for my flight. Next morning I asked to stop booking the trip, as during night after carefully going through the details I realized the trip will cost 90 not 45-50 thousand. I also asked for the ticket cost which they reluctantly told is 50 for two people, a straight 12 thousand more than what I could have booked from Thai airways website directly ….No easy cheap tickets here baby J The hell broke loose on my stop booking demand, although the tickets were not booked still Makemytrip supervisor was asking for minimum 10, 000 penalty per person, so total penalty of 20, 000.They said refunding any portion of the 10, 000 advance is I have given is impossible. Its interesting to note that during whole conversation she was not elaborating on expenses on the Blocked travel ticket( Not booked) . I felt pathetic and restless was not able to concentrate on my work, I put my mere budget constrain into a high default. I finally checked with my lawyer friend, he asked me to go through the cancellation policy on website and file a consumer case. When I finally approached the supervisor in the evening with all details, She told we have mentioned in the mail that we will deduct 10, 000 non-refundable advance regardless of whether the tickets were booked or not. I mentioned there was no mail communication to me regarding this, Bang! She rushed and checked and found that they missed to include penalty clause. Now comes the sentimental part .after all that harassment she lost her ground and took a U turn and started saying that now she has to pay 20, 000 from her own salary as the company has a policy to not let any customer slip without paying penalty for their service, if the customer escapes then its employees turn. What a stupid place to work for. Finally based on loosing ground she told me that she will deduct at least 2 thousand as she forgot to include the penalty clause in the mail. Well while she checks for ways to cut that 2 thousand out of my pocket …I am just wondering why Indian companies don’t have consistent customer experience …Some happy others disgruntled and harassed.",2
3386,"We recently took a 6 Nights / 7 Days trip to Bangkok and Pattaya, Thailand.  We started from Bangalore on 24th Dec (late night) with high expectation that the trip would be a memorable one and nothing could stop us from enjoying the next 7 days.  We landed in Thailand on 25th December and later on travelled to Pattaya right away from Suvarnabhumi International Airport, Bangkok.  We booked it on Thai Airways and to be frank, the journey (3 Hrs 45 mins) with Thai Airways was smooth ( though not as smooth as silk :) ). Next they asked to check-in in ""New Day-Night Hotel"" in Pattaya.  If I could compare this with some hotel in Bangalore, it would be one of them in Majestic Area which would come for 400 or 500/- per night. :( We felt very bad about the hotel, room, the service etc etc ..  The only thing good about this hotel, is the location to near-by attractions.  Then, we consoled ourselves with saying ""Anyway 2 nights in Pattaya, and we can enjoy a lot in Bangkok"".  Then somehow got through with this hotel and landed to Royal Park View hotel in Bangkok.  This to our surprise was even more worse than the one in Pattaya.  Again the only plus point we had was the location and distance to MRT or Vegetarian hotel.  Apart from that, this one hotel, we saw one of the worst room service and mediocre breakfast etc .. etc ..  We totally belived MakemyTrip and spoiled our trip and that too by paying a hefty (yes, you heard it right a hefty price) of 32K per person. When we inquired about the prices there, we clearly understood that MakemyTrip has made atleast 10K profit per person on the Hotel Price alone. :( :(  This is the first time I have ventured into writing a review on something.  We really felt very bad about the promises made by MakemyTrip and what we got !  Please be aware that MakemyTrip is not the best Tour Organizer.  The best option would be to book air tickets seperately and then book hotels seperately online.  Or just book the hotel for the day you are arriving there and rest of the booking, you can get it done on the first day.  It works out very cheap and no gr8 intelligence is required to get that done.  Hope these points will help somebody in the future.  TO SUMMARIZE: BAD (or WORST) experience with HOTELS booked by MakemyTrip.",1
3387,"MY WORST TRAVEL BOOKING EXPERIENCE! Read on. I have used several travel sites before expedia, travelocity in US and received great service for air tickets and hotels. Now, I thought that e-commerce is catching up in India too when I came across makemytrip.com.but wait, I had surprises ahead. DAY 1 - I make 3 hotels bookings thru MMT in Varkala(1), Kovalam(2) and Kanyakumari(1) - a total of 4 nights(Dec 26-30, 2007). I get e-mails that my hotel booking are CONFIRMED.I book flights on Deccan and Jet Airways(directly). Was looking for a great vacation ahead.(I find that my credit card is charged.all set for vacation, eh?) DAY 3 - MMT agent calls up and says I have issues on my Kovalam hotel booking and I need to downgrade from Deluxe AC to a standard room, the other option cancel my boooking completely! I protest and he says that he is going to escalate to marketing manager. (Booking ID: HTL82223 ) DAY 4 - Another MMT agent calls, says my Kanyakumari hotel booking has issues. MMT agent says that the hotel has declined the reservation request. Gives me an option to book another similar hotel. When I saw reviews of this alternative hotel, it was poorly located and ill maintained. I protested that I this is not fair and the credibility of the CONFIRMED bookings! Agent said that he'll get back. (Booking ID: HTL82156 ) Still waiting for MMT for get back! Will post further updates. I am sceptic if I would ""actually"" get those confirmed bookings. Whats worse is that my other choice hotels are now booked and I have done non -refundable air tickets, leaves approved and other activity plans during the trip etc. I have about 12 days to go for my scheduled trip.and each day I'll keep wondering if my bookings will be actually honoured by the hotels.or be asked a premium last moment on alternate options?! who knows! I am not sure what kind of arrangements MMT has with hotels but this experience brings strong suspicion on the credibility of the sales done thru site. Lesson learnt.definitely will not purchase here in future and recommend the same to others. Keep off MMT. Dated - 13/12/2007  UPDATE: 24/12/2007: Booking ID: HTL82223  -  MMT has since re-confirmed my original booking. Booking ID: HTL82156 - MMT has given me a alternative that seems satisfactory, but I'll get to know the reality when I reach there. I am not changing this review or rating until I complete the trip I am off for the trip tomorrow.for now, and am keeping my fingers crossed. will post further updates when I return.",1
3388,"Dis-claim-her:All characters in this review are real. Resemblance to actual people is purely intentional & their actions is accurate, as seen from my side ;-) Curiosity traps the aam aadmi:the root cause of this review – a brief flashback on how I had my tryst with MMT ( MakeMyTrip). I am asked to book BLR-TRVM & return on 21st & 22nd November, respectively. An onward journey by Jet & return by Kingfisher suits me. Now I am left with going to these 2 sites & book individually. Suddenly from nowhere a temptation to check out services of MMT come in me. I yield, not having to visit 2 sites, enter card details twice, take 2 printouts etc. Soon I am registered & booked & got my E-ticket, printed & slept peacefully.  Kahani mein Twist:on Nov. 5, As if to make this review possible the universe conspired a twist in the itinerary with me having to stay 1 more day – to return on 23rd. Having booked thru MMT I had to change dates only thru them. What follows below is a blow-by-blow account of the events of the next 20days. 1)I call MMT line in Bangalore, who say all customer support is from Gurgaon only which means I have to make STD calls. They do have BSNLMTNL/Airtel toll free number which means others telecom users have to shell out a lot on STD charges, considering that issues don’t get solved in one call!  Lesson#1: wise not to use MMT, wiser not to use their helpline. 2)I call Gurgaon office & meet MMT support officer Sirish. I ask for a return date change. He quotes Rs. 1150. He says “sir, Rs 900 is what Kingfisher charges & 250 is MMT service charges” I start regretting MMT, thinking if I had done thru kingfisher, I save at least 250, for MMT was charging 250 for no service.  Lesson#2: why pay the middle man when the source is with you? same internet gives you airlines websites & there also u need to printout. It’s the same way as ‘god is free, but we have to pay the priest to access him” ;-) 3)for lack of many flights BLR-TRVM I go ahead wit date change. Sirish tells me, he will process the payment. How? I am to give my CC number, CVV, name, card validity details on phone!!! I enquire about the safety. He says its secure. That’s when I recalled the original payment I made on MMT was also insecure. One just enters all CC details into a web form. The site is not secure! Imagine a disgruntled MMT employee having your details & misusing it. Of course there is cyber police, IP address etc to track? But why invite a headache just because dispirin is available? ;-)  Lesson#3: unsecure payment methods 4)My 6th sense is restless thinking I have been charged excess. I seek opinion from others including my manager. Everyone thinks 1150 is a bit too high. Being a disciple of THE TRUTH & seeker of truth in day to day life, I set out to find the truth. I call Kingfisher helpline. I narrate the above & ask her if KF would charge so much. She gives me figure of 350Rs & declares I have been charged excess.  Lesson#4: listen to the gods(airlines) for the priests(middle men like MMT) have vested interests 5)I am in a dilemma. Do I go ahead & fight for refund or do I simply keep quiet. Since I can claim the expense from company I could keep quiet too. But I work for the ‘Ethics company’ that prides in its adherence to ethics. Though the amount looks small why let MMT indulge in daylight robbery? Wouldn’t that amount look better in my company’s balance sheet? Also I wonder on what basis did Sirish quote 900Rs for kingfisher? Don’t they have a standard price list for issues like date change etc, the way KF lady explained to me? I decide to fight. I began the battle on 2 fronts – landline & online – by way of calls & emails.  Lesson#5: when in dilemma, just fight. The war must go on ;-) 6)I call MMT & meet Deepti this time. I narrate 1 to 5 above. She readily agrees I have been charged excess, but doesn’t have an answer as to why Sirish would quote 900 on his own. She assures refund of Rs 550, the remaining 600 going 350 for KF, 250 for MMT service charges(?)  Lesson#6: there is no logging in of customer queries & resolutions. So every time you call be ready to narrate the whole ramayan! 7)After 2 days I check on my CC statement online to see refund. I am in for a surprise! Instead of refunding 550, I see 2 charges of 1150. I sent a mail to MMT, Namrata replies “our databases show you have been only charged once”. I call Citibank, they not only confirm double payments to MMT, but also provide me with transaction reference numbers which proved 2 payments to MMT. They also assured me that if I give a declaration that I haven’t incurred a certain expense, they will investigate & act against MMT.  Lesson#7: MMT is unethical & does robbery assuming most ppl will not pursue the issue. 8) confronted with solid Citibank evidence Prateek from MMT sheepishly agrees charging me twice & agrees to refund 1150+550=1700 with in the ‘next 48 hours’. I got busy with work & travel for the next 6 days, but MMTs 48 hours had not still passed. By this time everyone I spoke to/mailed to at MMT had apologized & the number of sorries now stood at 235!  Lesson#8: MMT trains its staff to lie & say sorry twice in every sentence. I told them sorries do not mean anything unless you an act of correction. I also added british looted everything from india & left 2 words ‘sorry & thank u’ which you ppl are overusing, to which the reply was ‘sorry sir… thank you for telling this. ;-) 9)I call again to convey that I am not resting until this issue is resolved. Before Nikhil can say sorry, I attack –“tumare sorries leke muje achaar nahin daalna”. I threaten them saying ‘ I have recorded all my conversation with MMT & I have all the mails. So I am ready to go not only consumer court but Supreme Court also. I am put on the ‘floor manager’ umang, who tries to blame the delay by throwing big words like ‘server’, ‘transaction’ etc. I tell them I am an engineer & know how it all works. He promises refund within 24 hours.  Lesson#9: no co-ordination between support & accounts function within MMT 10)Umang’s 24 hours was =72 hours & I see a refund in my card statement online- At last after 20 days, 150 minutes of scolding on phone, 12 emails.  Lesson#10: for to-fro flights no need of going to overnight mushrooming sites like MMT which you can do thru any operator website. Not sure if their other activities like hotel, package tours etc are organized crimes. But from this experience I feel like a bobby deol singing ‘eisa zaqm diya hain, jo na phir bharega har haseen chehre (travel portals) se ab yeh dil darega hum toh jaan dekar yun hee mar mitenge(will fight till end, even with a sooside bomb) sun lo yeh haseeno(beware MMT, among your customers there are jehadis like us) yeh humse ab na hoga conclusion:Avoid MMT as far as possible!",1
3389,"I had one of my worst experiences on a travel portals around the globe when I went to Make my Trip website and called their customer service no. Their website has the following issue: You search your airline and then select the one you want It asks you to log on or register if you are a new user As a new user, it just won't let you move to the next screen after you have entered your basic info Unless you are a registered user, the site doesn't let you book a ticket Thereafter, I called their helpline no. It took me about 30 minutes to get through once I finally got through, here'e the conversation: Operator(Op): Yes Me: Hello. Is this make my trip Op: Yes Me: I am calling to book a ticket Op: Yes Me: Can you take the booking for me Op: Yeah tell me Me: Give details about the date of travel, sector and no of passengers Op: We have a flight at 520 am Me: Have to take an evening flight Op: We have another flight at 6 in the morning Me: I said evening flight After that the flight is found and I ask to book the flight. The Op tells me the web fare plus 150 rs as phone booking charges and the conversation thereafter is: Me: I can do it on your website but the site has some issues so it won;t let me register Op: Refresh your screen and do it again Me: Have done it Op: Do it again Me: I have been trying since sat so is obviously of no avail Op: Then you have to book on the phone Me: Then I hope you want charge me 150 as charges here as you have an issue on your site Op: Silence.You will have to pay 150.as that's the way it would be I was shpocked to hear those words. Finally I was told that they will call me back, which I never got a call. This is a scam to have issues with website, charging extra on phone, have CSRs that have no phone etiquette and IT WAS A COMPLETE DISASTER!",1
3390,"My worst experiance with Make my trip happened on 14.11.2007 when my booking Lucknow to Delhi via indian airlines flight was scheduled to depart at 10.35 am .During that week the all flights flying from lucknow were full as it was a Diwali week. I had booked in make my trip on 12.11.2007 from lucknow to delhi via India AIrlines and connecting from delhi to bangalore in Spice jet . As the flight was iat 10.35am I reached the airport at 8.45 am and went to the Indian airlines check in counter I was the 12 person in the que as my turn came the guy in the couter asked for my  identity proof I showed by PAN card then after a while he says there is no tickets booked in my name I was surprised I showed him the booking reference as given by make my trip he after seeing that asked the pNR no. generated for the airline I said this is what was given my make my trip when I had booked .and it says status CONFIRMED .He said in front of  50-60 perople standing in que that MAKE MY TRIP IS fraud and they had to loose money because of that and as such he cannot issue tickets against this itenary and aksied me to get the same clarified from them .I was very tense as I had to be back nay how in bangalore and  Lucknow was new to me by that tiem all flights to delhi , jet lite and jet airways have already closed there counters and flight was full .I called the make my trip guys  the guys in the call centre picked the phone and started chekcing what had happneed and then asked me to check with INDIAN air lines if any seats left , there was no seats lft it was full .Then he said he will call me in 1/2hour  time .In the mean time what I see there were 4 more custoemer with similar problem of Make my trip .After waiting for 1/2 hour I called them once again to find out if they have done any alternative arrangement .On calling and asking for that same they said he is busy with booking my tickets and will call in 15 min anaging no call for 20 min I caled one again this tiem a lady pciked and when I asked and by that itme I was furious and was in no mood to keep the phone till such time they give me alternatiev arrangement .Then finally she booked in jet lite from Lucknow to Cal and then cal to bangalore .The trip which was supposed to happen at 10.35 am happned at 1.pm and fianlly I reach blr at 8.45 pm were as as per earlier plan it was supposed to be 4.45 pm . IN all this though I didnt incur the loss but the harassment whcih I had to face was at its peak .MAKE MY trip gave an explanation as to the error could have been tickets were not booked din the airlines comnay site .But when I said if that had not happened why did you said staus confirmed and that if it has not happened should they call and infome .No answers were given Thsi made it clear that they dont have a system for checking if the tickets booked by them are actully  booked  with the airlines .So if you are not lucky you will face this problem . So my friends please be sure with these guys as and when you book tickets with them please call them up and find out if the same is done with airlines and also ask them to provided with pNR for those airlines tickets . I called there Customer care head Ms Feeta Eral she gace me a 7% discount in the next travel ( domestic) whcih now days if I book with my Credit card I get more than that .She says she cannot offer more that this .The customer Service is worst with them . Hope you all take my experience and have a smooth travel as and when you book with them . regards",1
3391,"20-Nov-07 – I booked my tickets through Makemytrip.com online for a round trip to Delhi from Mumbai. Departure Flight details as entered by me were Passenger Name (1) Meghna Khot, (2) Heena Patel (Adults) Booking date 20/11/07 Flight no. SG-114, From BOM To DEL, Departure Date 21/11/2007, Arrival Date 21/11/2007, Departure Time 11.55 AM, Arrival Time 13.50 PM, No of stops – 0. To which I received the e-ticket very late and only on demand. Arrival Flight details as entered by me were Passenger Name (1) Meghna Khot, (2) Heena Patel (Adults) Booking date 20/11/07 Flight no. IC-602, From DEL To BOM, Departure Date 21/11/2007, Arrival Date 21/11/2007, Departure Time 20.00 hours, Arrival Time 21.55 hours, No of stops – 0. To which I received the e-ticket very late and only on demand. Since the payment of Rs. 26, 902 was already made by me using my ICICI Bank credit card and e-tickets were not received by me for a long time, I placed a call at their call centre in delhi for them to resend the air tickets to me on my personal id too. I was informed by their personnel that Indian Airlines server was down and I was in the wait list. He also said that there was another flight available at the same time for arrival and would cost me the same. I said ok and went ahead with the booking as I did not want to wait for the Indian Airlines waitlist. The booking details were then sent to me Nowhere in the call was I informed that the flight was halting at Jaipur for 30 minutes Since I again did not receive the revised e-ticket and itinerary, I place a call again and asked for the e-tickets. This time Angad sent me the e-ticket instantly on both my ids. He too did not inform that the arrival flight was halting at Jaipur. The e-tickets also don’t mention that there was going to be a halt at Jaipur on my return flight from Delhi to Mumbai On 21-Nov-07 The arrival flight was delayed by 2 hours 30 minutes. It left Delhi at 10.30 pm. I ultimately reached home t 2.30 am on 22/11/2007. I can understand that these low fare airlines are not responsible for any delay which is less than 3 hours. But I came to know of the halt at Jaipur only at the airport while the announcement was made. Imagine a customer being fooled to pay as much for a low cost airline as much he/she would have paid for a high cost airline that too with a halt at another city for 30 minutes. This is sure Fraud and should be brought to your notice. I tried making alternative arrangements but in vain I did try to call their call centre again and asked for the lady to transfer my call to the supervisor. I was aware that she would not have been able to give me any solution. My call was kept on hold for 20 minutes without transferring it to the supervisor as I wanted to inform the supervisor about the irresponsible behavior displayed by the staff. But I guess it is in their blood. I patiently waited for the flight and reached home at 2.30 am on 22/11/2007 and gulped down my anger with a pinch of salt. I am yet to receive a proper reply from them",1

Geeta, from Makemytrip.com also assured me that I'll receive it, but 14 days have passed by and I'm yet to receive any communication regarding that. Imagine if I was to book an urgent ticket through makemytrip.com and the booking details were given to me after 4-5 days!

I received 3-4 mails from them to mention my credit card details so that they can retrieve my booking details. I made a domestic booking through makemytrip.com and the money was immediately charged on my card. But I still can't see my booking details. When I tried to call their customer care, they said, the card has been declined! But I can see the money has been charged on my Amex card! They said they'll call me and I'm still waiting for their call! I'm attaching a copy of my mail sent to makemytrip.com.: Hi, I made a reservation through Makemytrip.com and the details are attached herewith. I’ve confirmed with Amex card that the money has been charged to my card. But, even after making the payment, when I received no itinerary details, I made several calls to makemytrip.com customer care and my bank since this morning to know what went wrong. It seems I’ve made the biggest mistake of my life by booking through your website! I wonder how services like this still exist! Please be informed that if this issue doesn’t resolve within 24 hours of receiving this mail, I’ll have no other option that to lodge a case against makemytrip.com for this third grade service and unnecessary harassment.

3394,"Our flight no 290485 where we had made a booking to be done for the day 17th Oct and 18th Oct form Bangalore - Chennai - Bangalore.   We have done our booking online but due to a system error my moner was been debited from my credit card and the booking was not confirmed to the respective airlines. This we came to know in Chennai Airport when we were help up in the airport. First thing we were in too embarrassed state because after paying the entire amount we were help up just because booking was not done by makemytrip properly. We were travelling by Kingfisher Airlines and they asked us to pay the entire sum once again.   It was not possible to pay the entie 40, 000+ as we dint got the tickets on the same rate what has been offered by makemytrip but still we arranged it from our sources. Thats was a trauma we went through make my trip and thanks to make my trip for mental harassment.   From the airport we called up Make my trip office to know about the refund and Mr Ankush Kumar has sent a confirmation mail that the refund will take 5 working days. But no response after 5 working days. After that we tried calling up make my trip couple of times and the same response we got whenever we call up make my trip. Again I lost my patience and called up make my trip and spoke to Ms nupur Singh and the same confirmation mail I received form her which I m forwarding to you.   But I know for this time also nothing will happen. So should I assume that make my trip earns money by doing such mistakes and not refunding the money back. Or they dont have capable operations team working. I dont know now what should I assume. It was just a bad experience I have faced and Thats for sure none of my friends including me will ever have any relationship from make my trip.   I just want to know the exact time period my money to be credited back to my credit card and the charges which I have been charged for the late payment and also the interest which I would have earned by keeping in my bank account. If I dont get this done within this 5 working days I have whole right to file a case against Makemytrip to Consumer Court. I seriously dont mind spending another a lakh if I have to rip you people off in from of Indian Public. Please Dont take this statement otherwise, you can very well imagine what trauma we have gone through because of inabaility of Make my Trip and what we would have faced in front of the public in Airport.     Please treat this mail as a very urgent and on priority basis.        Thanks and Regards    Shruti Lath",1
3395,"Too bad experience I had.Their technical difficulties fume every now and then.I was charged twice.Then I had to read stories to customer care everytime detailing the issue whenever I call beacuse its not that a single person will respond to u.And then noone will reply to ur mail other than their standard reply ""Thank you for We will keep track of things"" ""The consumer will keep writing and after some 4-5 mails may u'll get 3-4 words extra other than the standard reply.And then the payment they will do will be in bits and pieces.If ask for escalations or what is going on...u wont get anything.Ur credit card will charge u handsome amount and u'll loose the hard earned money.At the end after so much may b u'll get the money depending on how well u handle them.

3396,"Made a HYD-BLR booking today. Made the payment using my Bank of America card.The payment was accepted and even got a tracking ID from the credit card companybut after that nothing came up on the browser. Called up their custome care thrice and here was where the problems started: All the three of them sayinternational cards no accepted.Pointed out that in the payment option there is an option called ""Non Indian Cards"".Then they say its atest. So why are they testing using my card.They say call up the credit card company. Its an American card and its not easy to access the details from here in India. First of all if they are not accepting internation credit cards why not put the message clearly across. Each time I called up they said call back after an hour. The booking was for the next day. After one hour called up again. They say wait another hour to confirm. This is supposed to be an ""Ecommerce"" site, so what this thing of waiting for an hour and being in the travel business they do know that the prices dont stay the same. Finally as a resul bought the ticket on ""Yatra.com"" at almost double the price. Atleast on ""Yatra.com"" they put a note saying no international cards accepted. Still have no idea what happened to the charge on my bank of america card. Guess need to get back to the US to find out. I'm a sales manager in an US company and am not trying to malign or endorse any site. But if this is the way the conduct their business with their customer care having no idea of what going on they do deserve to be targeted for their shoddy inefficient service. Have put this even on our company intranet highlighting their shoddy inefficient service. Do hope they realize how inefficient and frustrating their service is to the customer. Do hope they take this in the right spirit and improve their services. A lot of people have heard of the site through their massive internet campaign but they sure not going to get many repeat customers with this way of doing business.",1
3397,"If you are thinking of buying tickets with Makemytrip, DO NOT BUT FROM THEM. Apart from the disappointing things you hear from others, they have cheated me of my refund when I cancelled my tickets to India because of health reasons. I agreed to pay the cancellation fees, and the customer service sent me a letter stating that they would refund me$1850 difference but it has been over a year since but they keep ignoring my requests. You will know the true colors of a business when you have an unusual situation - otherwise everything sounds good. If you need cheap tickets, there are plenty of other agents in your area that can help you out. Why go with these guys who are blatant cheats? Top of it all, they do not care about you since they feel there will be enough suckers around. I sincerely feel you will get a good deal all around if you find a local agent.",1

For the tickets cancelled in April-2010, they have not made me the refunds till date and there is no satisfactory reply. Calling them on their phone numbers is a frustrating and nerve wrecking experience, they keep on IVRS hold for hours and even then you dont get any proper replies. they hv employed dumb customer care agents who hardly know anything. I would advise all the readers of this review never to patronise MMT. I have blacklisted them forever now and I will never use makemytrip.com again. Cleartrip is lot better. Raghav",1

So I start LIVE CHAT and then they gave me one no to call on Ext 2009 (Deepti Emp. NO: MMT097) and when I talk to her she said though they gave me confirm sit it's not confirm by air-india so they told me that you have to pay more to make it conform from their side and extra money they ask was $135 . When I told them that even real agent is charging less money as total compare to what my total is going to be with Make my Trip and they told me that if I want I can cancel my ticket but now they can not change their price which they had in past ... and the thing is I went to their website today also and they have same fare which I had purchase my ticket for ... so I ask her that then why your website shows this price and still I am able to book new ticket from their and she said their website has some problem and they can not fix it !!! When I ask for my cancellation confirmation, she told me that your ticket was not confirm so they can not send any confirmation ... and I said it was conform and also I paid my part and she said ... it was not conform by website so she can not do anything....

3400,"My heart sank all the way down wen I came across the reviews for makemytrip.com after I had payed them an advance of 20k for my mauritius trip last month(aug'07). But luckily my experience with makemytrip.com was a fantastic one. Not only did I get all my documents posted to me on time, the call center person I corresponded with was a sensible and helpful one. After I reached mauritius, their local operators took good care of us and it turns out many other operators like cox&kings, sotc etc have got the same operator in mauritius as MMT'z. Infact, we were taken for the local sightseeing trips together. That means I got the same service as others but for much less. Well I should thank makemytrip.com for making my second honeymoon trip a great one. And for those who are disappointed by the reviews they get to read here, always remember'MOSTLY people with bad experiences will bother to put the effort in writing a review'.",4
3401,"I booked a ticket from Bangalore to Mumbai and the return journey through Makemytip for a sum of Rs 3908. But, I did not get any e-ticket mailed to my email id.All I got was a payment code and a flight id code.The money got debited from my credit card account within a day. So, I called them up and asked for the e-tickets.They said that I should have got by that time, and they will once again forward the same.So, I waited for another half -a day for it but I never received any mail.So, I again called them up and this time started demanding the exact details in a pretty harsh tone, I should say. Then, they came up with this new excuse saying that their server machines went berseck and that I will be receiving the mail within a few hours and Oh! yes, each time I call them, they ask all the details about the complete booking.Now impatient that I am getting, I wrote them a complaint through their website describing the complete problem and that if it is not corrected within a day, legal route would be my only resort. The next day(3rd day from my booking) at some 7 am in the morning, I get a call from some call centre girl saying that everything has been restored to order and I can expect the tickets in a few minutes.Again , I wait and wait and finally in the evening I call them again. This time, they wouldn't even lift the phone.After around 20 minutes of continuously ringing , they lift it and immediately cut it down.I kept on trying the phone for the next one hour, sorryfully bearing the stupid music that they put on.At last someone lifts the phone and doesnt even care to apologize for the delay.Anyhow, I was past way beyond niceties by that time. I told him the whole story and then this time he starts asking the name of the sales guy to which I gave the original complaint.These idiots don't even maintain a complaint number.And then he keeps me hold for another 20 minutes(yes 20 mins) and then comes back only to say that my booking id is not in their accounts.Now, things are going the wrong way. So, I threatened him with a legal option if I did  not get the ticket within a day and asked his name and all other details. Finally, I called them the next morning and they gave me the PNR numbers of the two different airline tickets, but never cared to still send the ticket.So, I took that number and called up Air Deccan and requested them to forward the ticket to my mail id which they did.The other Airline is still yet to send. Till now, I did not get any ticket from those idiots. One bunch of assholes.Never ever trust these guys with your travel plans or your money.Finally, the Makemytrip guys resolved my issue and had a nice trip to Mumbai and Back.",1

I found that they have put all the catches for changing the dates. mean while they have charged my account, and it is been more than 1 week, and they haven't issued the ticket for me.

First bad experience was with their courier dispatch policy which said they can not deliver me tickets becuase Blue Dart is not present in my city, 4 days after booking my tickets. After an illogical discussion with their call center people which is the slowest and most ignorant call center in the world, they did not send me tickets to my address , instead made me visit one center in Hyderabad to collect those. The last thing which is even more agonising is that they booked a wrong paper ticket for me, for a flight at 7.45 PM instead at 5.45 PM as mentioned. And the call center person is not even ready to acknowledge this. They are very stubborn and don't care for customer experience or convenience. This was my first and last interaction with MMT and I request all of you to be beware of the most illogical and irresponsible travel agency in this world.",1

On the said date while I reached the counter to check-in I was told by the spicejet crew that there are no tickets in my name! I tried desperately to explain to them that only one pnr is cancelled and that the other one must be active. But I finally realised that both the pnrs' had been cancelled by make my trip. On contacting the call center of make my trip I was told that there was a mistake from their end and I should issue a fresh ticket and send the boarding passes to them so that they can process the refund. I thought atleast these guys have realised their mistake and prompt in making amends. I was promised a refund within 10 working days. But then began my ordeal, inspite of repeated reminders to the call center my refund has never got processed. Each time they tell me that I would be given the refund within a week( which is an outright lie), and after a week they come up with the same lame duck excuse. It reflects a complete non-professional attitude on their part and advise all not to ever touch their website with a barge pole. they are bloody suckers with not integrity and lie blantantly to customers. After reading the other reviews on this website I feel iam not alone and it a genuine problem with their service level and attitude.",1
3405,"Today I made a booking on Indigo from Bangalore to Hyderabad on MakeMyTrip.com for 6th of August. The fare was Rs 2239/-. At the same time Indigo is selling ticket for the same flight on the same day at Rs 2224/-. Even though the fare difference is so low, I just wanted to check the “Double the fare difference” campaign of MakeMyTrip.com. When I called up the customer care and inform these details to my utter surprise the answer was the difference is towards the commission to the MakeMyTrip.com and they can hardly do anything about it. Then I asked him do they suggest me to book Indigo tickets on Indigo site itself because they are available cheap from next time on the answer was something like “Do what ever you want! Go ahead and book from where ever you are interested” Is this the kind of response a customer care guy should be giving? If at all MakeMyTrip.com is not interested in providing challenging fares, they can always shutdown the campaign. First thing MakerMyTrip.com should do is to train their CS executives Am attaching snap shots FYR  At last I am back to Hyderabd, MyTrip went fine. MakeMyTrip has refunded my ""Double the Difference in Fare"", Anyways at least after my Complaint they did react the way they should. I think that might be a one in thousand times it will go wrong, and I ended being the Guy with that fate. Keep booking and Njoy your trips, And keep checking this corner for more reviews.

3406,"I had booked 2 tickets for mumbai- hyderabad sector from make my trip on 10th July, travel date being 14th july by INDIAN Airlines for Rs. 3710. The booking ID is MMT- D796431. We received the itinery details, pnr no. for the booking made. On arriving at the airport the Indian Airlines counter executive informed us that the PNR No. submitted was of no use as Make my trip had issued us paper tickets and unless we submit the tickets thay caanot issue us with the boarding pass. In case we could not submit the tickets we would have to purchased fresh tickets from the counter. On contacting the call centre of the web site, we were informed by their executive that the tickets were courriered to us and that they were not responsible in any way even if we didnot reveice the tickets. Since I and my husband had to travel to Hyderabad for an important meeting failing which we would have suffered tremendous loss of bussiness, we had no alternative but to purchase fresh tickets from Indian Airlines by paying an amount Rs. 5550/-.Since the flight was running full we were issued fresh tickets on the basis of our previous tickets' PNR NO. (Our ticket has a mention of this). After receiving the boarding pass and clearing the security we received a call from Blue dart (coourrier company hadling all courriers of MAke my trip) asking for our address to deliver us a package from MAke my trip. On enquiry they informed us that they had received the consignment from Make my trip only on 12th July, consignment no being 116810221052 dt. 12th July. So because of wrong Pin code mentioned us they had called us on 14th July. Since the consignment was of no use to us we refused to accept it. When I called, mailed numerous times to makemytrip asking them for a refund of Rs. 5550/- paid, they replied finally on 27th July saying that since we had mentioned wrong address i.e. pin code they would refund us back only the tax paid as it is a non refundable ticket. The airlines rules are that the tax refund is made only when the passenger cancels the ticket, but in this case I didnot cancel the ticket but had to purchase the same tickets again by shelling out extra money. I just want to ask Make my trip Is thier  responsibilty only to the extent of passing on the tickets to the courrier company and not ensuring that the passenger has received the tickets or no? Even a small time courrier company calls up the consignee in case of wrong address and sends the courrier on time, but only because of a wrong pin code I was subjected to sheer torture by make my trip and blue dart. I would like to advice everyone to be very careful when opting for Make my trip to book their tickets. It is always better to opt for the website directly rather than go through such websites.",3

I had gone against traditional wisedom of my father and book honeymoon trip for my elder brother through these guys on thier KL, Genting, Pinang, Sinagpore Route. The marketing department was prompt and cordial. I had raised all the small points like issue of visa fees, airport charges, theme park and entertainment tickets, quality and grade of hotel and amy many other issues for which every overseas traveller fears. I was assured repeatedly that mmt handles of such trips and that they care for comfort of their passengers and that they have great network. Also they emphasised that this package is better then the Europe or any other package since its 100% guided tour. Another most important aspect was that I was keen on being a part of the group because it gives sense of security and comfort and also services of tou rguide and and all. They assured that no singles are allowed and its group of 22 people right now with all being family or couples from various parts of country. But these buggers are damn liers and their lies were exposes at Delhi airport when no one turned up to guide my bro and sis in law to the international airport. The marketting guy who had called 20 times in 3 days and claimed he will introduce them to other co travllers never turn up and in fact the biggest lie was that no group was travelling. The MMT guys had claimed a group of 22 people first and last day claimed they full 30 member group. but there was no group. Even the senior most person named Mr Alok claimed that there was a gropu of 16 but then it was never there . The BMT( MMT) guys did not give the hotel booking vouchers and the local tour vouchers air port transfer vouchers as per their pre booking assurance and commitments on last day of travell they told it will be given at airport by the local guy who would be coming there to receive them . Then the horror show began. No one turned up at Kualalampur Air Port to receive them. The localTour guide number was not responding for hours and it took 8-9 hours to reach the deisgnated hotel from KL Airport. mean while my brother could meet another victim of BMT guys, . They guy with his 2 kids and wife was shattered and contemplaing return in first day itself but I guess two victims could solace each other and they carried on.The Driver was not even aware of the passengers and the number of people he had to ferry to KL city. He simple dropped my bro at hotel door and drove away. Then hotel first refuses to confirm the bookings and then  askes for big sum as security deposit. First day is wasted already. The dinnerswasoffered at tacky restaurent where you would never go . The next day the local tour is conducted in great hurry and scant details . My brother was shown the Twin towers from miles away. The tour was conducted in very poor fashion, its really a shame that these guys are tarnishing the image of intenet commerce. Finally my brother could contact me and I took the senior guy to task HIs name is Alok he aslo turned out to be a bigger liar and put all the blame on the local tour operator and problems due my brother being first time traveller. He lied again by telling my brother missed the time table and the fact was that no turned up for 2 hours to fetch them from the hotel reception. The local tour operator redemed himself by sending a proper taxi .  Here also MR Alok lies and tells that they will be united with the group but it was lie through and through. On their way to genting there was no tour guide the driver was most uncaring and un responding and agian at the cable car junction at genting higland they were force to go by taxi . First money was demanded for the cable care tickets. Finally after lot of debate the driver gets the tickets but says that some has to stay back in taxi beacause he can not take responsiblity of luugage.How can a man leave his wife in taxi and go by cable care or vice versa . Then the fight for theme park tickets .  They were told to pay first and get the refund later and finally my brother had to pay for indoor theme part and the outdoor theme park tickets were provided with much debate and fight. Even at this point of time Mr Alok was bold enough to lie yet again and inform that no money being charged . cable car ticktes. . These BMT guys gave a diffrent itenery on booking, diffrent itenary before the travell and diffrent itenary to the locatllour operator. Where by every step my brother had to fight for every facility and every rght that he was to be offered voluntarily. The BMT people had promised every possible support for the extra optional local tours that could be availed but that was of no conequence . Its surpuising co-incidence that these gues always take the call and agree to respond in 30 minutes but they dont. There 24/7 service line is of no use . Damn it if one has to call back to Delhi every time for every small issues. The optional tour in pinang for langkaawi was horror again with the local tour operator charging more money and providing less then basic service . I mean why do these gues run an international travell company when they don have the resources. The experince in singapore was no better with no support from the local tour operator and money being demanded for every small things .  The standard style was that you pay now and money will be refunded later . My brother had to go to MMT office in singapore and fight for getting the promised local trips.By this time this MR ALok(a big shot of BMT) was now getting busy and avoiding calls . Today my brother had come back and narrated the story I was pained and sad if is was due to tour price being on lower side they can ask more money upfront rather then spoiling life time memories of the travellers. They should price their tours appropriately. I did not bargain a single penny with them and they just knew what they were unleasing on my brother.I am asking all my money back from these buggers and theifs . I know no amount of money can bring back the lost ocassion . Even today they want time to find out things from the local tour guys its a shame that every time some one else pics up the fones and you have to tell the entire story.What a shame and pity but then if no one has yet made them pay for their unfair, misleading, and bad practices we will take this task . I know its difficult but then I know if one person stand many other will follow and set these buggers right. Please do not trust them with well being of your loved ones and do not take their tours . Its like you will in landing no mans land  . You can contemplate the horror of being stuck at a local airport for some reason then just understand  what one can do if he is stuck in forighn country . Even today they are such thick skinned that they don wish to admit the mistakes and missmangement.  I know its a long fight but then I know if one person takes them to court they will redeem their ways .",1
3410,"Srinath unfortunately you are not the only one who’s been through an experience like the above mentioned one, my story is almost the same, i had booked a return ticket Bangalore-Delhi on 3rd July and so far I have not received the return ticket in correct format and also the billing details. All I received was an email from one of the Reps in the service dept.with the itenary pasted in it which does not gives a complete info on the travel.I called the helpline on 4th July and I was promised that it will be sent right away with all their apologies, its been 6 days and I am still waiting for the billing details and also the return ticket in the correct format, Looks like they are waiting for an auspicious moment to send it . This will be last time I visit Makemytrip for any kinda booking or flight info.",1
3411,"I decided to take a package tour with my family to Goa from Bangalore on 5th July on a short notice. I picked makemytrip for the tour since the package deal sounded a good bargain compared to direct booking of flight and hotel or other travel portals. I called up the customer service on 4th July and asked for the booking details for 4 days and 3 nights package via kingfisher and stay at Phoenix Resort in Candolim Goa starting 5th July. Since my booking was at a short notice the CS executive informed that rates quoted in the site and that which would be applicable to me would be different. I would be charged more than what was in the site.  I asked him if the to and fro tickets and the stay in hotel were confirmed. He confirrmed the same. So I was quoted a total amount of Rs 25600 /- for to and from from Bangalore to Goa by Kingfisher and then 4 days+ 3 nights stay at Phoenix Inn Resort in Candolim for a couple(spouse and I) and my infant. I went ahead and gave my credit card details and asked the CS executive to charge my card for this package. He did the same. I did the booking around 3 PM on 4th July, and since my trip was to start on 5th he promised me to send my e-ticketsfor airlines  and e-vouchers for hotel reservations by 8:00 PM on 4th july. Now my trouble starts .:( I called by 5 PM on 4th to ask if the bookings can be done faster and send me the details by 6 or 7 PM. He said he would do his best. But this did not happen and by 8:00 PM after repeated calls he sends me the e-tickets for Bangalore to Goa(onward only) by Kingfisher. There was no mention/info about hotel voucher or return tickets. So I called up again and enquired about the same and got info that I will get all the e-docs by 10 AM on 5th July(the day of my travel). On 5th July as until 10:30 AM there was no mail from makemytrip I called up the CS to check on the status. To my dismay since the CS executive who was dealing with my profile was not available I was bounced from 1 department to another(6 hops) until the person informed me that she would get back on the details of hotel reservation and e-ticket for return. Then until 11:30 AM there was no call back. So I called up this CS person's cell and enquired about my e-docs. He said he as started working on it and would send me all the details by 12:00 PM. Then when at 1200 hrs nothing turns up in my in-box I called him again(already panic has setin by now) and asked about my tickets. No he gives me a bummer that my return tickets on Kingfisher were not available and only possibility is AirDeccan that would cost around 800 more. Will this be OK? I told him since my travel was already planned and I cannot backtrack, since it would cost only 800 more and I definitely need to come back to Bangalore on 8th, kindy go ahead and book the same. So by around I PM I got the e-voucher for hotel reservation which I printed out on the way to Bangalore airport. Phew! Then I started by trip . On 6th July morning aroudn 10:00 AM I checked for my return tickets and luckily my in-box had the same. But dissappointingly there was no ticket for my infant. There were 2 tickets for Goa to Bangalore in AirDeccan and no infant ticket. I got furious but held on since my day would get spoiled if I called this guy again. Later in the evening on 6th July I called this CS executive again and asked why my infant tickets were not booked? He replied that they had missed it while booking my spouse's and my tickets and then they could not add it. Then when I asked him who will pay for that, he said it would not cost more that 500 Rs and I should do so at Goa airport. Then I also asked him if he has charged my card for the airdeccan tickets and he said yes they have charged Rs 600 and odd per person(remember this per person was not mentioned in my previous call:(). I got really wild and blasted this guy and told him how they have spoilt my vacation. He then gave his manager's number. He listened to me and said the cost of Airdeccan should be borne by me and infant ticket can be purchased at the airport. I asked him what is the logic of Airdeccan tickets costing more than Kindfisher airlines? I had taken the offer of 25600/- for the trip on the basis of premium towards Kingfisher experience. But notion of Airdeccan ticket costing more than Kingfisher can only be a joke. of bad taste as well! Then he said he would look into it and get back. At the airport during my return I had to shell out RS 1877/-(not 500 or 600 bugs as mentioned by CS executive)  and that too added to the cost of trip. Net net I spent 28825 /- as against quoted amount of 25600/- with addition of anxiety, helplessness and not the Kingfisher experience. Now the big question is will they pay back the excess money I have paid - Rs 3225 /-? Has anyone faced similar problems earlier? How to go about to get ny refund? As a summary what do u get from Makemytrip: 1) Their business process is sloppy to say the least. They charge your card first but nothing is guaranteed for you as per the package. 2) They always promise to call you back but never do so. Probably its their business policy. 3) They know the knack of getting you hooked and then extort more money. 4) They break trust at every stage.",1

3413,"Do not use them... you have many better options -- Yatra.com , travelguru.com, cleartrip.com of course the airtravel companies too. They are pompous. They are big time advertisers. They know how to market themselves.... But their system does not work, they know how to make money without even booking the tickets, they do not know how to serve customer. They cheated me when I booked a ticket using their website. For information you can read the following blog https://krdpravin.blogspot.com/ I am pasting it here for reference in case the site takes time to open... At the time of Diwali I booked my Air ticket through a site http://www.MakeMyTrip.com. What happened there and what they did is here, due to their mistake I am still suffering. The happening is as under in point by point. I booked a ticket using his credit card from the website http://www.MakeMyTrip.com on 26th Oct 2005 for a flight ticket for 9th Nov 2005 from Indore to Bangalore, I have a confirmation for the same generated by the site which clearly states the flight time and date as 9th Nov 2005. I learned that they have intentionally and knowingly did not offer me my ticket for 9th Nov 2005 and asked me for his credit card details on 4th Nov 2005 and until 5th Nov 2005 they did not charge me, telling me that they do not have my credit card details for generating ticket for 8th Nov 2005. They did not dispatch the ticket for 9th Nov 2005 and I was asked to buy a ticket for 8th Nov 2005 which I never booked. I was asked my credit card details over telephone (that anyway they can not dare to do) for a ticket for 8th Nov 2005 which I never booked. I was charged for the ticket of 8th Nov 2005 on 5th Nov 2005 at 5:00 PM, they intentionally deceived me by, at first place telling me that they do not have my credit card details, secondly not provising me a booked ticket for 9th Nov 2005 instead for 8th Nov 2005 and on internet purchase, credit card is charged at the time of confirming the purchase. Why it took so much of time and fuss (making many calls disturbing me and I was asked to call to various people at their office) on MakeMyTrip end to generate any ticket that too say a wrong ticket. I was informed on 7th Nov 1:30 PM that they have booked a ticket for 8th Nov (as per the rules of MakeMyTrip no one can book a ticket for which flight time is less then 3 days and the need 3 days to send the ticket). There were only 17 Hours for the flight to take off and they were not in a position to send the ticket to me. Why I was informed on 7th instead of dispatching the booked ticket on 5ht Nov itself. I was informed that they have cancelled the ticket as I am not interested to buy that, Alas! a ticket our client never booked. Accordingly, they were advised time and again to reverse all the charges or they will solely be responsible for the damages. Here I do not intend to disrupt their business, but to protect my rights I am planning take this issue to consumer court, hope I shall get support from all those who have been cheated due ti their inefficient services. My problems are:- At first place why I was not given a ticket for 9th Nov 2005 which I booked and have the confirmation of the same. secondly, why I was charged for a ticket for 8th Nov 2005 (which I did not book) and I was charged for it on 5th Nov 2005 whereas I booked ticket on 26th Oct 2005 and they themselves breached their rules (not booking ticket for any flight departing 72 hours from booking time). I was deeply troubled for the mistake at the end of MakeMyTrip and had to change his very important business meetings and I have lost so much due to their mistake. So, I need compensation for the same and I always informed that to them in his various communication that they will be responsible for the expenses incurred at my end. The problem caused Spoiled my Holidays. Charged me unnecessarily. I had to book much costlier tickets. I had to change scheduled meeting and lost so much and specifically my clients due to that. My business was affected adversely. Expenses incurred at my end hiring a lawyer for taking care of the issue. So, I want the damages to be paid that are incurred due to their mistake. So, I want to inform you all, who are reading it and probably will talk to friends, that at the time of using https://MakeMyTrip.com beware. In my opinion you should avoid using the site.",1
3414,This is indeed one of the worst travel service providers or whatsoever you call them with one of the most un cooperative and unresponsive customer services! I was interested in booking a trip to kerala for me and my family on a immidiate basis as the plan was made up out of the blues and we wanted to go very badly the very weekend. I had heard good reviews about make mytrip from my cousin and hence decided to try out the same. Its an absolute waste of time to even try to contact these people.their response is so poor that you might even feel like saying a go to hell to the whole idea of travelling somewhere. First of all their website has travel packages whose date has passed by long back like march 2007.They are no more valid and when you call up expressing interest in those.the rates are different.Not a problem but why put those expired packages on the website in the first place! I must have called these people at least 5-6 times before making calls for this particular trip.The very observation to date has been that their customer support staff are very curt and upto the point.They do not divulge any extra info about the place or the services or the options.SAfter a certain point of time one doesnt even feel like asking questions coz the answers are just not satisfactory!It takes a lot of good effort to get someone to book a tour package for the family opr self and these poeple just dont have the skills required to talk to a customer let alone lure them.We dont care a heck if you book or not kind of an attitude just doesnt go well these days! Coming back to the experience of trying to contact these people to book the tour.it was  nightmare! I made a call in the beginning where I spoke to a executive who told me the revised rates.I told her that I would make up my mind.She asked me when she coulsd call me I gave her the tentative time .she never called! When I made up my minf of booking the trip.the executive who attnded the call told me details about the package.I had few more queries for which she said she would call me back.she took mu number and never called me again. I waited for half an hour and called up.another person attended and again took the details of the number of people abnd place etc.said that the network is down and would call back but he never called! I made 2-3 calls again as I badly wanted to decide on something.this time for 2-3 times my call was put on hold for 10 min after which I hung up. I never called them up again and neither received any call from them This was the first and last experience.I have made up my mind not to approach these people ever again and suggest that the readers also dont waste your time if these people dont respond in the first instance properly.,1
3415,"Well, makemytrip.com really look's like a joke among all these online travel portals. Following are some disadvantages which u will find out while booking your itinerary on makemytrip.com: I don’t know what kind of technology these guys are using but page take's age's to load. Look n feel of this Internet booking engine didn’t seems user friendly. Customer care center is not trained. They must appoint some IATA qualified guys. Very much confused that, I don’t know what kind of Global distributed system(GDS) these guys are using that never retrieves low cost, most of the time I realize that fare offered by makemytrip is much higher then another portals. And last one, its may be a personal reason, that I don’t know why. I never feel safe while I proceed through their payment gateways after selecting my itinerary. Well now competition is growing up in IBE industry, so better these guys improve their services. Regards MJ",1

3417,"I have booked tickets to India(Hyderabad) before and it was a positive experience. No hassles whatsoever. Remembering that, I booked tickets this year through them and this time unfortunately, the experience did not turn out to be so good. I had an unpaid balance on my credit cards so I was careful to tell the agent to split the charge on two cards. While MMT did do that correctly, I also noticed that the airlines(Lufthansa) had charged me again for theentireamount again. This pushed my credit card over the limit for the first time ever. Luckily for me, the credit card company was understanding and they waived the overlimit charge. Makemytrip also refunded the ticket cost from their end after a few days, but I felt it was all an unnecessary hassle for buying a single ticket. Something any ticketing agent should be able to do. On top of all this, the agent asked me for feedback. I don't want to leave him negative feedback lest it affects his job, but I don't think I can leave him positive feedback with a clear conscience. I also canceled this ticket a couple of weeks later, but after reading all these reviews, I am beginning to get concerned if I will receive a refund. My credit card company says I have to file a dispute within 90 days, but 90 days may not be sufficient for these folks to issue a refund. I don't understand how MMT can charge a credit card TWICE in less than 24 hours, but issuing a refund supposedly takes them several months. Anyway, I am going to let the credit card company take a loss so it's very probable I will put the charge on a dispute. Better that than find out six months down the line that there's no other option. If you have a straight forward, well planned trip and no changes(refunds, cancellations, schedule changes), MMT may be a good choice. However, the ticket prices are not definitely the lowest. I had to remind the agent to find me a ticket that was advertised on the web site. Otherwise, he did not bring it up during the conversation at all. The same thing happened last time as well, I think there are much better deals out there.",2

3420,"Wish I had read all the reviews here before booking my tickets on makemytrip.com. I booked 3 tickets to India from SFO in June and cancelled them in Oct (trip was planned for Dec 2006). I am yet to receive my refunds - it is 6 months now, that I have been trying to get my refund.. The customer service reps have been promising me that this would be processed in a few weeks (sometimes they outrightly lie and say you will get it in 1 week! sometime the ETA is 15 days) Their customer service is a joke, even after complaining to better business bureau, nothing was offered to me in terms of compensation. I just want my money back and am sick and tired of their service agents not giving me any information on their process. I had sent all my paper work (cancellation request, credit card info, ID etc all in time), so why am I being penalized! If only people in their organization had some sense of ethics and civic duty.

3421,"I booked tickets for my parents on makemytrip.com after a friend suggested it to me. I am sorry to say that I had a horrible experience and I would never ever suggest it to anyone else. 1)For booking the ticket, the agent on the toll free number asked me the names of the passengers as listed on the passport. I was not sure if the passport had listed their middle names, so I just gave her the first and last names and I told her that I would call her right back after confirming about the middle names (This was since she told me herself that the names on the passport should match exactly with the names on the ticket). By the time I got in touch with my parents and got back to her (which was exactly in less than half an hour) , she told me she had already done the booking without the middle names. And the passports did have middle names listed on them. When I asked her if it would pose a problem , she said no.. This was the very same lady who had earlier told me that the names have to match exactly. 2)After the tickets were booked, they dispatched the paper tickets to my parents in India. To our complete shock, one ticket had 4 out of 6 Pages missing and the other had just one page in it !! When it was shown to Lufthansa Airport office (The tickets were of Lufthansa), they said that we wouldn't be given the boarding pass with so many pages missing and that we had to get it rectified from the agents. On calling their toll free number, I talked to an agent who kept telling me that it is not possible that such a mistake would have been made by them . She said that she would get in touch with my parents personally and take care of the matter. She then asked me if they had received 2 copies each of the tickets. When I replied that they had only one copy each that too with half the pages missing, she wouldn't take my word for it and kept saying that it was not possible and there was some mistake..To make things worse, they have to travel within a week and everything has to be done within that time. We then got in touch with a person in their Delhi office who said that they would need to see the tickets (which they had sent to us )to see which pages were missing. We scanned them and mailed them as soon as we could. After that we made persistent calls to that person to inform him that we had mailed him the tickets but we were not able to reach him as he was ""busy"".We are still waiting for the new tickets / duplicates to be sent. !!!! Lufthansa office says it would have been much cheaper and easier had we booked directly through them ..For all those thinking of booking through makemytrip.com, forget it !!! It's just not worth it..",1
3422,"I had one of the most horrendous experiences with Makemytrip.com. These guys are very quick in getting  you the tickets, but when it comes to cancellation or refund. You can as well forget your money. In Jan, I  was supposed to take a connecting flight to Delhi and then take an international flight thereafter. But Due to fogs, my flight got cancelled. Since then, I have wasted my time and energy in following up these guys to get the amount refunded as the flight was cancelled and all other passengers were returned full amount. Not only did they not reply, they put me on hold for around half an hour each time I had called them from abroad. Finally they  said that they will be giving me the money if had sent them a fax. Which I did immediately. they again slept on it. Then I had to tell them that I am going to dispute the money and they said, another 5 days...Now almost 20 days has passed on it. I am trying to get my voice heard to the CEO, Deep Kalra. Please someone , get me his email id. My ticket reference is MMT-D402731, if someone wants to confirm.",1
3423,"Make My Trip can take you for a ride! it sucks! I agree with most of the posts here. The problem with these websites is that the money you pay to the airline is actually remitted through their accounts. In essence u pay to MMT and by some understanding it gets paid to airline later. The problem starts if a flight gets cancelled or you want to cancel it. In fact for Indian Airlines even e-ticket is not allowed..that term is given somewhere down the line in between the terms. So that means if u have not got the tickets delivered, you cant travel. Then keep calling them at the call centres which, as usual will have long queues or will be clueless!and forget your refund! Try emails u will not get any response.  As per an airline log...the system shows the booking was done there is a PNR num but no payment has been made to airline, , and the staff have no clue how it works. They wud abviously go by their systems and ask you to get the TICKET not a printed one but a real ticket!!",1

But I went ahead and booked it anyway to see what would happen. I have saved every page I came across and the Flight Details section indicates my booking is confirmed. However, when I click View, there is no ticket information, just the listing of the flights. I will be hounding MMT and Jet Airways to make sure this booking happens.

3425,"I have been booking tickets with Makemytrip (MMT) for a while now. I would easily have booked around 10-15 times (domestic tickets) with them and received good service from them. I had also cancelled a couple of domestic tickets (which were paper tickets) with them and I received the refund within 10 days as promised. Having had no trouble with them, I thought of buying an international ticket with them since my travel agent was out of town. The booking went ok and I received my AirIndia paper tickets on time. Unfortunately my travel plan had to be cancelled and I had to get my tickets cancelled. This is where my trouble started. I called them up and got my tickets cancelled promptly. The lady on the phone told me that the cancellation fee charged will be Rs. 4500 and my refund should reach me within 30 days. I waited patiently for 30 days to see my refund. After around 35 days I called them up and enquired about the refund. I was asked to wait for another 5 days with an apology. Days passed by and my frequency of calling their call centre increased just to hear each time that the refund hadnt come from the airline and it was expected within the next 4-5 days. After having called them around 8-10 times I got pissed off and decided to use my contacts in Airindia to get my refunds processed. They asked me for the BBRF number (some tracking number issued by the airline upon ticket cancellation) to find the exact status of the refund. So I called MMT back and I was shocked to hear that they cannot share the BBRF number with me since they use it for internal tracking. When I got pissed off and refused to do any further bookings with them, they noted down my cell number and assured me that someone from higher management would call up and get this issue resolved within the next 2 days. As usual noone bothered calling and I decided to take them to court. I met a lawyer who asked me to speak to them one final time before issuing a legal notice. As advised I called them up for the last time and threatened to go to court if I did not see my refunds in the next 5 days. What I saw after 5 days was a suprise. The refunds were sitting there in my account on the 5th day from the last call (and around 3 months from the first one). I also noticed that they had waived off service charges applied by MMT and the fee charged was Rs. 4000 only instead of Rs. 4500. To Sum Up - Prompt delivery of tickets. Refunds are prompt for domestic tickets (though I have cancelled only twice) Very big problem with refunds when the amount is large (eg. international tickets).",2
3426,"I finally got the lufthansa refund but it was really a struggle. I actually contacted a lawyer(I have some in my family and friends' circle in India as well as in the US) and gave them(makemytrip) a clear deadline by myself. I spoke to Mr. Rupesh Srivastava and I also wrote to Ms. Geeta Eral(geeta.eral@makemytrip.com) and they both seemed to have taken the action finally. By the way, I also tried to send an email to Mr. Deep Kalra,  although I never heard back from him. I was about to contact some newspapers but they gave me the refund by then. They also sent me a$125 check as a compensation. My suggestion would be: Don't waste your time talking to just anyone over there. Most of them had no clue. Try to correspond at the managerial level and that's set. Be ready to contact a lawyer like I did, if needed. I am located in Detroit area and I could only talk to them(someone like an authority) after 2 AM  my time. So I spent lots of sleepless nights on this. But at least I am relieved that they finally gave it to me.",1
3427,"These guys are shoddy. I had booked some domestic within-india flights and my credit card was charged twice - even though their website page said ""sorry, your transaction did not go through"". They never cared to inform me and I got to know about this only when I saw my credit card statement. After my reserviation did not go though, I did a reservation with the airline website. So my credit card had three charges for the same trip. When I called their customer service to get this rectified, they cancelled all the 3 bookings. This is despite me telling the rep a dozen times not to cancel my trip but only take care of my triple booking. My flight was at 1.30pm and fortunately I found out about the cancellation that day morning when I called the airline to confirm. I was on the phone for like 2 hours in the morning from like 7am to 10am with makemytrip trying to get rebooked on the flight. They really made me miserable. I will never ever go back to them. Its better to do the bookings from the airline website since the prices are the same and the airline websites are a whole lot better than makemytrip. One big disadvantage with makemytrip is that they don't accept international credit cards(card issued outside india). Pretty ridiculous in this day and age. Addendum: When I spoke to the rep about the triple booking, she said she would like to know my PNR for the booking I had done through the airline. She emphasized that this was only for verification and that she will not cancel it. But lo and behold, the next day morning my worst fears came true. Its amazing but makemytrip actually called the airline and cancelled my ticket. Upon calling the airline, they maintained that the guy calling from makemytrip had my PNR and other details and they had no reason not to cancel it. I was outraged by this invasion of privacy. In the US, a third party cancellation of this sort would not have happened. Fortunately the airline told me the name of the MMT rep who called in to cancel my ticket. This helped me convince the MMT reps that a cancellation had indeed occured and it was an MMT guy who cancelled it. If not, they would have denied they they ever cancelled it. This was a high stakes situation for me since I had an international flight the next day. Caused a lot of tension for me and my family. Not once did the MMT people feel apologetic about what they had done. I had to continually prove my position again and again.with the numerous reps.",1
3428,"Well, like others I was lured by Makemytrip's(MMT) AD and did lots of online air ticket bookings with them.  But be careful my friends, on how they calculate the fares. I recently found a bug in their fare calculating method(may be they should give me some prize for bringing out the bug in the system and fire their Project Manager - haha). Ok this was the scenario. I wanted to book one adult, one child and one infant ticket from delhi to bangalore - 16th march via Indigo Air. The fare was 2399 and when it calculated it showed: 1 Adult     2399 1 Child      2399 1 Infant      2399 Airport tax  3675 Serv Tax          0 Total          10872 I was suprised that they were charging full fare for infant, when its 10%. I went to https://goindigo.in site and they did the calculation as: 1 Adult     2399 1 Child      2399 1 Infant      275 Airport tax  2, 675 Total          7748 That’s about Rs. 3, 124 extra! Wow, is that low cost airlines booking site or they have these tactics to earn more? Or is it a software bug. Are our websites so buggy? MMT can u please explain? Or if that’s how you charge, why would we use your site and not use the real airlines website? Lemme attach screenshot so that there is no doubt:D Be careful friends! Cheers",1
3429,".**Experiences are what make us retain the incidents of the past. I happened to go to Indore few months ago, and the best suited flight was suggested to me by'Makemytrip.com'.

3430,"I have used the site many times and currentely using frquentely . Good experience in the sence - I have booked a flight from Delhi to Kolkata  from the site for IC  in business class. Got a call in next day from CC that there is no seat availible in the IC so please take jet flight in same money. My another companion was travelling in same IC flight so I denied .Then they upgrade my ticket to executive class . Really this was a good experience with them. Once, I booked 2 tickets  through delhi to mumbai and return in Spicejet and JET   I got the e-tickets for Jet but not for Spicejet. Once I got CAB services from Airport to Home! I tried to talk to CC, call  aprox 3 hrs then could talk and my from resolved. so they should extend their services in CC.

3431,Me and my wife are in Canada and we recently planned a trip to India and then to visit south east asia.We saw an add for makemytrip for the same and were interested in the package.I can promise you this was the worst experience that we have ever had in almost 5 years of travelling around the world.I sent my passport to them for stamping on the day we arrived in India and they had 15 days to get the same done. We were supposed to visit Malaysia and Singapore and had paid visa charges in advance. I only recieved my passport with only the singapore visa stamped on the 15th day only a few hours before the departure. We had paid in advance and the treatment given to us during the time was absolutely horrible and totally unexpected. Each time we called our call was atleast transferred 5 time and we were only given very vague answers.We made the trip only to find out that this was the exact same treatment given to everyone in the tour and one family was even forced to miss out on the tour and they could only join at a later stage. We were given a tour which was actually designed for a delhi group and we were going from mumbai on different flights. We missed a lot of activities because of this and the local guides were always more than willing to blame everything on make my trip.I would advise you that please dont get decieved by their ads as it is amongst the worst run travel companies you can ever find. I think I have seen tour operators that take you from mumbai to mahabaleshwar who are more ethical and offer a better service than them.If you still wish to go on I wish you all the best. I dont think its possible that around 40 people in a tour group had no kind words to say about them and only their personal nightmares to talk about.,1
3432,"I live in California and for my vacation to India, for a trip from Hyderabad to Chennai (roundtrip), I made a booking  with india.makemytrip.com. Though the website interface gives an  impression of being good, it never accepted my US credit card. After 2  failed tries, I went into the site's online chat and in about 30 mins  time, they made my booking. There were no issues with the ticket and I got my seat. The issue was with the booking itself. MakeMyTrip India charged me 4  times for the same trip and also charged 4 or 5 foreign transactions  fees. When I tried to contact the online chat, as soon as they knew that I'm coming for ""customer service"" and not for another purchase,  they disconnected the chat. Also, when I wrote an email to service@makemytrip.com, they never . Then I called the MakeMyTrip US office at NY and they took  all the details and said that they will pass on the information to their Indian office and someone would call, but noone ever called me  back. The US office could not resolve my issue either. Then I called my credit card company and filed a dispute. They were  able to recover only one of my charges for $123, and another for $92  but makeMyTrip did not refund the remaining amount . Till date, makeMyTrip still owes me $133.97  for the amount that they overcharged me, but I have not recieved my  money back. Maybe my next step will have to be legal action against the company, I don't see any other way to recover my money.",1
3433,"I had such a bad experience with them. I had booked a Bangalore Delhi flight on 27th Dec, 06 on sahara flight. I was charged instantly on my credit card.

I have given up hopes of getting my money back from them.. Such a pain My advice to all gullible people out there, pls. beware about these moroons. They don't provide any service & charge you for no service at all. May their tribe banish...Can anyone forward me a consumer court no. in bangalore or someone who would have gone thru the same hellish experience... God bless you all",1
3434,Had I seen this site before I made the booking I would never ever had booked my tickets. even after such reviews I am surprised that they have done nothing about their service.I had booked a ticket on the website - I agree that it takes so long and the system almost hangs after some time. I never received an e-ticket which was supposed to come on email. anyway the worst experience was cancelling the ticket. I had to wait for 30 mins everytime I called and I called almost 10 times. Realising that I wasnt making much progress I sent them emails for which I received no replies. what was absolutely crazy was that they informed that it would take 10 working days for the amount to be credited back into my account. when it comes to charging the credit card for the tickt how come their systems are such that the credit card gets charged immediately whereas when a refund is involved it takes 10 working days!!! makemy trip is just sitting and using the money - in other words plain stealing and cheating us. Its such a disgrace that after all that they actually have the gall to have their own people post positive comments on this website. any sensible guy who looks at the review could say that its nothing but the work of the marketing department of makemytrip. why does the website take everyone as fools? their fares are not the cheapest and their service is apalling. please dont use makemytrip.,1
3435,"They did not confirm our tickets until one hour before the flight. One of the 5 tickets was not confirmed at all. We had to pay Rs 8, 000 on the spot to buy a ticket directly. We kept calling them, stayed on hold for 30 mins to 1 hour, then told our case to whoever picked up, they hung up after hearing us out. Dozens of passengers on the airport were abusing them and talking about the same experience! That was the story in a nutshell, here's the full version - We had booked five air tickets with these guys to fly from Mumbai to Goa. The only reason I booked with them was because they had a cheap price on the tickets. However, after I booked I did not get the flight confirmation details and PNR number for days. I kept calling them everyday to obtain the details. The minimum hold time on their customer service line is 30 mins and most of the times you'll end up spending 1 HOUR on hold. If you press 1 for new bookings you immediately get connected to someone, but if you press 2 for existing bookings - you are doomed. And if you get smart and press 1 even when you have an existing booking, the representative will hear you out and put you on hold or simply hang up abruptly. When you email their general email addresses, they DON'T RESPOND. After you speak to a representative and take their direct email address, they might respond within a week only if your query is something obvious. Any complicated question or an inquiry of your ticket delivery will go unanswered or will be responded with something that doesn't help you. We finally got our PNR details exactly 1 HOUR before the flight departure. But, we DID NOT get the details for one passenger. MakeMyTrip told us to check with the airline. At the airport, there was NO BOOKING for that passenger. We had to literally purchase the ticket 5 mins before the flight, and is costed us Rs 8, 000 for a one-way fare. At the airport, I had two mobile phones with me, both on hold while calling their numbers. An operator picked up, I told her that my flight is going to depart in 15 mins and I need my PNR details. She hung up. There were DOZENS of passengers on the airport simply abusing this cheat company. I was sure I wasn't the only one, and it is certain they do this all the time. I'm trying to get this Rs 8, 000 back from them since 2 weeks now and its ridiculous to know that they are trying to bargain the refund amount with me. I don't think they care about how much I had to pay because of them. All they care about is giving me the least possible amount and shutting me up! Conclusions: 1) Don't book with them, they will cheat you in one way or the other. 2) The price on their site might be attractive, but don't fall for it. 3) The time you will spend on hold will be ridiculous. The cheaper price they offer is not worth it. 4) You will go through a lot of trauma and tension every minute after you book with them. 5) They simply don't care about you. 6) You always pay them in advance, so once you click that purchase button, you're doomed. 7) You are better off paying a little more and booking through your agent or airline directly. 8) Don't ever click that purchase button on their website.",1
3436,"Our worst nightmare came true when we went to board a Kingfisher flight with my Makemytrip e-ticket.We came to know that our tickets have been cancelld jus 2 hrs before the departure  by some unknown person.We got the ticket status as confirmed by the Kingfisher authorities jus 6 hrs before the journey and when we go to check-in, we were told by the Kingfisher authorities that the tickets have been cancelled. The sad part is we dint get the refund either. All we were told was that the ticket has been cancelled from Hyderabad which ironically was our destination.The flight was from Chennai to Hyderabad on NewYear Day.Even if we were to cancel the ticket, there is no way we cud have done it from Hyderabad where we were in chennai. In the end, we had to make new reservations for the same flight by paying double the amount already paid. I feel this is an prganised fraud happening through makemytrip.com.As there are no makemytrip official physically available at the airport, we cud not reason out our case to anyone. All we could do was call the makemytrip customer care which is good for nothing. It was a harrowing experience to go through. One hour of pure mental agony!

3437,"Nicolas Feuillate Brut Champagne Its the time of the year when you are on the move, hmm.. meant for holidays. May be Christmas holidays or need to use up ’UNUSED’ vacation which is not going to be added in the next year. Or just a casual refreshing trip back home. If you are planning to fly internationally, talk to a customer service agent on https://makemytrip.com before looking to purchase the tickets on any other airline websites. Most of the reviews that I came across on mouthshut, rather all of them have a dissappointing opinion. TO the extent that not to recommend it at all. Some have even gone ahead with calling them crooks. Could be true for them. But I MakeMyTrip.com View next photo had a nice experience purchasing a ticket through https://makemytrip.com. Just thought of sharing with my friends here. IT was the start of February 2006 and suddenly realised that I won’t have much to do in the coming weeks as my project coming to an end and would be busy again only after at least a month. What to do? I weighed the options with me, 1) You can wither away your time earning dollars by doing nothing or simply utilise the time to keep watching movies every day. 2) Instead spend some QUALITY time with family and friends at home. The second option was an instant boost which involved Air Travel. Usually its always like a recharge to visit home. But then it has to be worthwhile, can’t be at huge monetary cost. Add to that my Manager approved for the leave within a week’s notice on the condition that I would be back at work in three weeks time. That put me in a fix as I just had a week to plan for the trip. But the nice lady She was, understood her situation and decided to go ahead with my travel plans to return in exactly 3 weeks time. Anyways, what’s the next step? Buy the air ticket as you cannot travel without ticket in a flight or bribe the stewardess for reservations after boarding the Flight. Frankly, had no clue about buying/booking an airline ticket although had travelled by air before. All my previous travels had been company sponsored. So the travel department usually took care and even spoon fed what to take care about the process once the Ticket was handed over. Anyhow, had to be on my own now and get that ticket at a decent price. Googling my way with the best possible combinations to bring out an intelligent result for the best deal, chanced upon https://makemytrip.com. ALways believed whether it is professional or personal business, better to talk than mail. Yes, mail is effective sometimes when you have to deal after the DEAL is done. The website is pretty OK with the features and look and feel just like any other travel website. Experimented some search criteria to see how much would it cost me my yearly recharging trip. I tried almost all the criteria to check for the least possible price. And then after noting down the least price, called up the toll free number 1800-india10 that I found on the website and told the person(who will be referred to HE henceforth) on the other end about my need to get a direct return flight ticket to Hyd from Raleigh to travel in a weeks time. HE had a pleasing personality, could say that from his mature talk. HE kept me waited for about 5 minutes with my inhibitions growing up about the stupidity to rely on such a website found randomly while googling. Nevertheless, the wait was worthy. HE came back saying that he would offer me the best possible rate with less number of domestic flights both end. And that too through a premier airlines. I was really not that interested when he said that premier means Emirates Airlines. The price and the matching of travel dates were what mattered me more at that time and I just agreed saying that its OK and we came down to an agreement on ticket price. I told him to send me the itinerary. He gave a reservation code to check it online then and there itself. But it was on https://checkmytrip.com. Checked my itinerary, was not interested with the stopover of over 20 hours in Dubai on my return doing nothing. Thats when HE offered me the free stay in a ? Star hotel near Dubai Airport to rest my back during the break. Confirmed all the stuff with HIM and asked him mode of payment. With not enough credit history(bogus history) with my credit card here, told him that I would be better off paying by Check/Cheque and mentioned to him the Cheque number I had issued while talking over the phone. The next day as per the agent’s instructions, I faxed the check to the number he mentioned in New York. And in three days, I received my Ticket by mail. It was pretty straight forward and I was all Happy about it. Points to be noted, My Honour(some hints that might help): Talk to the Guy/Gal agent to send you the itinerary, Verify, Re-Confirm and ask for their name and contact number to reach at, if needed. Let them give you options available for day of travel, like a day or two here and there, you might end up saving quite some money which can be used for domestic travel later. Am still reluctant to pay over the net irrespective of India/Abroad even though issues can be sorted out later. But that kills lot of your QUALITY time. Beware of PAYPAL, its making inroads in INDIA too. Have not worked with any call centre or do not sympathise with any. But there is no harm talking in a cordial/friendly manner initially at least. You know I ended up getting free Taxi drop off from Hyderabad to any place around 30 kms of the Airport as compliment.:-) Remember the name of the agent you spoke to and ask confidently for that name from the toll free number as though you are his buddy. From the information I was shared, they are bunch of people sitting in an office in Delhi, so you would not be transferred to different places. How was the travel? +es==> Emirates service was great. No hassles all along. The complimentary taxi drop off in Hyderabad was really helpful especially when you arrive in the middle of the night, if you are lucky. The stopover in Dubai was great. I ended up doing a 6-hour Dubai Darshan with another 6 hour rest in the accomodation provided. And the food was simply great. -es==> The connecting flight in Dubai for Hyderabad is usually at a gap of less than an hour which is little uncomfortable, more so if you are travelling with kids/elders. Before your return journey, while confirming your tickets, please call at least 3-4 days before, the customer service is usually the airlines and makemytrip is already out of scene. All said, Internet is like a land filled with mines. You gotta make sure you are putting your feet on the right(safe) spot. In this case, it could be getting the right customer service agent.;-)",3
3438,"Its the worst site that I have ever seen. It takes hell lot of time to first search the best tickets and then it hangs at the time of credit card transaction for over 3 minutes. Without displaying anything what is happening. And these people are very slow in providing the services. I have complained about their itenary that it is not showing any details regarding the ticket I have purchased. And these people have not even replied me after even 48 hours. They have nither send me the e-ticket or the printed ticket. I cant even verify the tickets that I have booked. Its a very bad experience using makemytrip.com. This was the first time and the last time for me ,for using makemytrip. I will suggest you not to use MakeMyTrip.com to book your emergency tickets. Its better see what they say is the best and book it directly from the site of that particular airlines.",1
3439,"When internet aided travel boom first started in India in early Y2K, most websites were able to assist itinerary and ticket bookings as offline procedures. With the advent of online internet bookings, and increased security of internet transactions, came the boom in airline ticket bookings and most Air carriers enabled this feature on their websites to facilitate customers to book their tickets without going to a booking office. However, the process was a tedious one, especially because browsing through Airline websites was a time consuming exercise and a customer could not get instant comparative flight timings or rates. Make My Trip (MMT) was the first website to consolidate the sale of air tickets of almost all the Airlines operating in the domestic sector. Other similar websites like TravelGuru.com, Indiatimes.com/travel and now, Cleartrip.com followed. Eventually MMT has added hotel bookings, airport transfers, international air bookings and hotel packages to their repertoire. I have been an MMT customer for more than two years now. I have never had the opportunity to avail their services for airport transfers, or hotel bookings, but as far as domestic airline bookings go, I have never faced a problem with them. After I make my bookings, I receive the tickets by courier in less than two days. Their 24-hour call center is very friendly and professional. In the event of an unfortunate cancellation, the procedure followed was in accordance with the rules. Even though Indiatimes.com/travel has perhaps the cheapest (domestic) air tickets in their cluster, except of course the last minute deals offered on Airlines’ own websites, MMT is my favourite.",3
3440,"They have improved, especially in last few months. Now calls are not kept on hold that long, they are more polite and are more patient. offers quite a good options and thankfully have started to tranfer calls to concern department :) and unlike as mentioned in other reveiws they don't cheat you of your money, there can be delays in return but I doubt if they or any other online site refuse to return at all, though I never faced the same problem on this site All in all it can be derived from the reveiws that they don't have that a great after sales service i.e. they are not good at disaster recovery but one thing is match less is their price, I don't know how they do it but you will always find cheap fare compared to all other online portals... after all at the end of the day that's what we want, to save money isn't it !!!! :))",4
3441,"Hi, You would have seen the advertisements of this site on TV and in the print media, and the internet. My Advise: 1) The section for lowest airfare provides information on flight from all leading airlines at one shot and is a very useful feature (though it is slow and takes a few minutes to get the information). So you are spared the effort of going to individual sites and getting the price. 2) As far as the packages are concerned, you should carefully evaluate other travel providers before choosing a package. Don't just blindly take the package take a quote from some other service provider 3) Information, the site is packed with information is intuitive and user friendly.  The site has information on travel destinations, travel itinaries and various packages which makemytrip.com has assembled. 4) You should go and check other sites also and compare the prices with other competitors and other offline agents. 5) They offer you a moneyback offer in case you are not satisfied, do read the fine print though. I would definitely suggest a visit to the site for anyone wanting to travel. But compare the prices before you buy.",3
3442,"Stay away from this site... you can book the same flight(s)from Expedia or from the airline site for a slightly higher price but that’swhat reliability is worth.

I said cancelmy transaction I will not be sending my credit card details and she charged meanyway. I never sent my credit card copy but got charged anyway. I am not sureabout how people in Indiafeel about this site but for US travelers this comes across as highlycomplicated website to book a ticket.

I waited for the ticket for next 3 days .. after that I enquired from makemytrip support personel and was told, this fare basis is only applicable for Indian nationals and  I would have to re-book the tkt . with the US resident fare basis. Note: I did not know till then there exist  two tier pricing one for Indian resident and other for non-indian resident. I have never seen such a stupid policy in any country as yet ! I instant message makemytrip travel personal in India and they told me they will have to cancel the booking and will cost the cancellation fees of  Rs. 2000. I tried to reason out with their support personal, since the paper tkt by Air India have not been issued, so why are you charging me the cancellation fees. why not  just used my balance to ward the new booking.  they would not obliged in the end went ahead with the cancellations. Now the problem I see if my US credit card is charged with more than $ US 110. If I calculate the  Rs 2000 cancellation fees should equal $ 45. but they have charged me double.

3444,"Hi , Booking a ticket on makemytrip.com was the worst mistake of my life. The customer care is horrible. Never trust what they say, they always speak lies.They will make you false promises for delivery of ticket and finally if you have to catch the flight you have to go the their corporate office in Delhi and get the ticket. They told me for 4 days that they will deliver the ticket next day and finally I have to go to Delhi to collect the ticket from there office. And Most important never give your credit card's CCV number on the phone to MakeMytrip's DEVIL (executive) they can do any thing with it. never trust them. At the end I will like recommend you not to ever book your ticket by makemytrip.com. If you do it they you will have to suffer for sure so don't use it or be prepared for harresment. Happy Traveling",1
3445,Do not EVER BOOK YOUR TICKETS AT THIS SITE... WE BOOKED TICKETS & THE TICKETS were received ONE DAY AFTER THE FLIGHT AT FIRST THESE PPL SAID THEY WOULD REFUND THE MONEY & AFTER 2 WEEKS THEY ARE PUTTING THE BLAME ON THE CUSTOMER THEY THINK CUSTOMERS ARE IDIOTS BEWARE & STAY AWAY FRM THESE GUYS. IT is much better to go to the sites of airlines or to the counters straight than going through these fraudsters. I would like to know like minded people who wish to sue these guys for their clumsiness & inefficiency. WE SHOULD ALSO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OTHERS COME TO KNOW OF THEIR TERRIBLE REPUTATION & STAY AWAY FROM THESE CON MEN. once again : WE SHOULD ALSO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OTHERS COME TO KNOW OF THEIR TERRIBLE REPUTATION & STAY AWAY FROM THESE CON MEN.

3446,"I booked a to-and-fro ticket on makemytrip.com I was horrified to see later that they had booked it 3 times and charged the same (3 times the fare) to my credit card. When I called them up, they said that it was a software error and that the money will be redunded back. It has been 2 months since then and numerous calls to their call center.  My money has not been refunded yet. Everytime I call up, they tell me that it is a problem with the accounts department and that they have asked them to look at the issue with high priority.   I am also assured that it will be closed in 5 working days.  It is interesting to note that the same story is repeated by everybody who picks up the phone and net result is also the same.. nothing happens. I would advise people to stay away from makemytrip where you suffer from their software errors and extremely careless attitude of their customer care center. I am planning to go through the hassles of consumer court.  If you want to buy all these troubles, feel free to go ahead and buy a ticket on their site.",1
3447,"We did a hotel booking with Makemytrip.com last month. We called them up later to confirm and they told us it is enough to just report at the hotel. When we reached the hotel they said they did not get any communication on our booking. The hotel still honored our booking because they had unoccupied rooms. If they didn't have any rooms available probably we would have had to go elsewhere and later go through the hassle of getting a refund from Makemytrip.com. So on the whole I did not find this online booking site very reliable. The positive thing is I could do the booking online and pay through credit card. But once the booking is done there is no confirmation from them. There is no way to know whether the booking succeeded, whether you have rooms blocked for you, etc. The only way to know is to call them up. So half the purpose of an online booking is already defeated. In addition the guys on the phone are clueless.",2
3448,"MakeMyTrip, launched in 2000, has grown at a fast pace toemerge as the leading travel company for travel from USAto India. “Lowest Airfare Guarantee” with which its website was launched has disappeared. I find the arifares on this website expensive among all similar websites. I haven’t booked a flight with them since last December simplybecase I always get a better deal else ware. Other excellent services offered include Hotel Reservations: They have gone the greedy way here also.The reservations were never in budget although I have to say I used this serviewhen it was peak season. Car rentals: Living in India I know that their rental pricesare soaring high, but I suppose this service is mainly for foreign tourists. The only section I have been using it for these days is a section called 'road trip' it gives a detailed plan and stopovers to nearest destination from your point of origin. I use it to get a basic idea for  planning weekend breaks. The alternative Website to makemytrip which is really impressive these days is travelguru.com although I am still on the lookout for other decent travel portals. Travelguru is highly recommended for international bookings as well. Looking at some of the information I found else ware MM T seemto be doing really well. About the organization: MakeMyTrip was launched in 2000 as an online travel companycatering to the USAto Indiamarket. The company grew by over 75% to register sales of over Rs 100crores in the fiscal year ending March 2005. For the current year, MakeMyTripis on track to achieve sales of Rs 200 crores. Headquartered at New Delhi, MakeMyTrip has served over 40,000 NRI’s in thelast five Years, has a registered database of 125,000 NRI’s and has animpressive year-on-year customer renewal rate of 30%. SoftBank Asia InfrastructureFund (SAIF) recently boosted the company’s growth plans with an investment of Rs 45crores. SAIF currently manages a series of funds with over US$900 million incommitments and has invested in MMT to fund the latter’s expansion plans in India and US",3
3449,"For people who like to travel with ease & money is not a big deal for them, here is site for them.  What I am saying is very true, the site is good only for high flyers, you can never get a proper flight details for places which do not come under theMETROdistinction (eg- Bhubneshwar,Cochin,Panji etc), even though there might be an direct flight from your source to that of the required destination it hardly shows that, it will show connecting flights from the METRO's. For example I wanted a flight detail from Bangalore to Bhubneshwar, which has a direct flight but it never showed it, instead it showed connecting flights from Delhi. it even doesn't show the connecting flights from other places other than that of the four metros. But if you call them up on the givencustomer care numberthey provide you with every possible detail(which includeslow priceflights), which I had to do in my case. They give you proper details with hassle free bookings(if you are a credit card holder) & the ticket is emailed to you right away followed by aconfirmation mailfrom the flight company.  So if you want to buy anything from this site its better to to call em up & get it booked. Now coming to their hotel's just repeat the top sentence, I never got a proper hotel(within my budget) for my stay in goa through this site. In the end  all I can say is that, even though the site is easy to use, but the information given in the site is not upto the mark, where as the customer suport given to you when you call em up is good. There are other sites to look out likeyatra.comwhich has an upper hand to this site as it has an option in the flight for +-2 days in getting the details, & it shows the direct flight(atleast for bangalore-bhubneshwar it did). Hope the details are good enough, bye & happy journey",4

3451,"DO NOT EVER BOOK YOUR TICKETS FROM THESE PEOPLE. I REPEAT DO NOT .....YOU WILL BE BETTER OFF BUYING DIRECTLY FROM AIRLINE WEBSITES, ORBITZ OR ANYBODY FOR THAT MATTER.  THEY WILL GO TO ANY EXTENT TO CHEAT YOU OF YOUR MONEY. I have not come across any other company who rips off people like these people do. I made reservations for my annual vacation from this company for the first time ever and I had the worst experience ever.  They quoted me a fare assuring me that they are giving me the best deal. I asked them a few times to confirm that there was no better deal than the one they were giving me and they insisted that I was getting the best deal.  I made the payment instantly because they would not accept any other kind of payment other that credit card payments so, I did not think twice and bought my tickets.  A few hours later I checked their own website (mind you this is their own website and not even any other travel agent) and they had fares for the same date, same sector for $150 less so, basically I was ripped off of $600 as I had bought 4 tickets. Called a couple of  travel agents here in the U.S and both of them quoted me approx. $160 less per ticket as well. You can imagine how horrible I felt. Never in my life I have lost that much money in a matter of hours. When I called the company and mentioned this to them they made all kinds of excuses. I asked them to cancel my tickets or give me refund for the difference. They woudn't do either.  Finally after talking to the supervisor for 70 minutes he agreed to give me a small part of the diference.....I still lost approximately $400.  I guess they are thought to sell the highest fare available and won't even mention if there is anything else available out there. So, be smart and stay away. don't get attracted by all those ads that you see............they are there just to rip-off , rob, and fraud people.",1
3452,"NEVER use makemytrip.com for any travel bookings. They are slow, unprofessional, and rest assured it will be a decision you will regret. We booked tickets from India to NY , and had to cancel them later because of some health issues my mother had. The tickets got cancelled, but the refund still has not come through to our account. It's a fairly large amount, and we have paid the credit card company HUGE amounts of interest on the oustanding loan. Each time we call makemytrip, the customer service tell us that the refund should be through any time. It has been 2.5 months since this, and there is still no money in our account. I wonder if they plan to refund us at all or not. In a nutshell, you will be doing yourself a great favour by not booking your tickets through makemytrip. Pathetic service.They should be banned from operating.",1
3453,"I was very impressed with MakeMyTrip recently. I had to fly from Bangalore to Delhi on business and logged on to their website to buy a ticket. I got a really good deal on Indigo and Jet. The Etickets for both arrived in my mailbox within an hour of me completing the booking and signing off. I would definitely use these guys again. Actually I was quite surprised to read the negative stuff about them on MS. My experience was great and I think it's unfair to write them off as some of the MS users have. MakeMyTrip is after all only trying to help consumers by making booking of tickets and hotels easy by doing it online instead of waiting for a quote from a travel agent or calling a hotel for their tariff plan and availibility. They were recommended to me by someone and needless to say, I'll be recommending them to other people as well.",5
3454,"I have used these guys twice and both times were unpleasant. The first one (about 3 years ago) was bad and the second outright fraudulent. My first trip was for travel Chicago-London-chicago. They first ffered me a round trip fare on AA for $540 and I paid using my CC. I waited for my ticket but it never arrived. Whn I called them they told me that price had gone up by $100 but anyways I decided to pay. I was promised next day delivery by Fedex but that never happened. Then made another 10 calls and my ticket was deliverd after 1 week. I chose to look at this incident as an isolated case. The second time was a booking I tried making five days ago. My travel was to take me LA-Taipei-Sin-Mumbai-Frankfurt-chicago. They quoted a fare close to $3500 which I was okay with and asked him to HOLD the ticket. I said I would like to not reveal my financial information over the telephone and would prefer sending a signed check to their NY office. The guy over the phone assured that there was no reason to worry and I could give him my routing number and account number over the phone and then fax my check and that only after receiving my check they would clear the payment and then issue the ticket which would take 14 days upon my confrmation to buy. I was in no hurry so I gave him my financial information and told him to hold the ticket and wait till he received my check by fax. It so turned out that these guys even before receiving my check ran the transatcion for $4000 and my checking account was debited by that amount within 12 hours. There was no authorization to purchase. My bank lets me know of this. So I call these morons up who insis I have bought the ticket and if I want edto cancel the ticket I would need to pay a penalty of $1000.  I requested they transfer me to the IDIOT Deep Kalra but they refused. So the next day I go to my bank, put a stop payment , had to close my checking a/c to prevent these fraudsters from running checks with new serial numbers and my bank refunded the money. Then a fool from MMT customer service calls me up and says sorry and then pleads me into buying the ticket. And the conversation goes 'So sir do buy from us, we are happy to serve you, how much are you willing to pay?'. Here I am furious that they charged my account without authorization and now they indulge in price negotiation tactics. I realized these guys in reality are no cheaper than others and if you are willing to pay 5% more you can be assured that atleast your financial information will remain safe. MORAL: NEVER EVER share your financial information with MAKEMYTRIP. Deep Kalra and his useless call center guys have serious BUSINESS ETHICS issues. I think these guys are inc in delhi that is why they manage to get away with fraud. I hope their NY dispatch office is raided sometime. K",1
3455,MakeMyTrip.Com is one of the more popular internet avenues forbookingairline tickets. I used it in July for my travel between SanFranciscoand Bangalore. I was somehow not convinced that the best dealswereseen online so I decided to chat with them live and it was alittletedious to keep up to their slow pace on gathering requirementswhich Iwouldnt blame them for anyways. Then I decided to givethem a call on their toll free number and theiragent came up with somevery attractive deals. I ended up buying theticket from them as theycould mix and match the various combinationsand eventually give me aticket that was not too expensive and the onewhich had reasonabletransit times. The ticket was shipped to me on time and all theintermediateinformation they provided was pretty much accurate. I wouldthink thatthey can still improve their site content to a great extentand alsomake it a little more interactive and user friendly. Howevertheir online chat as well as their phone services are quitegood anddoes help in making some quick decisions with regard totickets.Definitely they are able to provide better prices as comparedto a lotof travel agents we know of.

3456,"This is  promoted a lot....any website, any newspaper..all magazines..they have space... Services are prompt as per delivery goes...but sometimes u might have to do follow-ups. I booked flight tickets 3 times..First time..it was prompt.. Second and third I had to send e-mails since they do not have local Tel no where u can reach them.. Check before confirming the tickets becuase all the rates displayed are excluding Airport taxes. So if u click for a flight of indian airlines costing  4999/- from Mumbai to delhi..it actually costs you Rs 4999/- + Rs 950/- As far as the hotel rate goes, it looks attractive but it is not. If you check with respective hotel directly, you will get better rates. Because makemytrip.com's commission will be excluded. It certainly is very convienient since you get all the choices under one roof and need not look for respective hotels/airline websites. Eg,  Before Jet Airways was not having online booking facility and e-ticket printing facility. But you could book the same through makemytrip.com",3
3457,"I recently booked a Mumbai-Patna ticket on makemytrip.com, as I suddenly had to go there for a presentation and no tickets were available either with the travel agent or Jet Airways website (the IC and Sahara timings did not match so Jet was the only option). There was no direct flight so I booked a 5:00 p.m. Mumbai-Delhi flight & 7:25 p.m. Delhi-Patna flight. This booking was done less than 24 hrs before my journey. I had to call these people up repeatedly to get my e-ticket. First someone told me, it'll be emailed within 2 hrs; next time they told me within 24 hrs, to which I reminded them that my journey was just abt 20 hrs away. At this, the guy tells me, ok ur flight is tomorrow evening, so please call us tomorrow morning at 9.30 a.m., remind us to email the ticket and we'll do that. I was flabbergasted; I asked him if they aren't supposed to send it on their own; he was like, yes, but we're supposed to be giving it in 24-48 hrs, so u pls call us. Thankfully I took my PNR No. from this guy. I dutifully called them next morning ... and yes, calling them is a nightmare in itself ... be prepared to waste at least 30 mins ... even at 12.30 in the night! So after my call, an e-ticket was sent to me, but my outgoing flight was mentioned as 3.50 p.m, instead of 5.00 p.m ... another round of call, and I was put on hold for almost 10 mins, after which I was told that the ticket had been sent to me ""by mistake"" and they will be sending me another one within the hour. Sure enough, I recd. another email, but with someone else's ticket, that too on Delhi-Mumbai sector! Wonder whose ticket they sent that poor fellow! I realised it was useless to pursue it any further with makemytrip, so I called Jet, got a confirmation on my bookings, and did a web check in as well. Use the site only if u have no other option, and some time in hand. The better part of my night and day was wasted in all this nonsense.",2
3458,"After reading all the negative reviews I must narrate the good experience I have had with makemytrip.com . I was abroad when I booked domestic tickets from Mumbai to Delhi for myself and a friend. We chose to travel Air-India (domestic sector) since we were arriving at Mumbai from abroad and it saved a change of terminal. During the transaction I gave a local Delhi No as contact tele. About 30 min after booking (and money debited from my creditrcard), a person from makemytrip called up my friend at Delhi and said that the tickets which we had booked were not available. However he offered to put us on the next available flight (Air Sahara). They did so and even paid the difference in cost (total about Rs 1300) for both tickets. Thje tickets were delivered promptly within 3 days to the address in Delhi. However on another occasion, they did not list the flight on which another website (yatra.com) was offtering lower rates. Both these events are of Sep-Oct 06 and so very recent. Their response on toll free Nos leaves much to be desired. Maybe they can improve that. Quite often when one chooses a flight and clicks to proceed for ticketing, the message of 'this flight is no longer available at the fare you have chosen appears'. Maybe they require to pay more attention to updating their database.",3
3459,Make My Trip.com started its operations 6 years back with a small office and 6-7 employes and the guys were just into outsourcing business. It has been 6 years since they begun their operations and now it is a 35 crore annual profit making company leaving behind Google last year. At first they were only into the US markets catering to NRI's and US citizens but now they have Australia and Domestic India as well. You can not find cheap holidays as offered by MakeMyTrip. I understand that all 100 % customers cannot satisfy themselves but even if 80 % have a good experience then I will say that company is doing good as without it it cannot make such huge profits. When I was to choose my package I went to so many agents but most had high prices. Later I took  quoatation from MakemyTrip and they provided me excellent service. I was fully satisfied as The amount invested with them was worth. If any company will recieve 300 calls daily then one cannot expect that all will be happy but if most are catered nicely and they go back satisfied then as per me it is performing very good. I have also seen the fares on Travelocity and Orbitz and I must say that first of all they have no service orientation and they do not provide 24/7 environment. Also what ever the company claims it gives. So Try using the website MakeMyTrip.com and see the difference yourself after all no one is better judge than ourselves.,3
3460,"Only book with them if you have time to listen to their most courteous bull crap. I was trying to book a pair of round trip tickets for me and my future wife, for a much anticipated honeymoon.  I already booked my hotels and I was trying to get air tickets to get there.  To my big disappointment, I was informed by Indian Airlines that the flight for those days that I needed were booked up and is like that for that whole week.  I was thrilled when I found out that makemytrip.com had tickets available for those days on that Indian airlines flight.  I purchased the tickets on September 04, 2006 and was told I will be getting my tickets in a week.  A week passed and no tickets so I called them on Sep 11 and their friendliest staff told me that the tickets will be shipped that day itself and I should receive it in three days.  No phone call and no tickets and I called them back on Sep 15.  Same answer and this time the lady told me they will send the tickets that day and she will even email me the tracking number.  Three days passed no email no tickets, so called back again on Sep 19.  At this point I was getting very worried as I already booked the hotel and I thought my honeymoon was going down the drains.  When I called that day they told me that they had an issue with Indian airlines computer and they are unable to get the PNR number and all they could do is wait for the ticket to be issued.  But I was assured it will be shipped by the end of the week latest.  A week passed and I called back again on Sep 26.  Same old story, I was told the tickets are issued and will be shipped that day.  October 6th and still no tickets.  Called back again and a gentleman told that the tickets were shipped the day before using bluedart and I asked him for a tracking number.   Tracked the shipment in bluedarts webpage and they confirmed that the parcel was send.  Got the tickets a week after it was shipped and I went to bluedarts office to pick it up contrary to makemytrip.com's claim that they will do to door delivery.  At this point I am just happy that I got the tickets. The site is a great one if they could live up to the expectations, compared to orbits and travelocity there are no comparison.  Their customer service is always accessible and the staff just keeps on telling you that everything is great.  If I didn't have to go thru the hazard of getting my tickets right away I would have said that this is a great site, but it seems like this kind of mishaps is a pattern for this site after reading other reviews. I would say it's just best to go with a local travel agent.   This site could have been a great one for NRI's who wants to plan their vacations ahead.  But you be the Judge.",2
3461,"My experience with makemytrip has been nothing short of nightmarish. I had booked my tickets to India some 3 years back through them and wanted an open return ticket so I could move my return dates around. They booked me a ticket where Lufthansa clearly stated in their itinerary that the dates cannot be moved, and when I asked makemytrip about this, they said, its fine go ahead and book it, I just had to call their office 2 days before my scheduled return flight and they would move it as I wanted. Remember, this is before I consented. When I called them a good week before my scheduled flight and wanted the dates postponed by a week, guess what they said, the dates are not flexible. When I countered them about my communication, giving the name of the person I had spoken to, they promptly denied it. Then they suggested that I take a separate one-way ticket through them and they would communicate with Lufhtansa and get it refunded. Though, skeptical, I took their bait as I didn't have too much of a choice. Then upon returning, when I called them, as I had thought, they again denied that there as a conversation in that regard. I sent letter after letter to every one of their executives, right from their Manager to the call-center guy, but I never got my 1200 dollars back. My friends had similar experiences too, almost in every site theymention of the 700 dollar round trip tickets to Mumbai, but when youcall them they quote a good 5% more than even the local travel agent. When asked about their advertisement, they say only a few tickets aresold that price. My two cents, unless you are in the middle of nowhere or you just won yourself a lottery. PLEASE AVOID makemytrip. I generally think of makemytrip, when I go to the gym to get my adrenaline up.",1
3462,"Although, a good pioneering approach, but a lack ofvisibility in terms of User Interface and growing competition has made the site lose it's luster. Totop that, instead of simple drop down menus, the use of Pop-Out Javascript has madefew browsers incompatible adding to the frustration of inexperienced users. Instead of bashing the company I'll make a fewsuggestions through which the company can improve: 1) Keep the website clean 2) Make it uncluttered - Remember, you're not running a community message board 3) Focus on Processes to guide your company's internal working - Become ProcessOriented 4) Focus on Customers - Because of them you're in business 5) Send out customer satisfaction questioner to better streamline the process 6) Make Internet and Phone booking synchronized, so if online transactionfails, it gives a Transaction ID to the user, which the user can tell thecompany's representative over the phone to continue the transaction where hehad left 7) Pay attention to your business, but even more so to the competition 8) Each company has its strengths and weaknesses, leverage your strengths, knowand work on eliminating your weaknesses 9) Innovate!!! Focus on one thing at a time and I'm sure that if the company followes the above suggestion, they can again retain their top crown. Good luck Makemytrip.com",2
3463,"You always have to run to your airticket booking agent? He charges you extra? And you later realize the deal which you got could have been much better... Don't feel cheated any more...You have the power of internet and websites like""Makemytrip.com"" pretty handy! Not only do they promise o give the cheapest fares across airlines...they have got a lot of major airlines tied up with them and there efficient search engine gives you a perfect blend of airlines with different timings and variable rates. So you can effectively make a tradeoff between time and price! The good part is the easy payment options, you can easily pay thorough a credit card and get the ticket delivered at your doorstep as well as you have the option of getting an e-ticket and just a rint out would suffice! Well one attractive feature of the web site is, the moment you book a ticket you get a SMS alert in the mobile number mentioned by you while booking an you immediately get an email itenary into your email. One another feature is that if you plan to cancell the ticket at a later time, there are some standard deductions one and you get the amount refunded back to your creit card! What else would you want o have from a air ticket booking agency! And ya this all at no extra costs!!! I have personally bought the tickets from this sight quite a few times and the experience has been good! Two things which I want o warn you, 1) While buying the ticket there are some prces which are displayed which might not be updated, so double check the prices once you finalie the flight. 2) Sometimes while making the online payments make sure that you don't refresh the page...which is the general norm for the Online transaction. I guess all these things might help you to make a decision! Cheers:)",3
3464,"GUYS DON'T BE FOOLED WITH THEIR SO CALLED ATTRACTIVE AIRFARES TO INDIA I had 2(TWO) bad experiences through MakeMyTrip.com (1)First experience was in Dec. 2001 when I bought an Air Ticket to New Delhi, India from Dallas, TX. They quoted 1300 USD and I agreed to it and made payment in cash. After that, they sent me a fax and email confirmation showing my booked airtickets with seats assigned to me and the confirmation number. Then, TWO DAYS prior to my flight departure date, they call me to let me know the price of the ticket has changed and they need me to submit $250 more or else they are going to cancel my tickets. I was so upset but I guess they had controlled the situation and it was too late for me to buy my ticket at a good rate in just 2 days. So, I end up paying a total of $1550 for my ticket! Today October 15th, 2006, I am having difficulty dealing with them yet another time. Exact same situation and here I am in the middle of nowhere. I made the payments already but these GREEDY DOGS want more money. So, they are asking another $300 after I paid for the ticket using my credit card.GUYS STAY AWAY FROM MAKE MY TRIP, if you really want to travel without a headache.

3465,"Two years on, and I tried MakeMyTrip again. Some people just like pain, and looks like I'm one of them. 1) Ticketing is unreliable : sell you tickets that are not available. 2) Terrible processes : They say my ticket was sold in their systems at the same moment the last ticket on the airline systems was allocated to someone else.  Yet they take 1 1/2 days to inform me about the problem. Cleartrip Zindabad. Never again on MakeMyTrip. My review of 2006 below : A great site when they started out, it seems these folks are either taking Indian consumers for a ride, or have a saddist view on customer service. Having grown comfortable with makemytrip (even using their early live customer service where representatives from Delhi would call you to plan your trips), I made a reservation for a Mumbai - Bangalore flight which I subsequently had to cancel.  This reservation was made prior to 24th August 2006.  I'd called the support line to enquire why the refund was not yet effected, and was informed it would happen 'shortly'.  It's now about 45 days since that cancellation and still no refund to my account. Always wanting to support e-commerce businesses in India, (and perhaps hinting at a inherent senileness), I made a subsequent reservation on 6th Oct 2006, only to find that I was charged twice. Today's Diwali, and I thought  would call them up to wish them a Happy Diwali.  There was prompt response and a plesant voice (just like it was in their early days), but I believe their support protocol necessitated a break for a Diwali cracker, as I was put on hold for more than 5 minutes before I decided enough was enough. I googled MakeMyTrip and it's so sad that there is so much negative reviews of a portal that was at one time a leader in their space.  Being in the travel and tourism industry, they should have thought twice about the importance of customer service.  This does not seem to be their priority any more, and the experience is so disappointing, it just, quite literally, screws your day.",1
3466,"I cant believe that I got conned into believing this site for booking tickets!! Please note that at the end of this review I have added a list of  email addresses that you could use to address your complaints because I know you will need it with MakeMyTrip.com Iam normally a very cautious person ( make that extra cautious!!). I had to book tickets from bombay to bangalore for my parents and sisters family. I got taken by all their advertising glitz and checked the site out. They had a toll free number listed which I called. I was greeted by Prasoon Kandpal. After getting the details of the tickets he suggested I book for a spice jet ticket since they were giving the best fares for the date of travel. I agreed. as part of the procedure I gave my credit card no. and cvv no. after confirming the ticket fare he proceeded to debit my card. Now comes the BIG shock. he says mam I forgot to charge the transaction fee- 120 rs. per ticket. I ask him what is this- he says it is charged by the spicejet airlines and it is nothing extra charged by makemytrip.com. I am suspicious and immediately logonto the net ( I was sitting with my laptop open). I check fares given and there is no mention of any transaction charges. Infact 2 other sites travelguru and travel.indiatimes.com are offering lower fares!!! that was shock no. 2. Now Prasoon tells me "" mam I have already debited cannot reverse. but makemytrip guarantees that if u get a cheaper fare we will return double the difference'. I reconfirm a 100 times with him and he repeats the same. I fall for the line - BIGGEST MISTAKE. After the transaciton is done ( since CVV is already given I have no choice but to accept whatever charges he debits!), I immediately mail him the screen shots from the other sites. then started the LONG wait, umpteen emails and phone calls- all from my side. NOBODY responds. No answers given. NOBODY is bothered since I have already paid for the tickets!! FINALLY I get Prasoon on the line and ask him- he says he forgot to mention that they charge transaction charges over phone bookings. THATS It- FORGOT TO MENTION!! so thats the story for you- MORAL- NEVER TRUST FALSE PROMISES ON TV/ WEBSITE AND BEWARE TO APPROACH SUCH CON-MEN POSING AS TICKET AGENTS-- LOWEST FARES MY FOOT!!    This has left such a bad impression!! MAKEMYTRIP ofcourse isnt bothered!! So the least I can do is warn fellow travellers of the pitfalls. Also want to take this up with Consumer Action Group (CAG)  for false  and misleading advertisments, wilfull fraud and deficient ( non-existent!!) customer service and causing heartburn and feeling so cheated and frustrated!!! I had to give a one star but would have preferred giving NEGATIVE rating!! Here is a list of email addresses that you can forward your complaints to : geeta.eral@makemytrip.com  - Manager, Customer service If the above person does not reply , please email the top management below: deep.kalra@makemytrip.com   -  CEO Keyur.Joshi@makemytrip.co  - Chief Operating Officer sachin.bhatia@makemytrip.com -  Chief Marketing Officer sanjeev.bhasin@makemytrip.com  -   Head, Operations We got immediate response from makemytrip.com after we emailed the top management. so all of u who faced problems should mail your complaints to Geeta- that way they will know that customers cannot be taken for granted. I think all of us should get together to teach these companies a few valuable lessons on customer service!! they will also think twice before making any claims which they have no intention to match! also must say thatmouthshut.comis a good forum for us to post our real-life experiences and for people to make informed decisions about products/ services etc. Keep up the good work!!",1
3467,"I liked their user interface and so give it a shot forbooking a return trip for my wife from Bangaloreto Delhi. Firstirritant was that they don’t have Air Deccan flights in their listing, secondwas that the prices shown are exclusive of taxes and often change by the time uare ready to pay. After all this I still went ahead and booked but had tocancel a few days later due to personal reasons. First the guy actually told methat I have to surrender 50% of ticket value and when I hit the roof, he keptme on hold for forever and came back to say that its done (I still lost 1500/-out of 8207/-). That was not the end of my misery, it has been a month now anddespite countless calls (which themselves are a pain as its difficult to getthrough), I haven't got my money back. The credit card company has alreadycharged me and I am really pissed now. These jokers have no business beingallowed in this business. It’s a pity that despite having a good businessmodel, these guys have such pathetic service model.",1
3468,"I am a satisfied customer of MakeMyTrip so far. In the last eighteen months, I have booked a total of 8 flight tickets, all domestic flights in the Kolkata - Mumbai - Delhi sector, mostly in Jet Airways/Air-India/Indian Airlines/Kingfisher. Each time I have paid through my credit card, so far I have not faced any problems/fraudulent operations with any credit card payments. Every time I have received the ticket delivered to my office desk, in a nice waterproofed package via courier, within three working days of booking. Connection-wise, I use a 256 Kbps BSNL Broadband at home and a 1 MBPS connection at office, so page loads and payment gateway transactions are pretty acceptable in terms of connection speed. I have also seen their after sales service - and it is equally bad or good as any other customer service provider in India - be it cellphone or bank or credit-cards. Due to some unforeseen circumstances I missed a flight, and I was standing in Mumbai airport well past midniight, totally disturbed, and had to figure out what to do next. I called up their 24/7 helpline number, which responded after a 3-minute hold (as the polite recorded voice kept saying ""they were experiencing very high call volumes""). But after the wait was over, they DID help me. They reached out to get all the info for me and guided me in the process of cancellation/refund of the ticket, and also advised on which flights are available next which I can opt for immediately. Also, they boast that they can give you the cheapest tickets. I disagree with this. For a particular day and flight, I have purchased tickets that's cheaper than what's available here.. When I need to book a ticket, I do the following: Open Indiatimes auctions and check out the ticket I want, and if available, the current bid amount. Normally option #1 is the cheapest in 90% of the cases. But that is an auction and no surity until I win at EOD and get the print-out of the e-ticket. So I go to Deccan, Kingfisher and Jet Airways websites and proceed to do an online booking. They never give you the total cost of the ticket (Fare + Taxes) until the final check-out page (just before you have to give Credit card details and make payment), so I go all thru and find out the final cost. I go to MakeMyTrip and check out the flight fare. This is the easiest step among all the above. Many a times, I get a cheaper ticket in option #3 then what is available in MakeMyTrip. If all the options (1 to 3) fails, I buy a ticket from MakeMyTrip, and be happy with it, knowing well that no other travel agent would be able to give cheaper than this.",3

I could not do it as it kept asking for 4 digit CCV number even though VISA credit card has only 3 digits and I have entered it correctly. So I had no option but to book it on phone. Every thing was fine when I booked the ticket.  Phone call was picked immediately and ticket booking went smooth. But my post sales experience was horrible.  When I got my credit card statement, I was shocked to see that I was charged twice for the same air ticket. I called customer service, they respond immediately for new bookings but when I choose post sales, I was put on hold for a lonnnnnnnggggg time. Then I was aksed to send an email to service dept.  IT has been 2 weeks since I have sent the mail and I have not received any reply from them yet. Their search engine is also very bad.  They advertise about their lowest price guarantee so much but what is the point of that guaranteee if they do not cover all the airlines or atleast the airlines which provide cheap fare. e.g. air deccan.",1

I searched for a flight on their  site for Bangalore to New Delhi for 29th April, 2006, and I could  find the following flight, which suited me well.

Then I  called them again and asked to cancel the same ticket and they told that  they will charge 750 Rs (500 for Sahara and 250 for their site) for this, I  told them that it’s the fault of your site and that’s the reason I want to  cancel this one and at least I am not eligible for paying this 250 Rs.

3472,"An update after my below review After juggling hard with the customer care call center I got in touch with one of the Shift Managers (I am avoiding to write his name) and he proved to be very cooperative. He worked hard to juggle out Tickets for us and finally we got the confirmed Tickets again. Moral of the story - keep your own sense open and dont trust on service providers blindly I want to thanks this guy at MMT whose cooperation got us back in business!! +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ So this is another sad story from a person who himself run an online travel biz!! on 22nd June I booked few Air Tickets by calling up MMT. Some Vishal Gupta attended me and after juggling here and there I finally got my and friend’s tickets booked for Delhi-KL-Singapore-Delhi. I was instantly charged out of my Credit Card.  I recieved a PNR and Reservation number which said I have a confirmed Reservation. On 25th June when I was expecting my Tickets I called up shitty customer service and I was informed that its only E-Tickets that I will recieve via Email and they have already sent it (which I never got). I asked them to resend it and this happened for next 3 DAYS!!! Meanwhile I had to cancel 1 passenger’s ticket out of 3 so I mailed them with specific instrutions to which they never replied. Not even till today Okay, I kept patience and again called up on 1st July BINGO!!! another so called customer care exectutive (somebody Kusum) informed me that  our Tickets got Waitlisted. I was taken aback and asked how its possible to get on waitlist from confirmation?? Now comes their excuses 1 by 1 I said wat the heck is reconfirmation when I have already paid you I showed them the email where I asked SPECIFICALLY to cancel only 1 ticket that too was on a different PNR and on diff airlines. OKAY! OKAY! enough is enough... I asked them send me Courier’s consignment code and a copy of Tickets. They had nuffin to say except sir, give us some time and we shall revert back witha  solution Its been 3rd day now I am begging them like anythin to confirm my Ticket, despite the fact that I can startight away lodge a case against them in Consumer Forum. (This is a business Trip and I have to fly on 8th July at any cost). Now whenever I call up MMT, a diferent executive picks up the phone and make excuse that I cant speak to the pesron who was looking into this case earlier!!! I would seriously recommend all of you to NOT use such a crap and frustating services. Rather go for a Travel Agent where you can atleast trace a responsible person and speak to him for any concerns.

But the airline is telling me that the amount has been sent to Makemytrip) And they have only one office in India that is given to be in Delhi, totally inasseable for the person staying elsewhere. if anybody out there know any place I can meet this guy who runs the show pl tell me. so that I can actually give a piece of my mind.",1
3474,"This is the first review of any kind I'm writing, and I certainly hope someone benefits from the sufferings I've experienced with makemytrip. I used makemytrip to make an international booking from Delhi to LA in late March, 2006. Due to difficulties in getting a visa, I had to postpone my trip by 2 days, for which I had to make a fresh booking and cancel the earlier one. Makemytrip had to return Rs. 39,000/- to me for my cancelled ticket and the ""customer care"" executive told me that it would take a month for the accounting department to process the cheque. A month later, I wrote to him asking him for an update about the same, to which he replied that he would look into the matter. Several reminders and identical responses later, he just stopped replying to my mails. Escalating the issue to the next level after about a month, I was mailed by a very apologetic ""Customer Delight"" manager, who assured me that she was ""personally looking into the issue"" and I would get the cheque at the earliest. Different person and a more fancy designation, but an identical experience. It has now been exactly 3 months since my flight and 2 months since I first started interacting with the ""support"" people at makemytrip, and I'm still being told that they will soon get me my cheque from the accounts department. That I'm not going to use their service again goes without saying. I'm only hoping that I get my money back for this time atleast.",1

Whenever I called (may be 20 times) I was told that I will be called back in half hour...I spent so much time and energy in making these calls. It seems that these guys are not interested in getting customers. Some one Ms. Ankita Wadhwa is clearly a fraud . If I can get hold of the CEO of this company , I am gonna take these guys to task.

3477,"In these days of flight travel having become dead cheap, not only that you have countless choices of flights but the offers of various airlines are also limitless ! = = = = = My Experience = = = = = A couple of months ago, when my mother-in-law was to fly to Detroit, my friend recommended that I browse throughhttp://www.makemytrip.comfor better deals.  As soon as I entered my tentative set of dates, the site listed a number of flights and what really impressed me was, I was even able to compare fares of different flights with just a click !  As I wanted information on halts, food, enroutes etc. concerning the flights I had short-listed, I contacted their customer care.  The conversation with the executive was very pleasant and he was uncomplainingly replying to all my queries.  After comparing the fares offered by them with other travel agents, I booked my air tickets through makemytrip without any problem & the tickets were delivered in a day in sealed envelope. = = = = = Some General Thoughts = = = = = http://www.makemytrip.comis basically a comprehensive website containing information on domestic / international flight fares & schedules, economical holiday packages, list of hotels ranging from regular to star categories, car rentals etc. all under one roof  ! PROS Every data is frequently & regularly updated The site has very good connecting speed & within a second of every click, you are taken to your desired link Makemytrip has a round-the-clock customer service helpline Good choices of flights for your specified dates / destinations When you look for holiday packages, the site jots down varieties of packages available for your preferred destination, enabling you to compare and decide your holiday package.  When the same is compared with any other outside source, the package of makemytrip does prove competitive. As for car rentals, you can choose your own choice of car as per your budget.  The site offers good car rental packages like Standard (Tata Indica, Ambassador, Omni), High Capacity (Qualis & Sumo) and Deluxe (Ikon & Esteem).  The rates offered are certainly reasonably priced. The site has an option called “Road Trips”, which gives you driving directions to proceed to your destination & the significance of your destination, the short routes etc. CONS As every coin has two sides, there are of course a few Cons here as well ! During our recent Goa trip, my cousin had booked us into a hotel through ‘makemytrip’.  About 5 hours before departure from our place, we called the hotel to confirm our reservation. We were shocked to receive a reply that we didn’t hold any booking.  When we called makemytrip customer care, the executive comforted us and confirmed that we did hold a booking & gave us a confirmation number.  When we called the hotel again, thank God, we were told that the particular reservation was made in the name of ‘makemytrip guests’ and the last procedure of giving the booking in our name was missed out by makemytrip people.  This was a last minute tension for us, but we realized that for every travel arrangement, it is mandatory to obtain a confirmation number for everything !! Speaking about another incident, my sister was planning a vacation to a few places in India.  We planned her trip through makemytrip.  But the customer care person missed out a couple of significant places en route the city they were traveling to.  It was as it is a long-awaited vacation which had come true after many years, but it was sickening to miss many lovely places depending on the information given by makemytrip !  So, for those who are going to plan your holiday, please don’t depend on just one source… always cross-check any information ! The Supersaver offers for car rentals in various cities listed in makemytrip never seem to be available for our desired dates.  Whatever date we enter, it keeps showing unavailable status & recommends some other nearest date. Overall,http://www.makemytrip.comis a pretty good effort and they have been successful also in introducing an useful website to the public, provided it is recommended that they also look into the grievances of the people and set right their flaws to acquire more customers !!",3
3478,"Having regularly used similar websites to get great deals during my stay in the US, I was happy to see MakeMyTrip and its ilk starting off in India. My personal experience with the website and their call center executives has been pleasant, with the representatives coming across as efficient and professional. The long wait times during busy slots are again a problem, like with any other call center. An auto response system to prevent loading the system with mundane queries would be a good addition. Besides booking flight tickets and other services, I once had to cancel a hotel booking I had made. The credit card charge reversal got delayed due to a human error at their side, but to their credit, the representative followed through and made sure the refund reached me. As the website gains credibility and acceptance, users should be able to get better deals. Currently however, the Kingfisher + VISA deal (20% cashback) seems the only noteworthy one. Otherwise, same fares can also be booked from the airlines' own websites. Their branding efforts in print and media should get them there soon. The real utility of MakeMyTrip is noticeable when trying to book a complicated trip - multiple airlines (e.g., when there is no direct flight), hotel and taxi. You can do this all from a ''single window'', without having to run/browse around to get the information required to compare various options. Existing competition like TravelGuru.com and travel sub-portals of established players like Indiatimes, Rediff etc. should keep MakeMyTrip on its toes in terms of customer service. T ravelocity has recently announces plans to expand in India, which also should soon entice its other competitors like Orbitz, Expedia etc to follow suit, once internet penetration in the country expands the market to support multiple operators. All this competition can only be good for the consumer! The days of unscruplous/inefficient small time ''travel agents'' seem to be about to end.",4

3480,"There were days when travelling was synonymus with railways.  We have travelled without a berth in our childhood when early bird caught worms.  Some members of the family would be at the railway station to grab seats, spread a durri the moment the train landed.  The rest of the entourage would land up with boxes and beddings and spread out to grab space.  Once marked, the seats were rarely re-taken.  The rest of the journey was spent in merriment and eating and running up and down the coach.  The slow labourious journey was exciting and adventurous. Then came the reservation system which worked fine in railways.  Your berth was booked in advance and there was no need to be junglee about it anymore.  One could arrive in time at the railway station and gently wave handkerchiefs at the seeing off party.  At most you could politely exchange top berths or window seats. Around the same time, catering started in the railway coaches and the adventure was lost.  You could have tea, water, chips and cutlets in the coach for asking and need not risk life and limb and possible desertation by trying to fill water bottles or buy puri alloo at one minute stops.  You still had long journeys and 4 hour delays in arrival. Now there are loads of private airlines who can transport you from point a to b in an hour's time without asking for an arm and and leg.  The only dilemma that plagues you now is which airline. To fix that dilemma, you have makemytrip.com.  Fill in the source and destination landings, the date of departure and you have a list of airlines and fares for your choosing.  You can pick on base of the rates, time of flight or the airline.  Whatever your priority.  Dont like the dates, jiggle a bit and change the dates, check what you like and choose. Unlike some airline sites, this one opens fast enough and gives you the information unfailingly. What it does not have, and what I wish for, is that you fill in the source and destination of your travel and get aweekly previewof the flights available.  That would be even more helpful in planning.  For instance, if I dont have a definate date of departure and can change it according to cheapest flight available, I might like a choice ! Also it would be useful if I enter a source and destination and it would give me alternate routes if available, for getting from point a to b.  For instance, if I needed to go to Darjeeling from Chandigarh, it should plan out a route from Chandigarh to Calcutta, Calcutta to Darjeeling.  At the moment makemytrip.com has only information on direct routes.",4

To cancel a ticket, there are no clear instructions on their website. Their 1800number doesn't get connected from any phone other than BSNL landline which are going hard to find. Its 2 months time now that they have not refunded my money. The website says in case of online cancellation the money should automatically get refunded which has not happened. A big disadvantage of booking thru them is that you have to shell out extra when you want to cancel the ticket. In my case the airline charged me the cancellation charges and then makemytrip also has charges associated with it. Well, I would say the best way to book tickets is get the lowest quotes from the site and book it directly with the airlines.",1
3483,"I went through similar excruciating pain.  Unlike the other fellow sufferer, I was struggling for money and this company, Makemytrip.com just decided to rob me and run with my money. I rather pay TWICE the money for a ticket, to someone else, than to pay these clowns even peanuts. They sell you a ticket at certain price, and then in next few days, you find out that the dates they sold you are not available and that they need to modify the itinerary. Then, they make up excuses and try to con you into taking flights which have many more stops and restrictions like there is no tomorrow. When you call Customer Care, you are reminded of why people commit suicides around the world.  I wouldn't be surprised if makemytrip.com and other such companies are responsible for all their deaths. Getting answers from them is like pulling a nail out with teeth. Oh, that Deep Karla or whoever is running this company.  They don't care.  You can e-mail and call as many times as you like, you never get to hear from him or his underdogs. You are better off doing business with some other company, better yet, start swimming across the Atlantic, you have lower of chances of being bitten by a real shark, as opposed to this company taking a bite out of you and your life and they don't care that you have a life that runs on schedules. I say, if there are lots of other people experiencing the same, let's file a class law-suit.  Get this damn company out of business, that will show them, who is in charge here.  Us, the customers.  Their company only exists due to us.  Without us, they won't have a damn circus with such clowns.",1
3484,"Attention Customers: This website looks for customers IP addresses. So,  if you asked for a ticket price today and then say, you planned to hold taking decision for some time. Again if you go back they will hike the price. If you use another ip address, they give you same old cheap deal. The idea is to create the tension in the customer that tickets are becoming expensive day by day. As a matter of fact it is not the case. I tried chatting with them from different IP addresses same time, with my recognized IP, they are increasing the price and new IP, they are giving me the  good deal. When I asked them why they are doing this, treating unfairly, they say their representative is NEW to work, so gave me wrong deal to my NEW ip address. Then I tried after 5 mintues with another IP, they gave me great deal, very cheap. And I asked them how many of your colleagues are NEW. This website is complete is scam, BE AWARE, affted customer. Do not loose money unnecessarily. YOu will get good deal. I have lost $500.00 in their cheap game. DO NOT make the same mistake.",1
3485,"Do not use these scam artists. They will try all sorts of tricks to make you pay more. For example, I tried to book a flight for May 29 but they say only flights are available for May 31. I changed my requested dates to May 27 and then they say only flights are available for May 29. What the #$@! So I managed to get around their software manipulation. They want us to believe our flights are not available and make us pay more in desperation for alternative flights at higher charges. And if you go to another travel website (like Orbitz) you will see that the very same flight that Makemytrip says are not available, does indeed have plenty of seats available. And what is with all these ridiculous taxes? 50% taxes on a flight? Just another way for them to make more money. Their customer service is also clueless. Takes them a while to get back to you and when they do so, they give contradicting information for your questions.",1
3486,"MakeMyTrip shot into public view with their aggressive marketing (neat campaign made by WebChutney guys). Lowest airfares, wish - click - go etc. sounded very promising. So, when I had to travel to Bangalore, I decided to use MakeMyTrip to book my air tickets. It all looked very good. Their website is cool and yes, the lowest airfare claim stands good. So, I booked 4 tickets for Delhi-Bangalore-Delhi. Payments done. Confirmations done. Problem starts. These guys promise a 3 business day delivery of tickets at your doorstep, a promise which fell apart terribly in my case. I booked my tickets on April 12th (Wed), and received a notification from my credit card company that payments have been made on the next day. So, I called up MakeMyTrip customer care (getting thru is pain, as always) and asked about confirmation and when will I get the tickets. The lady on the other end promised a 3 day delivery, and suggested me to wait till April 17th (Monday; Friday and Sunday were holidays). So, I waited, and Monday passed silently. On Tuesday, I called them up again. They told me that there was some problem and they are clearing tickets of passengers who are traveling on dates earlier than mine (awk!). I asked them if the tickets were ready for collection if I happen to drop into their office. The lady replied ''Sure! You will need to carry an identification proof''. (I am Cactus Jack) On the same day, I got an email from MakeMyTrip apologizing for the delay due to some technical snag and promised delivery in next 8 days. I decided to wait for a few days. I called them up again on Thursday. The enthusiastic lady from MakeMyTrip said that she will dispatch the tickets right away and I should get them in next 3 days (huh!?). The whole week passed. I have to travel in the first week of May and the last week of April was about to logon and I didn have the tickets. I kept trying the customer care on Sunday, but to no avail. All enthusiastic people were sleeping. Until now, I had this confidence that no matter what, I can go to their office and collect tickets from there manually (which is bad, but not as bad). So, I decided to pay them a visit on Monday, 24th April (12 days had passed till now). I went and demanded my tickets. The polite receptionist politely asked me to wait for 10 mins. Ok. About 20 mins passed. I pinged her. She said that she will just go and check the status. Ok. She came in 10 mins and told me that your tickets are coming in a moment. By now I realized that I am dealing with extremely slow and unprofessional people. After 45 mins in all, I told her very clearly what my problem is and for how long I have been put on hold. She hurried, went inside and came back in 10 mins with an ETA (Expected Time of Arrival) of 10 mins. She said that the executive is issuing tickets right now. Issuing tickets right now? Crazy crap! What the hell were you guys doing for 12 days? Sleeping over the money that I had paid? After exactly 10 mins, I went to her and asked her to check whats going on inside. She went inside and took 15 mins and came back with the tickets. I asked her what was the problem, and she replied innocently that there was some technical problem (doh! I should have guessed). I checked the tickets and found them as I ordered. So, 4 tickets actually got issued and delivered after 12 days and 1 hour. So much so for the 3 day delivery commitment. And so much so for Wish - Click - Go. Cherry on the cake - not 1 but 2. The lady did not ask me for any identification. I had to actually tell her that I was told that you guys need to see the identification (hilarious!). And just when I was leaving, the same lady told me that the executive forgot to stamp one of the tickets. So, she took them back and came back in 5 mins. I double checked the tickets and left. The other side: My friend Kamalmeet is also traveling to Bangalore. He got his tickets issued and delivered to him by a local travel agent in Connaught Place in half an hour precise. Impressive. Only pain he had to undergo was of traveling to Connaught Place and placing his order. So, MakeMyTrip guys, congrats! You guys lost your first time customer. I was moved into you by your advertisements. But after experiencing such unprofessional and amateur service, I am disappointed and find the local travel agent a better guy to deal with than you and your enthusiastic staff. Thank you.

3488,"Hi All, I stay in Bangalore, I booked a ticket on the MMT portal which was nice enough to make me believe it would provide some service. I Booked a Ticket from Delhi to Bangalore for 18 Apr on 10April 2006 for indian Airlines By the way MMT says IA ticketes will be Delivered through courrier in 3 working days. When I dint receive the ticket , I tried to reach them over the phone , which by the way I felt is the most diffucult thing in the world since I spent almost close to a Rs.1000 listning to the automated voice that says we are having high call volumes. Finally when I got in touch with them, they on16 Apr after I had reached delhi, they told they had some problem with IA and will deliver the Ticket to Delhi address by 16 apr , when I dint receive on 17th also I decided to hunt for the office in delhi and reach there since I dint wanna loose the flight on 18th morning, they tel me that the courrier has already been dispatached , but then I realised there that in that perticular office in Shri Aourobindo marg,Delhi, there were atleast 15 more people who had similar problem like mine and were stuggling to get  a ticket. After fghting for almost 1/2 hr and waiting for andother 1/2  , they finally agreed to issue me a duplicate ticket. This was one of my worst experience and would strongly recomend other to never use the MMT service. Regards Suraj",1
3489,"Well, I guess I got suckered by the sweet little con-job MMT pulled on the'complimentary free taxi drop' too. Sure enough, there was no taxi, nothing, except a very tired and sad looking lady from Kingfisher who told me that there were a few every day who fell for the same trick by this'makemytrick.com' people. On price, once you add up the taxes and service charges, you find that the total is costlier than buying direct from the airline. On cancellation, MMT levies its own add-on cancellation/re-scheduling charges which are very high, minimum 750/- or thereabouts. On liability, face it, the airline has every right to refuse carriage because the e-ticket/receipt is from MMT. On convenience, last minute/last-day deals are simply not possible on MMT, while they can be found on airline sites. On their new 20% back if bought through VISA deal, hang on! Might be a close relative of the'free taxi' business, and the fine print is quite impressive. All in all, MAKE MY TRIP is going to have to work harder and with better ethics if they want to survive. As of now, they appear to be just another dot-com pre-bust. Be careful before you trust them especially with your credit card details is all I can suggest. Dec 2011: Still as bad, maybe worse. April 2014 - used them and while they are reliable for booking airline tickets, the old issue is still not resolved so I guess that's forgotten. Upgrading to 4* and also changing to ""Recomend"" though I wish there were a ""NEUTRAL"" option too.",4

3491,"Well.......i'm back......back with a bang coz I just knocked over a glass of water lying besides my foot. If you've read my review on Jet airways, you'd know how much I despise airlines.....especially the ones who've got silly people sittin at their booking counters. So then.....since that experience with the Jet Airways booking babe, if I may call her that, I decided to book my tickets online......and since i'd heard a lot about makemytrip.com (courtsey TOI), I thought i'd try and check it out if it was worth all the hype. So I wanted to check out my interniary for a flight from Ahmedabad to Hyderabad and back........ firstly I filled out that little box asking me for the specifics and hit ENTER. The next thing that popped up on my computer screen was.....(read it carefully people....it comes back to haunt you later on) ''PLEASE WAIT, THE SITE IS SEARCHING ALL AIRLINES FOR THE BEST POSSIBLE FARES, WE ASSURE YOU THE WAIT WILL BE WORTH YOUR WHILE'' so I did......wait.....hoping it'd be worth my while. No Bill Gates I was.....i believe u've got that forwarded email which says that If Bill dropped a hmm....100$ bill, he wouldnt stop and pick it up, because he would earn more than that in the 4 seconds he just stopped to pick the bill up. Atlast though, the screen which I wanted to see did pop-up. And what do I see, they've got fares starting from 4500 for a ONE WAY trip. I scrolled through the screen again and scratched my chin trying to figure out what the hell was going on, since the last time i'd flown to Hbad and back, I had done it in 4000 bucks. Then I noticed that they only had the big players in, that is.....only the Jets, Sahara's and the Kingfisher's. The cheaper ones like Air Deccan and Spice Jet werent even shown in the list. So I assumed what we call in Gujju '''paisa khavdavya hashe' Jet, Sahara and Kingfisher e.'' The cheapest fare I noticed was Rs 4500 approx. for a one way trip to Hbad, while Air Deccan would take me to and fro for close to 4200 bucks. I gave the site one more shot, thinking just incase, the site forgot to search the low-cost carriers, but even them I got the same result. Moreover, if u do compare it with even the official Jet and Sahara sites, you'll notice a rate difference, not much......but still I guess......you can eat 3 more vadapau's if u book at the official Jet/Sahara site. Something more to ponder about is the fact, that the site does annouce that it will search ALL POSSIBLE AIRLINES, so you would 'prima facie' be inclined to think that 'yeah, the site did search all possible airlines'. This in my opinion, is a clear rip-off where the consumer has to bear a huge 2000 bucks extra for a one way trip while only getting a hot meal thrown in. And hey trust me, no food costing me 2 grand is gonna go down my stomach easily. One thing is for sure, i've definitely made up my mind never to use these guys again, coz with a lunch/dinner costing me 2 grand, i'd rather get a 130/90-17 rear tyre fitted on my bike or hey.....Under Section 25 of The Companies Act, 1956, i'd ask the Registrar of companies to change its website address to makemytrip.CON instead of makemytrip.COM",1
3492,"These guys have a nicely designed website ., and do promise airfares that are quite cheap compared to most others. However, it has been a nightmare dealing with them so far. I booked a ticket for Mumbai to Goa on the 2nd of March. They promised delivery within 3 days. It has been now 10 days, and numerous phone calls. I still don't have my ticket. Now they are blaming Indian Airlines, saying they created some problem with this ticket! I have purchased countless number of tickets from Indian Airlines directly from the net, and I  must say that I have never had any problems with that airlines. Make my trip is still promising me delivery  within a couple of days. When I asked them why they never bother to call me up when their promised deliveries fall through, they had no answers. Most of the time their phones are not attended , and you get this interminable ''we will be with you shortly'' thing. E-mails to them are never answered either. I wish I checked their ratings with Mouthshut earlier. Beware of these guys!",1
3493,"I was suggested by some friends that this site gave cheap tickets. I gave it a try. I booked a ticket for me and my family from Ahmedabad to Bangalore on Kingfisher airlines. While booking the ticket on KF airlines, I was given an offer of complimentery drop within city limit, unfortunately, they did not mention whom to contact at the airport for the same.  I had written to them on details of the pick, but they did not respond. I assumed it would be a offer from KF. But when I contacted the KF counter, they said it was the offer of makemytrip.com and I was left in the cold. I made my own arrangements to go home. When contacted them the next day, they said there was a goof up in the drop and would get back to me soon on how the goof up happend, the soon is now 2 weeks old. I thot I was given a ride by KF airlines, but it was makemytrip.com who literelly took us for a ride.

3494,"In december 2005 I used my credit card to avail the online services of makemytrip (MMT). They confirmed my payment and my booking. But on reaching the hotel, I was told there was no reservation! That was my first horrible experience with MMT. The second one is a customer's nightmare. In january 2006, MMT used my credit card details to process a payment on my card: without my knowledge, without my permission and without my authorization—and this time, I had not even bought their product/service!! When I saw my credit card statement and called them to complain, they reversed the payment after 1 whole week. Now they tell me it is perfectly fine and ethical to make such transactions on their customer’s credit card—because they are always ready and willing to reverse any such fraudulently processed payments—if the customer brings it to their notice! Stay away from this website, don’t even think of giving MMT your credit card details.",1

Since they have toll-free nos in US and India, I really thought it will be helpful to choose a travel agent with a presense in US and India. After I purchased the ticket, just 2 weeks before travel, we needed to cancel/reschedule the ticket.

Should you be travelling on a return ticket or having a stopover of more than 72 hours in a city, please do get your return/onward reservation reconfirmed by calling the airlines local office directly at least 72 hours prior to the departure time of flight. You need to report at the check-in counter at least three hours before the flight departure time. Kindly take a moment to review the details of your itinerary given below: TRAVEL ITINERARY: ____________________________________________________________ 4 days before the intended departure date - We have called up and spoken to a rep about this ''reconfirmation of itenerary'' while we have submitted a cancellation. The rep asked us not to worry about the email and verified and confirmed positively that our ticket has been cancelled and we should get our refund in 8-12 weeks. ______________________________________________________________ And a day before the intended departure date, we are on phone with a rep (P.S) who tells us that the ticket has to be used for an alternative date by paying $250 and fare-diff if any and can't be cancelled (inother words can't be refunded fully). We were not in a position to give an alternative for which we wanted to cancel the ticket. But she left us with no choice and forced us into choosing an alternate departure and return date. The matter ended with $250 towards date-change fees and a tentative new itenerary. _______________________________________________________________ Today, we want to finalize the itenerary and confirm the ticket. We spoke to customer rep (P.S) who asked to give 3 hrs to get back. After 8 hours, we got a call from another rep (S) who has no idea of this entire story upon receiving a mis-spelt email from (P.S) asking to just call us (and find out how we are doing!!). ________________________________________________________________ Out of my curiosity, I asked rep (S) what are the departments and people responsible for ticketing and related activities. Here is what I learnt: Me: Who handles booking and other activities? S: 1) Pre-Sales handles booking (and billing?) 2) Post-Sales handles cancellation, date-changes and etc., And they work with many other groups (airlines/sub-vendors/onsite group at US etc.,). I think both the groups have serious challenges in handling billing, cancellation and date-changes efficiently and also fail to set correct expectations with the customers. For example, S asked me to communicate with the same ''person'' for all my queries. I couldn't believe it. How am I going to know what shift/timeframe that ''person'' works in India. Then S suggested me to write email which is the best way to communicate since the ''person'' comes on night and day shifts alternatively each week. ___________________________________________________________________ Pros > Pre-Sales (Toll-Free Nos; 24 x 7 Customer Helpers (Yes we need a lot of help to do business with MMT) through email, chat and phone; Brand Name) Cons > Post-Sales (Systems + People + Processess - MMT should fix/replace some or all of them) Reps, Don't lose heart; work smart.

3504,"My name is Gary, I'm retired and I have a home in Las Vegas, Nevada and an apartment outside Shanghai, China. In March 2005 I usedmakeymytrip.comto plan a 19 night 20 day trip out of Delhi. This was my first trip to India and we had a terrific time. The trip was very well planned and the hotels were often the''fairly tale''variety even though I only paid for three star hotels. The bottom line on this outfit is they are legitimate, they won't cheat you and they know what they are doing. I toured their offices in Delhi. The building looks bad but the offices are very nice. They look like they have a staff of about 25 people on three floors. They didn't bill my credit card until I showed up in Delhi where they picked us up at the airport. We made our own flight arrangements. I dealt directly with Ajay in Delhi via email and not with their New York office. Our driver for the trip was Dinesh and he was very good. The trip cost me a grand a week for everything including car and driver and all hotels which included breakfast. I suspect you pay about a 30% premium for their services over what you could do yourself. However this outfit will completely plan your trip to the best sites and they did put us in some magnificent hotels.Prince Charles and Lady Dieven stayed in one of them! I suspect that if you just hired your own car and driver and let him take you places that you would end up in shoddy hotels where the driver got the best kickback. We actually ate lunch in some of the other hotels in some towns and I could see we were in a much better hotel than other tourists. That's the positives and here are the negatives (negatives are more fun): I suspect that scams and hustles are a way of life in India. If you've been there then you know that. So makemytrip.com did come up with an itinerary and price and I said everything looked fine and I chose the three star hotel option. Then the next day I got an email suggesting I pay another $300 for an air conditioned car. If you travel in India you must be able to roll up the windows. So this was a bit shoddy. Then I got to thinking what else they could hit me up for and sure enough they were going to charge an extra 4% for my use of a Visa card (normal in India). I got them to reduce the $300 to $150 and the Visa charge to 2%. A plus is that they charge your Visa card in New York City. If you use a Visa outside the USA now, Visa will tack on a 3% charge so this is a big plus for makemytrip. The price did include local guides in each of the cities we visited. After three of these guys I realized that using them was a bit like inviting a time share salesman to join you for the day. Bad news. So I called Ajay on my cell phone and cancelled all the local tour guides and he agreed to refund the money for them. Ajay said they were government licensed people and he had no control over them - made sense to me. Most of what they did was hit me up for a big tip, take me to overpriced lunch spots where they got a big kickback and then on to grossly overpriced tourist markets to get another kickback. They were very useful when they were touring a site with you. Oh, the first guide couldn't keep his hands off my girlfriend. But this is not makemytrip's fault. If you like you can hire a guide almost anywhere - they will pester you to hire them if you don't have a guide. Another problem I had was that makemytrip said the price included all entrance fees. They didn't say that all the sites you visit are ''monuments'' and monument fees were not included. I called Ajay on this and he agreed to pay our entrance fees to the ''monuments.'' So I'm happy with this outfit and the trip was one of the best in my life. India is fascinating/bizarre/unique. Bring your GSM cell phone and get a SIM card as soon as you arrive so you can complain to Ajay if you have a problem and call your driver whenever you need to. Bring a bottle of Pepto Bismol for each person. ATMS are everywhere and worked with my ATM card. Bring a three pronged (round prongs) electrical adapter for India for battery charging. Final comment: try doing a trip like this in Europe for a grand a week! This was a very worthwhile deal.",4
3505,"Well, it's been over a year since I used MakeMyTrip's services and like my past experience, it was all in order. I remember the last time I had good things to say about them, comments by 2 users in particular, delhi10 and benjamin_simon (who seemed to be agreeing with everything the other guy had to say across all reviews!) accused me of being an employee of the travel agency and a PR rep...aaah, what  would the world be without sceptics. Anyway, I had to book an internal tour for some friends and me to visit Goa and Jaipur from Delhi. I called up their 1-800 number in India and admit that I had to wait at least 5 minutes after being on hold for someone to help me. However, that minor hiccup aside, I got super airfare deals that were cheaper than what I saw on the Spice Airlines (I think that's the airline name) website and a great hotel rate for about $200 bucks during January in Jaipur. They got me a great deal in Goa as well at a resort called Casa De Goa that was absolutely the most charming boutique hotel I've seen. To those who haven't had a great experience with these guys...booking online is always a hit or miss experience. There are good and better websites out there but at the end of the day what makes or breaks it is the service and conveninece being offered. MakeMyTrip might not be the best website but because of a few hitches, it certainly doesn't make it all that bad either. It's easy to write people off because of a not-so-good experience but it's also worth giving them a second chance if the product offering is worthwhile. I'm sure they've taken heed of all the not so positive comments and feedback and are taking steps to fix the problems, whatever they are! Oh well...I better not support them too much for fear of being accused of being ""one of them"" again! :)",4
3506,"I have read all the reviews and have been a victim of it just 2 days back.I called these guys to book a ticket for my fiancee. I was given a deal of $1200 and was been told that when you will make a final booking you`ll get some discount.The guy called me and emailed me for booking for the next 2 days. Finally I made up my mind and called them again and they gave me deal of $1190. I was okay with it and gave my final YES for it. I sent them my credit card info and along with other formality which I had to send to the their New York office.I was happy that I got a good deal. but hey!!!!!!......... in 2 hrs I got a call that the itinerary I booked is not available ??????!!!.. I got shocked. And finally after talking for 2 hrs I was told that if you still want the same itinerary,you would have to pay $1452. I got stunned.. but I didnt loose my hope.. I tried my best(removed the uncensored words..). I wanted to paste all the converstation and mails I had to write. I spoiled my whole day in the arguments. The whole incompetent team and leadership.. totally crap. But finally, I got the same itinerary at the same price and for the same dates!! One shouldn`t loose hopes coz its our hard earning money. My question ishow can the itinerary changed in 2 hrs from 1190 to 1452 even though I gave the money and all other formalities??and How did it came back to the same price after I screw*d them with my words? Please do not loose your hopes if you went through anything with them. Just write to everyone in the list given on their sites and you will win. They dont know that client is GOD! and you cannot make them unhappy. I wish you all the best for your future dealings with them.",1
3507,"I recenly purchased tickets fromMakeMyTrip.This is the first time I booked my tickets through MakeMyTrip. I am so impressed with the service, I am recommending this to my family and friends here in USA and India. Their service is more professional and prompt than the US Indian travel agencies. In US esp in New York there are many small time agents who may give slightly less price but their services are just horrible. But MakeMyTrip is great in terms of service and prices. My whole transaction went pretty smooth. The agents were very helpful and courteous. They helped me in procuring confirmed tickets at a good price for December season travel from USA to India. The agent really worked hard to get me the seats. Initially it looked that I'll have to cancel my December travel plan but this polite agent rescued it and gave me what I wanted. These guys are easily accessible as well. Whether it's day or night they are just a call away. I did not face any problem with that. They even have chat facility on their website. This is a very good feature eps if one is chatting from office and can't make a call. Kudos to them..",5
3508,"I had a pretty good experience with this company. I used their services for the first time to book a ticket from LA to Chennai last month. The sales person was really helpful, efficient and VERY patient with me ? I had a lot of questions and she gave me all the options available. The part I liked best was being able to call them on a 1-800 number. I think there are very few travel agents you can actually trust these days since everyone is trying to make a fast buck but these guys are reliable. Their prices are pretty low and even if you do end up paying a little more, at least you have the satisfaction of knowing that they won?t disappear after selling you a ticket. A friend of mine recommendedMakeMyTrip.comto me and I would definitely tell anyone planning to travel to India to check them out.",4
3509,"Guys, Stay away from these bunch of goons. They will hit you with hidden charges. Here is what happened... I booked my trip to india, and they charged me $1700 oppose to my local travel agent who quoted me $1300. Don't ask me why I went with these baffoons, but I did make that mistake, maybe that is why I had to go through all the crap they put me through. I requested a date change for a month after, and this clown1 named ''(I dont want to identify names here, so I will call them clown1,2 a and so on) made the changes. We agreed to the dates and he conformed that the changes were made. I was charged $275 for the change fee. I changed my vacation accordingly with my employer, and made plans in India, including booking of other airfares, hotels etc. Three days later I get a call from clown1 saying that he forgot to make the changes and now the dates are no longer available. The first available dates were 2 months out. I was totally screwed at that time. I was left with no choice but to accept the dates. I had to cancell all my plans in India and rebook everything. I lost $1400 in that process. I got very upset about it, and called them and asked to speak with management. Clown 2 comes into picture. He goes back and forth for over 10 days and tells me that they are sorry. At that pont I asked that I should not be charged the change fee and should have a refund for $275. Not that I was hurting for money, I wanted to make sure that they realize that they have made a mistake. They even admitted that the fee is not charged by the airlines, its charged by makemytrip.com. To cut the long story short, here is the email I received from clown 3. Dear : We have complete information about your date change transaction. The reason why I asked was to check if you can again take the dates that you wanted originally and not because we are not aware of the details. This way we could have tried to get you the dates of your choice, but now that you have already accepted the alternate dates, this option is ruled out. I'm sorry but we can't refund the date change penalty. To make up for this we can give you a discount of $50 in your next purchase. On your acceptance we will send you discount voucher for this value. Best regards, Clown 3 Upon receiving this email I called their management in NY, and clown4 at their NY office told me that that is their profit and they dont give back their profits. I also sent a message to their owner/management to call me, but I have ot heard back. I am not sure what next steps I would take, but one thing is for sure that this was by far the worst experience I have ever had with a travel agent. Here is an update:I got another email from so called management: Dear Mr. I have examined your case details and found that the alternate travel dates were accepted by you and only after that the ticket was reissued and card charged. If the alternate dates were not suitable, we won't have charged the penalty. Since the processing of date change was done with your acceptance, at this stage we can't refund the penalty. However we can give you discount coupon of USD 50 in your future travel. We appreciate your business. Best Regards Clown5 My response to them: Clown5, You are missing the whole point. I agreed to alternate dates because I was given no choice. I think I am at the end of my rope here with you guys. I am going to go through other channels. I have requested time and again that someone from management call me to talk about this, but I have not heard from anyone. This is pathetic. Another update: I got a call from Clown5, and after 20 minutes of arguements he says that he does not have all the details and he needs to talk to all the other clowns that I have mentioned above, and will get back to me. Everytime I think this cannot get any more worse, it only gets more. Another update. I got an email from Clown5 saying that he will get back to me, but never did. Here is my response to Clown 5 and I copied the management along with my response. Clown5: This is exactly what I expected out of you guys. Nothing. This is a message for your senior management a.k.a Deep Kalra. Give me a call@xxxxxx xxxx . I would like to discuss with you my next steps, including but not limited to reporting your little scam to BBB, report the fraud to local authorities, expose your money extortion scheme to local news stations, and last but not least take appropriate legal actions. I am also goiing to talk with my credit card company to see how they can help me. I just want you guys to know that I am only taking these actions because you have left me with no choice. I gave you enough chances to find out what happened, and to correct it,. but obviously, I was wasting my time. Another Update: I guess sending the above messge did get someone's attention, and they decided to refund back the $275. My credit Card company was also very helpful in the matter, and affirmed that they would reverse the charges if makemytrip.com did not returned the money. I also got a call from Makemytrip.com asking me to tak this review off, as this is exposing them in the market place. BEWARE: They have now increased the fees to $325 from $275. I can't believe they are actually able to get away with this, especially when airlines is not the one charging it. What a bunch of thieves. ANOTHER UPDATE!!!!! Just when I thought that all of this was behind me. Starting last week, I started getting 10+ email in my inbox. I replied back and asked them to take me off their spam list. They agreed, but I am still getting all that scam. Following is a message to the management..... You people should respect others requests and not bombard them with spam on an hourly basis. I would like to request that you remove me from your spam list. I do not want to deal with you guys any more. I am fed-up. I have reported you guys to all the known ISPs as spammers.",1
3510,"I had a great experience booking my trip from NYC to Mumbai throughMakeMyTrip.comto say the least! This is my second time of booking my travel to India with them and I think they are the BEST in the field! Their travel consultants helped me out on my reservations, were helpful and resourceful and answered all my questions with patience and really handled the situation very well even though I made a number of changes in the itinerary. I am sure the level of efficiency and professionalism exhibited by all of them reflects the commitment their organization has towards its customer. They have also started a loyalty program exclusively for their customers and must say the sops are good. Got Free access to Business Lounges at the airport and quaite a few discount coupons for shopping and eating out in India! I am really impressed by the experience that I had with MakeMyTrip. Makemytrip will be my first choice for any of my travel needs in the future as well. Rhea Sethi",5
3511,"I was taken aback by the amount of negative responses about MMT. I guess this is one of the cases like mine when I had serious problem with British Airways. My friends and I have used their services and have not really found any major cause of complaint. The only problem I had was that they had to rebook the next day because the original flight was withdrawn. I only found out when I called up the airline to give my food preferences. I called them and they sent me a new itinerary and they e-mailed me. What ticked me off was that they had rebooked be on the next day without asking me first. Of course they were of great help when I called them in India. The advantages are that they have a 24/7 toll free number in India, USA and Australia. I still think that they cause less trouble than the average agents who are very rude usually and cause a lot of trouble. I would suggest that MMT is still a better option than other agents in terms of reliability. The one other problem is that they quote higher than the average agent. But I suppose that is a price to pay for the 1-600 or 1-800 number.",4
3512,"Mr. Deep Kalra, You need to read this review completely. Do me a favor guys - email this review to every friend of yours in United States and other places and let them also know what a disgraceful company MMT is and warn them NEVER EVER to book their tickets from this company. Note:Everything in italics is an actual talk between and agents of MakeMyTrip (referred to now as MMT). Some Names (the first one only) have been changed to maintain confidentiality between me and the good people. Me: Hi, I did like to book a ticket to India in another fifteen days, say around 20th... Preeti (Name Changed): Of course, we will be able to help you out in this regard... may I know where you would want to travel Me: I did want to go from BWI to Bangalore.. Preeti (After some searching for fares...): I can at best get you on 23rd, via Air India through Paris to Bangalore... Me: How much is the deal? Preeti: Around 1600$ sir Me: Well, thats pretty steep, don't u have anything else? Preeti: Lemme check... (Preeti goes into searching mode, over which she also teaches me how to make Alu Gobi and promises to visit me to taste the Alu Gobi; meanwhile I am wondering did I really need this buttering - maybe I did :) ) Preeti: Sorry, but I cannot get anything other than 23rd... Me: Well allright then go ahead and book it - do u accept credit cards? Preeti: We take a sign in amount for 250$ on credit card, and if you wish to pay entire amount, we will levy 4% extra charge on it, else you can send a cheque to our New York Office... Me [wait a minute...aren't they based in US only??]: Okie... Welcome to one of the worst online booking travel agency in the history of 21st century. MakeMyTrip does make your trip, of course with a lot of chaos, pathos and mental agony. If based in United States, they did be sued by now for Million dollars and closed down. They excel not only in booking tickets, but also in harrassing their customers to the maximum extent possible, and as if to prove their points employ a bunch of monkeys whom they fondly call ''travel wizzies'' or ''travel consultants''. MMT was founded by a person Mr. Deep Kalra, an IIM-A graduate, who specializes in management -  Err, if IIM-A couldn't help him gather a good team to run his business, just shows the sorry state of affairs this  company is in. Lackluster service, Third Class Attitude, Gossiping Idiots and other splendid forms of monkeys form their  crew called agents. I bet even Indian Railways does a better job of Customer Service. For the first time when I should have used Mouthshut to my advantage and checked out reviews on MS for MMT, I did have not gone to them at all, for this website gets a single star on most of the reviews penned, while the ones penning it highly wrote a single review (indicating suspicious play) and vanished away. How I wish I had used Mouthshut for the very purpose it was created :-( After a few days and a couple of voice messages on my cell phone telling me about confirmation, dispatching my ticket… Richa: Sir your bank did not approve the transaction for some reason and your tickets have been dispatched... Me: Oops! I am sorry - can I send another check? Richa: No sir, If you can send a demand draft... Me: Go ahead and charge my credit card Richa: You will be charged 4% extra Me: No problem. Go ahead and charge it. I apologize for this mistake. Richa: Thank you MMT basically lacks what is called as management itself. That it is made up of complete idiots is well evident from the events that followed afterwards. Not only they talk like idiots on the phone, they also have no idea what they are talking about. They have no centralized management of customer details, and even if there is, it is evident they don't use it - Result? Everytime you call them up (of course they never call you back once u pay them money), you have to iterate and re-itearte your problems freshly to every person whom you talk to. Thursday Morning... Me: My credit card has been charged twice for the amount of 1600$ [of course the whole series of events was described] XYZ (Didn't get that idiot's name): We will look into the matter sir... and a person will get back to you Friday Morning... Me: My credit card was charged twice for the amount of 16004 [Again, the whole events followed] XYZ (Another idiot whom I didn't get): We will look into the matter... Sunday Morning... Me: ...Yes, My creidt card was charged.....blah blah Manoj: Our accounts department will look into it sir and someone from our side will get back to you with the details.  MMT people gossip and do nothing about people on the call. They lack a basic web management ticket system for any problem definition too. All it takes is a day of coding, yet unimaginative people at MMT don't seem to realize the importance of having a ticket based systems. Result? I need to tell each monkey what my problem in great details, since in all probability he/she never heard of me at all. Why can't they have a simple web ticketing system? Suppose I get a trouble ticket and that ticket is stored so that I don't need to bark again and again? CRM anyone? Mr. Deep Kalra sure seems to be bereft of any positive ideas for his company. Or I guess, they simply don't bother about it since Indian customers are anyways useless for their business. Monday morning (of course no body got back is another matter)... Me: ...Damn it..My credit card was... Richa: Yes sir, I am sorry sir...I apologize for it sir... Me: Don't give me apologies! Give me a solution! Richa: you know sir, we have been working since 8.00 pm in evening and now its 3.30 am in morning... Me: IS THAT MY PROBLEM? I dont care when you work or what you are doing! My credit card has been blocked and I need it to be refunded. Richa: you will need to fax us a copy of your credit card statement to our New York Office Me: WHAT???? WHY WASN'T I TOLD THIS ON THURSDAY? Richa: I don't know whom you talked with sir, but I am giving you right information Me (almost calling her a bitch): Do you have morons working at MMT? And what happened to your accounts department who were going to check the stuff? .... Monday Night Me: Hello...yes...my credit card was charged twice.......(damn these idiots) Manoj: Sir I left a message on your voice mail Me: Really? How come I get 4 voice messages a day and NOT yours? Manoj: We are looking into the matter, would you kindly send the report Me: I will - But I need to get my money back. Do you realize how much difference its making here - I cannot USE my credit card at ALL! I need to do some shopping Manoj: I apologize sir...I will personally make sure someone will contact you and solve the matter in hours.... I work in an internet company and lot of times there are double credit card charges - however I have PERSONALLY done this - all it takes is not more than an hour to really find out about the problem. There is no such thing as ''Accounts Dept'' will do this and that - If a good billing system exists, immediately all details get provided. So what does MMT feel then? They are bunch of robbers who want to loot the customer's money. Sorry Mr. Deep Kalra, you are a messed up beggar and your company is made up of even more pathetic beggars than you yourself.

3513,"Just a click - A clear and accurate information on this site made my travel easy. But till I spoke to the agent on toll free no. I was not sure of what was being offered on the net. The agent on phone offered me the best possible connections and the lowest possible fares. The service was simply the best I have ever thought of. I was offered a wide range of carriers and fares. The customer service agent was thorough with the airlines and their routes,in-flight and ground services, connecting time and prompt in response.The timely delivery of the ticket and  choice of making  payment- by credit card, traveller check or cash all together made my travel easy. It was hassle free and comfortable journey as compared to my previous sevral trips. Makemytrip really made my Trip fantastic and care-free. I highly recommend this portal for making a smart travel plan.",5
3514,"I tried to 'chat' with this company on getting a r/t ticket. but kept getting the message ''Operators are busy taking care of others'' for 30 minutes.  I guess, I have to take my business elsewhere, won't I? Tried to be brief, and to the point but was forced to write a minimum of 100 words - which, in my honest opinion is truly a waste of time and forces the writer to write unnecessarily. In today's world of IT one can appreciate things are done with less words and less time.  Its called ''getting to the point'' and then moving on to more important things.",1
3515,"I read the other two reviews and was quite surprised. my experience with them was completely different. they were fast, efficient and cheaper than my local dallas agent. I highly recommend them...the staff was very polite and all of it took about 10 minutes. keep it up! the main thing that really helped was 24-hr availability. toll free numbers and online chats...a big help. i'd call them at strange hours of the day and night and each time, they were extremely helpful and patient. I made a few changes to my ticket and without a fuss, all the changes were taken care of. it was wonderful doing business with them.",5
3516,"Booking the ticket in this website is a waste of time and money. Either the computers or the toll free numbers will be down when you book the ticket.  Still you have to pay high price for the ticket.  Don't make your life complicated, there are many travel agents in US who can give much better rate and professional service than makemytrip.com. I made a mistake of buying the ticket from this website, which I will never make again also never recommend to anyone. For example Makemytrip.com price for a ticket is $1200/- where as same ticket is available for $1050/- with local travels agents.  Local travel agents will book the ticket in 5 minutes to half an hour, where as makemytrip.com took 5 hours, because most of the time their agents are busy in fixing their computers.  By the time computer starts working, toll free numbers are down.",1
